TE01,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday .... February 11, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Cold Comforts and Solid Beef -- Austin Amenities and Festivities -- The Water-God Flower -- Railroad Legislation -- Too Much Confidence</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., February 7, 1883.</p><p>EDITOR ENTERPRISE:  During the last few weeks the temperature of the ""Great East"" portion of Nevada has ruled unusually and unnecessarily low, the thermometer ranging from twenty or thirty degrees above zero to forty or fifty degrees below.  The cattle ranges being altogether in the numerous valleys, where the coldest weather prevails, there has been considerable suffering among the four-legged friends, servitors and victims of the human race.  Cattle do not suffer so much from the severe cold as from the freezing up of the streams, springs and ponds, cutting off their water supply, and were there no snow many would have to perish from thirst.  Snow rarely falls deep enough to prevent sheep from getting along comfortably, and the abundant white sage forms a never-failing source of nutritious food supply for cattle and horses throughout the Winter season.  Along the Humboldt Valley section the cold is far the most intense, and it is said that the butchers, after slaughtering, have to work lively to get off the hide before the animal freezes solid.  In cutting off steaks and roasts they run the petrified carcass through a sawmill.  Here in Austin, the oldest inhabitant, who is a member of the Reese River Pioneer Society, repeatedly declares that he never before saw the like anywhere for cold weather.  We are all getting so used to it, however, that it only seems uncomfortable when it gets above zero.</p><p>AUSTIN DIVERSIONS.</p><p>Following close upon the debilitating result of the general election in November came the mumps.  That uncomfortable disease descended upon the population of this venal burg as a sort of righteous retribution for degenerating from its former glory as a Republican city, and deliberately gravitating into the arms of the Democracy.  Yet it afflicts all, both great and small, regardless of sex, age or previous condition of politics.  No fatal results have ensued thus far, but mature sinners have suffered severely from it, and the doctors are all wallowing in affluence.  The average Austinite, however, has not let the mumps get down into his feet.  He bags his head and extra amount of cheek, and mumps about for a few days, and then goes to a dance and kicks out the last lingering mump from the festive points of his toes and heels.  And we have lots of dancing parties, balls, socials and all that sort of thing, and just as good halls as those of the Montezumas to do it in, and as for music, here is where it naturally exists, evolves and trots out The Lander Brass Band is one of the best military bands in the State, and we have two good quadrille bands, to say nothing of a Chinese band, which for brass, string and general outlandish anti-musical cussedness cannot be beaten this side of Tophat.  At the recent famous masquerade ball, in International Hall, the various characters taken were so perfectly sustained that you could hardly distinguish ""Pluto"" from the ""Abolition Oil Man,"" the ""Sailor Boy"" from ""Mrs. Langtry, "" or the ""Chinese Mandarin"" from the ""Swiss Peasant Girl,"" but we had lots of fun and explained all the characters in the newspaper report.  Then there was the sheet and pillow-case ball the other night, where everybody danced and sweated in their bed-clothes, and whisperingly confessed identity to each other, so that nobody was surprised when the unmasking came.  The annual ball of Manhattan Hose Company No. 2, and that of the Austin German-Americans were also ""away up.""  The coming Valentine party, to be given by our German-American citizens, will doubtless be the most popular and socially enjoyable event of the season.  All these festive assemblages are invariably very fully attended, whole families as well as parts of families being present, and juvenile Austin as he skips about the floor or sits waiting for a chance, admiringly contemplates the ambitious terpsichorean efforts of some noble old pionerrs, and hopefully looks forward to the day when he, too, shall be able to come down in the double shuffle or the fore-and-after like a Starratt, a Crockett, or a Cresenzo.</p><p>CHINESE NEW YEAR</p><p>Commenced to-day, but the moon-eyed, long-tailed sons of Confucius so numerously residing here, commenced celebrating before dark last evening.  Wheelbarrow loads of fire-crackers, bombs, etc., were exploded, and the Chinese band paralyzed the devil with some of the most soul-harrowing fulminations from their tom-toms, gongs, hewgags and squiljees that he ever heard.  Chinatown was a blaze of glory, freshly stirred up stinks and hilarity.  The Joss-house was brilliantly lighted, and the gaudily painted Joss himself seemed to wear an agreeable smile on his celestrial features.  Feasts of roast and stewed hog and chicken, cakes, nuts and pic-led chow-chow indescribable were spread in various houses, everybody visited each other, drank rice brandy, got celestially happy and had lots of fun.  To-day the big dragon flag rollicks gaily in the breeze from the flagstaff of the little red-faced Chinese Masonic temple, and John is quietly taking a rest and a smoke, or cruising about in his best dangaree pants and silk jumper.  This is a happy, hopeful and satisfactory occasion for John.  This is the day when he forgives all his creditors, puts himsefl through bankruptcy, wipes out all his old scores and opens new accounts for himself for another year.  This is his annual clean-up, so to speak; therefore it is most emphatically and essentially John's ""Happy New Year.""</p><p>CELESTIAL HYACINTHS.</p><p>We have all admired the beautiful Chinese lilies or hyacinths which are to be found growing so luxuriantly at this particular time of the year in parlor windows and barrooms most anywhere in this State as well as in California, and right now they should be in their fullest glory of blooming fragrance.  They grow best in bowls or dishes filled with stones and water, no other nutriment or cultivation being required, and the onion-like bulbs are imported in large quantities fresh from China every year, not being propagated in this country at all.  It is a very interesting plant, and in Mongolian circles it is considered to have cabalistic and oracular bearing upon the Chinese New Year, as well as Celestial luck generally.  Most carefully and anxiously does each Chinaman consider the growth of his lilies, and endeavor to regulate their floral development.  If every bud is in full bloom on the China New Year's Day he is in a bonanza of luck and prosperity for the whole of the year, but every flower that droops or fades on that day is a sure sign of a death in his family - if all should wither, ruin and death must be his portion before the next new year.  Ah Quy, or ""Charley,"" the Chinaman whom all the old Comstockers remember as being for several years employed in the Bank Exchange Saloon at Gold Hill, told me the following nice little legend regarding this peculiar flowing plant, which is now put in print for the first time:</p><p>THE ""SOI SIN FWAR,""</p><p>Or Water-God Flower, is only found in one particular province away in the interior of China, and nowhere else in the world.  A good many hundred years ago a very rich and prominent mandarin died, and his eldest son, in accordance with law and national custom, suceeded him as legal heir to the family title and possessions.  He was a bad, arrogant and ambitious man, and about the first thing he did was to turn his mother and younger brother out of doors.  Indeed, he wanted to kill them, in order to destroy all chance of their eventually succeeding to the estate, instead of his own children.  The poor mother gathered up a handkerchief full of nuts and dried fruit, took her little boy by the hand and fled for safety she cared not whither.</p><p>Three days afterward they found themselves away out in the midst of a broad desert country covered with stones and water, and not a tree, bush or even a blade of grass in sight.  It was New Year's Day, and with bleeding feet and broken hearts they sank down weeping and exhausted upon a rock, unable to go any further, and concluded they must die.  Pretty soon a little gray-haired old man came tottering along and sat down beside them.  ""Why do you weep?"" said he.  They told him their story and wept afresh.  The old man looked very sad, tired out and hungry, and the little boy gave him what few nuts and dried apple they had left.</p><p>Then the little old man raised up without the assistance of his stick and smilingly remarked, as he patted the astonished boy on the head:  ""Now I know you.  Don't you cry any more.  I'll make you ten times richer than your big, bad brother ever was or ever will be.  Just stand up upon this rock and I'll show you something.""</p><p>They both stood up there beside him and he pointed with his stick.</p><p>On all sides, far and near, they saw those beautiful hyacinths, with full white blossoms, growing in the water among the stones and rocky crevices.</p><p>""There, now,"" said the genial old gentleman, with a hilarious nourish of his stick, ""all this vast tract stones and water is yours. I give you everything in sight. Not one flower is withered or drooping. Sell them and be as rich and prosperous as you like.""</p><p>A heavy cloud of rich perfume, like incense from the throne of Joss, floated across their delighted nostrils, and they turned to thank the old man, but he was gone.</p><p>Then they knew it was the great Water God, Choon Tung, whom they had thus profitably entertained. They loaded themselves with the lovely fragrant blossoms and struck out for the nearest city. They sold at fabulous prices, and directly had coolie trains packing flowers to all parts of the empire, even supplying the Emperor and his entire court, at a magnificent profit.</p><p>When the bad elder brother heard of all is he went on an opium jamboree, and died inside of a week, leaving the young man and his mother sole inheritors of the situation. They settled down on the old homestead, and he became in due time a two-sworded Mandarin of the red button, in prime favor with the Emperor, making his mother one of the highest ladies in the land.</p><p>In appreciative gratitude and honor they named this beautiful hyacinth Soi Sin Fwar, or the Water God Flower, which name it bears to this day, and their descendants, heirs and assigns continue selling the bulbs.</p><p>RAILROAD MATTERS.</p><p>It is pleasing to notice that our legislators at Carson are standing up to their respective party platform pledges regarding the monstrous railroad monopolies, which are trying to develop the resources of our otherwise poverty-stricken State. Buncombe and partisan rivalry can get up political platform resolutions, but it requires good, square legislative brains to carry out the desired propositions. Previous Nevada Legislatures have found this railroad problem a difficult one to definitely arrange with equitable justice to both sides, and at the same time keep in view the future prosperity of the State, which can be developed, enhanced and supported more by railroads than most anything else; and the chances are that the present Legislature may arrive at the same honest sagebrush conclusion. The railroad between here and Battle Mountain has not made whisky money or its unfortunate proprietors in the last two years, and can stand no squeezing discouragement whatever; the Nevada and Oregon road certainly cannot, and, what other road can? The people of this section have little confidence in any decisive benefit to be derived from any of the proposed railroad bills. No harm, however, can be done by agitating the subject, even though no definite action should be taken. Our legislators have a right to show that they recognize their platform requirements and are ""fly to the racket."" Speaking of</p><p>CONFIDENCE,</p><p>The other day a well-known and active young man of this town unfortunately exhibited too much confidence. He was on top of a building, fixing a private telegraph wire, and when he got through, jumped from the fire wall, some four or five feet, down upon an awning covered with sheet iron. This gave way beneath him like so much paper, and he shot through to the sidewalk below, falling about seventeen feet. He looked before he leaped, but did not calculate on going so far. Luckily, he did not break his neck or any other bones, but says he would rather have the mumps than do that circus act again.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE01.jpg,territorial
TE02,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday	.....	February 18, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Valentine Amenities — An Autograph Epidemic—Chirographic Sublimity—Water Pipe Calamities—Juvenile Ambition—Railroad Legislation—Government Rations and Piute Prosperity</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nevada, February 15, 1883.</p><p>Saint Valentine's Day came in as a sort of wind-up to the Chinese New Year festivities, and was further complicated with the commencement of Lent. One circumstance operated as an offset to the other, however, to some extent. The Chinese had their big dragon flag flying all day, and the Jews danced at the grand ball given by our German citizens in the evening, but the good Catholic Christians stayed at home, under the restraints of Lent. The average American Austinite, however, tried to make a festive day of it. A violent snow-storm gave about eight inches of splendid sleighing, and in the afternoon and evening, numerous gay cutters and spanking teams were dashing about the streets. The ball was very well attended and much enjoyed, every person present receiving a valentine, besides having lots of social fun. The Post office did a huge business, especially in the forwarding and exchange of cheap, wicked and acrimoniously exasperating valentines. Schoolboys got even on their teachers by sending them the meanest and most soul-harrowing of these cheap missives, and many a reflective citizen slyly sought grim satisfaction for past or existing grievances in the same way. And it is of no use saying that these villainous pictorial exaggerations do not hit strongly or have any effect. One hard business man received three, apparently from different persons, but all three were alike. He stood over an hour before a looking-glass, swearing that he had no such nose and ears and did not love money to the extent so aggravatingly set forth in those horrid valentines, and then he went and got drunk.</p><p>AUTOGRAPHIC</p><p>The autographic album epidemic is more annoying and permanently distressing than the mumps. I’ve young or old miss in Austin has at least one of these nefarious concerns, and they are afflicted with an abnormal desire to get them filled up autographic remarks and names, quantity and number being apparently the main object in view. Thus, for one autograph of any note or prominence they have forty never heard of before, or likely to be even remembered for any length of time. The young gentleman of unfortunately high popularity among them naturally falls an easy victim to general desire for his autograph, and the way they pile the little albums in upon him is really oppressive. Where he fails is in attempting to sling a verse or two of poetry into each of them, instead of simply recording himself ""Yours, eternally, J. Bilkington Boggs,"" or something after that style. Many persons, too, seem to be saturated with the idea that they can write themselves into prominence through the mediumship of these autograph albums, therefore they go for them, and seek to improve the glorious opportunity. The result is that the whole motley assort­ment, from the two-bit affliction up to the $3 pictorial atrocity, gets filled with more bad penmanship and still worse spelling than any other style of registry in the English language. And they will so exasperatingly slop over into the poetics and try to do the sublime thing, with their expressions pointing heavenward, like the tail end of their demented pens. For instance:</p><p>Darling Betsie:</p><p>Among the holy Angles may you forever sore</p><p>When from this Worldly earth you part forever more. </p><p>Your sincere friend and vell visher.</p><p>NAPOLEON SNODGRASS.</p><p>Dear Maggy: Our friendship has budded</p><p>Temporarily on Earth. May it blossom out</p><p>Perminently in heaven. Yet While through</p><p>Lifes speer, we wonder here, remember Me.</p><p>Your loveing schoolmate.</p><p>JOB MELNOTTE.</p><p>Some of them remain on earth and talk glibly about birds, flowers, cottages, the wild sea waves and other human realities and possibilities, but the whole proposition is simply a willfully delusive, pleasant little humbug</p><p>FROZEN WATER PIPES.</p><p>The natural congealing of water pipes in Austin, Virginia, Gold Hill or any other leading points in Nevada constitutes a public calamity whenever and wherever it happens to occur. You get your water supply from the Sierra Nevada, and we get ours, here in Austin, from the bosom of the Toiyabe range. It matters not where the water comes from to fill the pipes which supply the town, however, so long as it does not freeze in the pipes. But it does. Men who go to church have felt compelled to swear about it, and even women have felt profane, although they said nothing - aloud - when they twisted the domestic faucet unavailingly. At times this Winter, Austin men have felt compelled to drink whisky, beer or similar beverages from lack of water. They really did seem to miss it.</p><p>MUMPS.</p><p>That peculiar disease, plurally designated as the mumps, continues to be peculiar to Austin, and the favorite complaint of her citizens. Its chief merit is its impartiality, afflicting the mature as well as the juvenile citizens. In fact the youngsters have come to regard it as a sort of maturing or finishing touch to manhood. The present Austin boy feels unhappy and discouraged unless he has had the mumps, or has promising hopes in that direction. He gazes admiringly upon the swollen joles of his old ""Pop,"" and exults in the prospect of soon catching the same or worse himself. He will consider his manhood properly evolved and secured only after he has had the mumps.</p><p>PLATFORM PLEDGES.</p><p>The Democratic wing of our legislating Salons at Carson is unfortunate in being arbitrarily hampered and instructed by platform resolutions, as well as by the general expression of their party, to assume and maintain the aggressive against all the railroads, whether such action shall be right or wrong. Hence their fecundity in the matter of hatching out bills to regulate and reform railroad matters. They have gained much new light on the subject since bringing their legislative brains to bear upon it, and know more about it now than those who concerted the platform resolutions for their guidance. They cannot very well see how they can overhaul and regulate the railroad situation to the most satisfactory advantage, but they feel obligated to make some sort of a showing in the way of railroad bills. The safest idea, under the circumstances, consists in presenting bills that are unconstitutional and therefore sure to be defeated, or which are essentially similar to others which have failed in previous Legislatures. Then they can very plausible, lay the defeat to the overpowering, mercenary Republican majority. The Republicans are not quite so badly hampered, being simply bound by their platform resolutions to demand from Congress wholesome and effective legislation on the subject, and also to adopt “such a course of enlightened legislation as will extend to railroad and all other corporations doing business in this State the same rights before the law as are accorded to individuals - no more and no less.” They are expected to regulate and equalize freights and fares on all railroads within this State, but they are also expected to study well the true interests of the State, as connected with railroad matters, and to take no action against railroad progress and development which shall work material injury to the future prosperity of the State and its people. As to platform pledges or dictation, it will be borne in mind that both parties in the Legislature are thus absolutely pledged to provide for a Constitutional Convention to revise the State Constitution, instead of trying to amend it themselves. They have the same right to ignore their platform pledges or instructions on the railroad as on the Constitution propositions. That's about the size of it, as viewed from a Reese River standpoint.</p><p>STARVING PIUTES.</p><p>It is gratifying to know that Government has ordered 5,000 worth of rations to be distributed to the Piutes of the northern border of this State, who were reported to be in a starving condition. So long as there is no ""reservation” jobbery and interested manipulation in the matter it is all right. There has been too much of that already, and in that direction. The Piutes in other sections of the State never complain of suffering and starvation. Here in the Reese River section, they flourish and multiply finely. There are some hundreds of them living in and about Austin, and they are all fat and comfortable. The squaws do a little washing and housework, and the men chop wood. In this way they manage to keep themselves well clothed and blanketed, and they can always pick up enough food among the whites. In fact, they all have their regular eating routes, so to speak, which they go over every day or at stated times. If they get nothing at one house they are likely to get something at the next. They never refuse to eat, if it is forty times a day, and what they cannot eat they take home to their campoodies on the hillsides. In the Fall they lay in plenty of pine nuts, and they also improve their time in that way during the fishing and hunting season, generally taking a trip down on the Humboldt about that time. Colonel Charley, with his wife and pretty black-eyed daughter Hattie, returned recently from a two-months’ visit to the Sink of the Humboldt. They came home in fine condition and brought several big sacks full of ducks and geese, all frozen solid. Charley was regarded as a bonanza man by his fellow-Piutes at first, but he has had bad luck at poker the last few days and has but few ducks and mud hens left. But he and his will never starve so long as there is fish, game and pine nuts in the country and second-hand grub in the kitchens and slop barrels of the whites.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE02.jpg,territorial
TE03,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday .... February 25, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Washington's Birthday -- A Forty-seven Pounder -- Explanatory Austin Cigarette Smokers -- Prospectors and Prospects About that Quail Proposition -- Melarkey -- Legislative Suggestions -- Religious Vice</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nevada, February 23, 1883.</p><p>Yesterday being Washington’s Birthday, and the weather particularly fine, of the Spring-like and bland order, this national holiday occasion was celebrated with more than usual interest. There was no public celebration, but the public generally celebrated. Bank, express, telegraph and Post office were closed, or held Sunday hours; there was ""no school,"" and young Austin was patriotically happy.  Numerous flags were displayed, and an infinite amount of fire-crackers and bombs were hilariously popped and banged. Even the Chinese joined quite extensively in this part of the demonstration, and had their big dragon flag flying together with the American flag. John rather enjoys our American holidays, although he considers that none of them come quite up to China New Year. No regular salutes were fired, although the Austin artillery caused small thunder to belch forth occasionally from the brazen throat of their big forty-seven-pounder -- I think it weighs about that.</p><p>Captain Jack, one of the most intelligent of Reese River Piutes, desired to have this holiday racket explained to him, and it was very lucidly done, after the following style, in his own language:</p><p>“Who you call um Washumtung?”</p><p>“Oh, he heapa big man, Jack, heapa big American chief.”</p><p>“Aller same Winnemucca?”</p><p>“Yes, Jack, only heapa more so. He heapa good chief. Allee’ Mericans heap likum. This he birthday; when he come little pappoose first time, you kno; savvy that, Jack.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Well, anyhow, Jack, Washington President; great General; heap pite; lickum dam British; fixum country bully,”</p><p>""Washumtun die?”</p><p>“Yes, heapa die, long time ago."" </p><p>""Chinaman killum?” </p><p>""No, no; dear me, no; he catchem sick - gone up - no come pappoose no more."" </p><p>""Ugh! You heapa likum - heapa shootum big gin - whatser matter now?"" </p><p>""Oh? get out, Jack; it's no use wasting time trying to explain things to a dam thick-headed Indian.”</p><p>Jack strode away, evidently puzzled as to whether his would-be informant was a fool or a crank.</p><p>JUVENILE SMOKERS.</p><p>The small boys of the Comstock, adepts as they are at learning anything that they should not, in the way of little or big vices, are not at all ahead of the small boys of the eastern part of the State in that respect. The juvenile boys of Austin are all veteran cigarette smokers. It is quite common to find small squads of them taking advantage of the pleasant weather to play hookey from school and get out behind an old cabin, or in some secluded place among the sagebrush, and every one of them puffing away at cigarettes, and playing cards like Piutes. It is not a growing vice, but one fully matured and in constant practice. Even the parents themselves are not really aware of the extent of this demoralizing vice among their little boys. Some of the most extensive tobacco consumers of the future are preparing to graduate from Austin.</p><p>OUTWARD MOVEMENTS.</p><p>The fine warm weather of the last few days suggesting the nearer proximity of Spring, fires up the sanguine souls of old prospectors, and they are talking of places away out in the hills here they think big things are to be found in the way of new ledges and mines of silver, gold or copper. And they are getting their old picks and things ready for a movement outward in some direction as soon as the season is fairly opened. Yankee Blade District, three or four miles north of here, is considered to contain just as good ledges as Austin. Some are being worked to very good advantage and profit, and more will be in due time. Bernice District, in Churchill county, is attracting considerable attention. It is a new mining locality, and some very good paying ledges are being developed there. The mines of here, although worked and mismanaged into obscurity years ago, are again coming to the front. The old Murphy mine, in Ophir canyon, was bought last year by a company of Denver capitalists, principal among whom is Jonas Seely, formerly of your city. It is now known as the Twin River mine. They have expended about $100,000 in new hoisting and milling arrangements and the practical development of the mine, and under the efficient superintendence of L. J. Hanchett it is now yielding finely, and furnishing regular shipments of silver bullion.</p><p>THE QUAIL PROPOSITION.</p><p>Colonel Charley, of the Piutes, has heard about that old quail proposition which has so long been going to the rounds, to the effect that somebody will wager any amount of coin that no man can eat one quail a day for thirty consecutive days. Charley stands ready to take that bet whenever anybody sees fit to put it to him in tangible shape. He is anxious for it, and only objects to being limited in the quail supply. As stated in my last week's letter, Charley recently returned from a hunting visit to the Sink of the Humboldt, where he lived on ducks, geese and mud hens for two months, and brought home six big sackful for home consumption. He will himself bet on eating two or three ducks every day for a year, and says he will match his big old ""sequaw,"" Susan, against anybody to eat anything in the shape of game, from a quail to a goose or a sandhill crane. Says he:</p><p>""Where's er man's got um quails? I bet um money I eatum dozen quails every day aller time. Whatser matter quails? Dam good grub, you bet. Tellum come see me. Show me quails.” And the old fellow smiled right jolly over the softness of the idea.</p><p>Seriously, though, that one quail a day proposition is simply a popular humbug. There are thousands of old California miners who never thought anything of eating from half a dozen to a dozen quail at a meal, and as often as they could get them - the oftener the better. The objectionable feature is the bet, with them, would be merely the aggravation of being allowed only one quail a day.</p><p>LEGISLATIVE.</p><p>We all naturally watch interestedly the movements and transactions of our toiling legislators at Carson. They have done very well thus far, and shown a very commendable degree of earnestness of purpose and practical legislative common sense. Wiser heads than even theirs have tackled the railroad problem and been floored, but they will not. They know how to get away with it. Putting off the Melarkey bill by the Assembly to be killed in the Senate, or vetoed by the Governor on the ground of special legislation against any one corporation, was a fine stroke of policy. The thread of the railroad discourse will be passed over to the next legislature, two years hence. If our present legislators conclude to obey and abide by their platform resolutions an instructions relative to providing for a Constitutional Convention, well and good, and perfectly consistent; and any amendment to the Constitution which they may see fit to suggest will be eminently in order and perfectly proper. Let them go through the compiled statutes carefully and weed out all the obsolete and dead ­ letter propositions therein contained, and especially sit down on the lottery law, the practical result of which has merely and solely been to confine the gambling wickedness of lotteries to church fairs and Sunday School socials. This assumption of morality on the stature book, which is openly violated, nullified and repudiated by our moral and religious teachings, is a scandalous inconsistency and an infernal humbug.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE03.jpg,territorial
TE04,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday, March 4, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>More Celestial Amenities -- Circulation -- Austin Architecture, Ancient Relics and Social Peculiarities -- A Very Steep Railroad -- Legislative Finale -- Well Done, Good and Faithful, Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 1, 1883.</p><p>During the last three or four days the Chinese have been holding some more high festivities, and what it is all about is not given for ordinary white barbarians to understand. Sam Gee says ""it's pooty big time"" in his country, “allee same Fourf July."" Anyhow, they have exploded numerous fire-crackers, bombs and all that sort of thing, and the noisy Celestial band has played itself into a complete state of exhaustion. It is evidently a sort of musical festival, or, perhaps, as Murphy suggests, they are practicing for St. Patrick's Day.</p><p>STILL CIRCULATING.</p><p>The opposition daily newspaper, the Democrat, still continues to exist and circulate. Austin never was in condition to support two dailies before, and is not now. John Booth, of the Reveille, always apologized for not running a larger paper, by saying that it was of no use trying to run a forty-column paper in a twenty column town; yet, here we have two twenty column papers running in full blast. The chances for profits on either paper, are, however, correspondingly small. Some people thought the Democrat would stop circulating directly after the close of the late political campaign, but it still circulates. Perhaps, its occasionally changing proprietors manage to financially make both ends meet, and keep it circulating as the crane did the eel. It remains for time to decide whether Austin can support two papers, or that it shall simply result in the survival of the fittest.</p><p>AUSTIN ARCHITECTURE</p><p>Austin being the oldest town in Eastern Nevada, and never having been thoroughly swept by an extensive or obliterating conflagration, the general architectural style of the houses partakes considerably of the primeval and original. There are many very neat and commodious residences, one hotel, three churches, the County Court-house and the Masonic and Odd Fellows' Hall building, a two story brick; but the generality of the houses are small but comfortable. This never was a good country for lumber, therefore the first settlers who came with rush consequent upon the discovery of the rich silver mines here built their houses of adobe, brick or stone, and they made them only large enough to live in, for building material was scarce and labor dear. These little seven-by-nine dwellings are to be found throughout the town, and are yet among the most substantial and comfortable. They are considerably improved and added to, however, each forming a nucleus for multiplication or many additions. Whenever a new child was added to the family a new room was built on to the side or rear of the house, and the present size or census of the oldest families are thus easily computed by counting the number of rooms or additions to the house. The main or original house being small, and not lofty, these wing additions have their roofs pretty flat, therefore low ceilings predominate, and most of the houses have a rambling, depressed, spread out appearance - like an ambitious old hen trying to set on an unusual number of eggs. Some of the most interesting of these original houses are the little ""stockade"" cabins. These were built of small logs or poles, stuck on end, with the interstices chinked or plastered up with mud. The roofs were covered with sagebrush and mud, and some so remain, although most of them have been reroofed in a more acceptable and Christian-like style. These relics of the old times are interesting to contemplate. But you cannot drive a nail into those old logs or the lumber made from them anymore than into an anvil or millstone. They are of the nut pine or cedar growth of the early days, and are now seasoned as hard as a miserly bonanza man's heart.</p><p>AUSTIN SOCIETY.</p><p>The citizens of Austin are generally of a friendly, social nature. Everybody minds his own business, principally, and as much of his neighbor's as he sees fit, and there is very little fighting or quarreling, all being disposed to be orderly and law-abiding. A little over a year ago one man shot and killed another in the bar-room of the hotel. Before morning his fellow-citizens smashed into the jail and hanged him by the neck in the front doorway of the Court-house. The Sheriff was thus saved trouble, and the county some expense, and even the victim said he supposed it was all right. There has been no trouble since. The county officers are the flush men, financially, but they are not selfish. They lend their salaries to whoever asks them, and when they want money they borrow some. The ladies dress elegantly, some of the poorest, homeliest and most illiterate wearing the costliest goods. Generally speaking, however, they average and compare very well with other communities, in the way of good looks, social agreeableness and practical common sense. The young ladies are all good looking, without any exception.</p><p>A STEEP RAILROAD.</p><p>The chances are that we have the steepest plain railroad in the world here in Austin - that is to say, the steepest in practical daily use. From the terminal depot of the Nevada Central Railroad, at the mouth of the Canyon, about half a mile below town, it winds around and up the grade, passing directly up through the center of the main street to the Manhattan mill, at the upper end of the town, a distance of about two miles. It is a narrow-gauge, and the grade or ascent is one foot in eight - over 600 feet to the mile. This is almost like passing up Main street, Gold Hill. The grade of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, from Carson river to the Comstock, is 116 feet to the mile. That of the southern Pacific, at Tehachapi, where the recent terrible disaster occurred, is 105 feet to the mile. A small but very powerful dummy locomotive, weighing 33,000 pounds does all the transportation work over our street railroad, hauling two flat cars, loaded with six cords each of heavy nut pine, or two box cars, loaded with general merchandise, at a time in nice weather like this. In Winter, however, when the track is slippery, one car load at a time is enough for it. This locomotive is a very neat bit of machinery, enclosed by a wooden covering or cab, upon each side of which is printed in big letters its name, “Mules’ Relief."" And this is a very appropriate name, too, for eight mules used to have a very tough, wearisome pull to navigate a single car load up from the depot aforesaid before this lively, unflinching and never-tiring little motor came to their relief.</p><p>HARMLESS.</p><p>It is pleasing to know that our sapient legislator at Carson have concluded their labors and gone home. And it is more leasing to know that they did so little harm during their allotted term of service in behalf of the State and their fellow citizens. There were some very good leading men among them, men of ral [sic] natural talent and legislative ability. In fact as a whole they were better than the average Nevada Legislature. For this reason it was that they did so little harm, and in reality some real practical good. Especially were they harmless in the matter of railroad legislation, just as practical observer of the situation expected of them. The first part of the session they did little practical work, but, like all preceding Legislatures merely passed away the time, getting ready to do something. The result was a press of work and delayed bills at the latter end. All the bills they had on hand when they got through they can pass over to their successors, the Legislature of two years hence, giving that body something good to start in on. Especially in the way of railroad bills.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE04.jpg,territorial
TE05,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday .... March 11, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Scarecrow Wiggins – Ruby Silver and Manhattan Bullion – Long Credits and Dull Times – Rich Rock Reese River Pioneers – Jim Sloggers Strikes It – Our Returned Legislators – Carson Reminiscences</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 9, 1883.</p><p>And now here it is the morning of the day when Wiggins' big storm was to break loose and devastate the whole country with sweeping tornadoes, cloud-burstings of rain, fierce thunder and wild leaping electricity. Yet the predicted visitation cometh not, and the Spring-like weather continues as a reproving mockery to the ambitious prophet. But he gives until the 13th, next Tuesday, for his calamitous prediction to come to pass. The telegraph says that he has succeeded in frightening the Down-East coasters, and not a Marblehead or Gloucester fisherman will venture out of port until the prescribed limit of time for the Wiggins trouble is past. In the next three or four days the codfish and the halibut will roam unmolested amid the dark rocky recesses of the ocean bed, with no calamitous or clam-baited hooks to tempt or make them afraid. And Wiggins himself, having recklessly staked his reputation as a prophet on this unpleasant prediction is no doubt anxiously watching the skies and the weather signs in ardently hopeful expectation. He wouldn't mind being blown a mile or two, struck by lightning and crippled for life if his dire prognostication would only come true, and vidicate [sic] and establish him as a true prophet. But the chances are that he will not have the supreme, selfish satisfaction of saying “I told you so,"" but will be ignominiously consigned to oblivion as a ridiculous failure, like old Mother Shipton and similar prophetic frauds of times past. Those Down-East fishermen should take him out and throw him overboard, like Jonah, as feed for some dyspeptic whale. Wiggins' failure as a prophet may be attributed principally to the weather. Meanwhile Lydia Pinkham continues to placidly smile through the newspapers, and the old world rotates regularly as usual.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>The mill of the Manhattan Company continues grinding right straight along, and grinds exceedingly fine, its present run, which commenced on the 30th of October last, being one of the longest and most lucrative it has yet experienced. About every other day it sends forth its regular shipment of silver bullion - ten bars, worth $1,000, or more, each. The average of the ore crushed at the previous run of the mill, last Summer, yielded an average $350 to the ton. The ore of the present run is not quite as rich, but there is more of it, and mines showing and developing better and more extensively than was anticipated. The monthly pay-roll of the company is about $23,000, employing many miners at the regular rate - $4 per day - and the tributers are generally doing well. The mining and milling operations and other business matters of the Manhattan Company are exceedingly well managed and judiciously conducted in every respect. Notwithstanding all this apparent prosperity, however, there is much grumbling about hard times. This complaint comes principally from the business men. They openly declare that although their customers have plenty of work at good pay, they do not come forward and square up their accounts as they should. The tributers, especially, they say, run long credits and big bills, and cannot always be depended upon to cash up. When they are in bad luck, they naturally are not expected to pay. Meanwhile, good paying customers have to make up for the poor ones, otherwise the storekeepers would soon necessarily be bankrupt. This idea or principle is not new, however, here or even on the Comstock.</p><p>RICH ROCK.</p><p>The veins being only a few inches wide or thick, it does not pay to extract or work any low grade ore, therefore rock that yields $300 or $350 per ton under the stamps is about on a par with $30 or $40 ore on the Comstock. Some of this ore, however, runs as high as $1,000 or $2,000 and over to the ton. Nobody cares to fool away time getting out $100 ore; and base metal ores are carefully left for future reference or posterity. The general character of the ore worked is of the ruby or antimonial silver variety, containing little or no gold, and some specimens of it, to be seen in the numerous mineral cabinets about Austin, are the most beautiful imaginable; in fact not to be excelled, or perhaps equaled, on the American continent.</p><p>REESE RIVER PIONEERS.</p><p>Many of the original locators and developers of the mines are here, yet, and many of them will die and be buried here. Your genuine Reese River pioneer is decidedly a peculiar character. He was a pioneer of California as well, therefore was among the first to join in the rush to “Washoe"" and soon after to Reese River. He never was able to shake off his old California miner style, and would rather live in a cabin and work at “chloriding” or “tributing"" for himself, at merely living rations than to work for anybody else for good, regular wages. Therefore it is that he is found working “on tribute” or contract in these mines to-day, for of course he sold out his old locations or was frozen out of them long ago. He still goes out in the hills prospecting occasionally, but the whole country has been so closely scoured over and investigated that his new discoveries are exceedingly rare. Old Jim Sloggers, who is a standard member of the Society of Reese River Pioneers, and who declares that he was with old Reese himself when he discovered Reese river, is the most inveterate of them all. Whisky could not kill him, but has only preserved him, as it were, and he frequently swears that when he dies the worms in the little graveyard below town will go on a three months' Jamboree. The fine, Spring-like weather of the last few days stirred up the old fellow's ambition and he went prospecting over about Yankee Blade. Yesterday he came home and got drunk.</p><p>""Struck it again!"" roared he as he tacked ship and stood his course up street, stopping every few rods to shake hands with sympathizing friends, and tell them about it. “Struck bulliest kind o‘ chloride, richer'n Limburger a foot thick, betcher ribs."" </p><p>“Glad to hear it, Jim, and now see that you hold on to a good thing for once in the way, and don't let anybody euchre or freeze you out of it.”</p><p>“Ha, Ha! Freeze me out, hey? Git ahead of old Jim Sloggers some more, will they? Not much. Got ‘em this time. Located the whole dam racket myself, and goin’ ter work it myself. Hain’t got no thievin’ partners this time, and don't want none. I'm the only damsonova ---- in it.”</p><p>Then the old boy went ship, and beat to windward for his little cabin on the hillside, chuckling occasionally as he felicitated himself on that last proposition.</p><p>Colonel Dave Buel was among the first of the Reese River pioneers. He laid out the townsite and built the first mill. The town was named after his partner, Alvah C. Austin, a native of Plymouth, Massachusetts, who was here with him, but who is now a partner in the Miners' Foundry, San Francisco, and resident of that city. By the way, Jack Williams, the famous desperado, so well remembered in the early days of the Comstock, and who was assassinated one evening in Pat Lynch's saloon, on B street, as a so from Plymouth, Massachusetts.</p><p>SIMMERING.</p><p>Our returned legislators from Carson have been very busy the last two or three days standing the congratulations of their numerous friends, and are gradually simmering down to private life once more. They speak well of Carson, and say they were well treated there and allowed to get away with their trunks. The only thing that worried them, in the way of legislation, was the railroad proposition, and that they found worse to solve than the grindstone problems in the ENTERPRISE.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE05.jpg,territorial
TE06,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday .... March 18. 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>St. Patrick -- Celestial fenians -- Piute Weather Signs -- A Kerosene Comet -- Liberal Dicks --Literary Notes --A Lively Locality -- Bushels of Squelched Talent -- Hidden Lights of Genius</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 16, 1883.</p><p>The grand festive event now thrilling Austin society to its very foundations is the St. Patrick's ball which culminates and transpires to-night at International Hall. It is Lent, but the Church has granted a special disposition; all outsiders of any note or social capability will unite in jolly celebration of the good St. Patrick and his annual day, by dancing all night at the ball. Poetic tradition has it that –</p><p>St. Patrick was a jintleman,</p><p>And born of daycint people.</p><p>Be that as it may, he was a good man and did a vast amount of good in his day and generation, besides running all the hoptoads and wriggling snakes out of Ireland. It may be that the frequent fire-cracker fusilades and inharmonious band demonstrations of the heathen Chinese, recently, have not been preparatory practicing for the celebration, but they have been making some new flags, which they displayed a day or two since for the first time floating from the flagstaff of their little redfaced Masonic Temple. One was a large pointed red flag, with a white serrated border, and covered with big white polka dots, on each of which was inscribed a Chinese character, looking like the man in the moon. Above this was a square banner covered with similar spots and characters. This banner was bright green. Can it be that they have Fenimans among them? If they hoist that flag on St. Patrick's Day, the question may be considered settled.</p><p>WEATHER SIGNS.</p><p>An infallible indication of the return of Spring is the Piute warriors about town all wearing linen dusters. When Winter squarely sets in, they always carefully lay aside the duster, of which they are so proud, and wear a blanket. It is literally a cold day when the dusky lord of the sagebrush has to do this. Now he dresses more stylish than his pale-faced fellow-citizen, his squaw ambitiously keeping him well supplied with clean dusters. From now on, no matter what the weather may be, dusters have to go with him, the only difference being that a cold snap induces him to wear more of them at a time. Anyhow, he knows as much about future extraordinary weather possibilities as Wiggins, the famous yet unreliable prophet, who only succeeded in raising a storm about his own ears.</p><p>A LIVELY SENSATION</p><p>Was created and experienced the other evening by a well known and popular gentleman, Alex Burchfield, employed at one of the hoisting works of the Manhattan Company. He had occasion to replenish the kerosene filling of one of the lamps, and after his usual style proceeded to do so while it was lighted. The can suddenly exploded with a loud report, covering him with liquid fire from head to foot. Alex is a man prompt to act in cases of emergency, so without waiting to be extinguished, he distinguished himself by one of the longest flying leaps on record, rushing like a blazing comet through the air and plunging head-first straight into a big tank of cold water, several yards distant. He came up cool and smiling, shook himself and went home. He dresses in cotton-batting, principally, at present, and has no desire to fill lamps except through fifty feet of garden hose.</p><p>STUNNING BENEVOLENCE.</p><p>Our enterprising citizens never do anything by halves, and when it comes to public benevolence they go the whole pig, tail and all, if they take the notion. Evening before last there was a hilariously lively runaway right in the heart of town. The buggy was destroyed, but neither of the lady occupants was hurt in the least, and the horses went home to the livery stable. As soon as the exciting story got around, and Colonel Jinks heard the circumstances, he gallantly remarked: ""I don't believe I will allow these ladies to pay for that buggy. I’ll do it myself."" ""Not much, old pard,"" said Uncle Dick, ""I'm going in for $300 of it myself."" About a dozen others insisted on footing the whole loss out of their own individual pockets, and there came near being a general rush for the stable. Finally Major Boggs fixed the thing by heading a subscription paper with $250 with the privilege of doubling. In less than two hours over $10,000 was subscribed. When the fortunate stable keeper gets all that money he will be able to retire from business and settle at Tombstone.</p><p>LITERARY.</p><p>The people of Austin are considerably of the literary order. They read a good many books, and especially all the leading papers of the day, including, of course, the Enterprise, which has a healthy list of subscribers, and is read by all the principal and best-informed citizens. They allow two daily papers to be printed here, and the San Francisco papers also are well patronized. By the way, I notice that the San Francisco Weekly Call is publishing a California story, written by Jules Verne, entitled ""Phina Island."" Thus far it is a totally un-Californian yarn, both in the names of the principal personages and the dialogue of the narrative, to say nothing of the general construction of the story. The charm and true merit of Verne's most famous stories has been their plausibility, on the principle that a lie well told is as good as the truth."" This yarn, however, is neither plausible nor sensible, and abounds in Munchausen exaggerations bordering upon the burlesque.</p><p>A BUSY SPOT.</p><p>One of the busiest localities in the State of Nevada at the present time is comprised within the active working limits of the mines of the Manhattan Company, on Lander Hill, at the upper end of this town. A few hundred yards is the extent, but within that space half a dozen sets or plants of well erected and established hoisting works, like those of the Comstock, are in full and effective operation, bringing to daylight the very rich ores from the bowels of the big hill. The ore belt lies along the side of this hill, just about as the Comstock does along the side of Mount Davidson, only Lander Hill is not so steep. This busy spot of which I speak has been busy for the last twenty years, and will by busy for the next twenty years, for the ore holds out in both richness and quantity as depth is attained, and in fact there is more in sight to-day than there has been for years. The ore veins are small, but they seem to have exceedingly long and lucrative roots.</p><p>SUPPRESSED TALENT.</p><p>A friend who was at Carson during the recent session of the Legislature says he never saw so much talent run to waste. At the hotel where he stopped, the servants complained of the harassing annoyance they encountered in trying to avoid interrupting members of the Assembly or the Senate when they were in their rooms practicing the speeches which they expected to deliver next day, yet he was astonished to see how few of those speeches were ever delivered. Many a time he anxiously watched some member whom he knew was loaded with a mighty speech he proposed to deliver on some certain question, and yet that speech never was delivered from the intellectual womb where it was conceived. Often he watched the eager aspiring eye and moving lip, and the ardent wish to rise and forensically shine, and as often saw the same crowded back or nipped in the bud by adverse action, lack of opportunity, self-discouragement or demoralized confidence. Let those victims of adverse fate, however, remember Daniel Webster, and they may even surpass him yet some day.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE06.jpg,territorial
TE07,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….March 25, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Snide Prophecies—Street Grass—Silver Wealth—Two Bits a Week— Departing Friends—Austin —The Widow McWinzle and her Rhyming Achievements—Thaddeus of Washoe—Smallpox Reflections and Deductions.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 23, 1883.</p><p>Professor Snider, our local astronomic weather sharp, who predicted that March would come in like a lamb, remain lamb-like all through, and go out the same way, is very likely to make a fine success of it. He certainly has beaten Wiggins badly on the proposition. As to that matter he used to go to school with Wiggins and declares him to be a fraud of the most exasperating kind, whom it is always safe to copper. Snider says the Winter is not over yet, however, but predicts both snow and rain, next month—principally snow. There will also be wind, but no Wiggins’ tornadoes. Unless there is considerable rain or snow pretty soon, the crops of grain, hay and everything else throughout the farming sections of Eastern Nevada will be short—in fact almost a failure. Some of the newspapers recently have been stating that grass is growing in the streets of Eureka. Now, as nothing but sagebrush ever grew there before, this may be considered an encouraging circumstance to farmers and cattle men. If Eureka will produce a good crop of grass, the rest of the country is safe for bountiful crops of all kinds. Should the low price of lead and the heavy discount on silver continue Eureka might find it good policy to rest her mines for a season, and advantageously ""go to grass.""</p><p>THE BULLION HARVEST</p><p>Of the Manhattan mill still continues uninterruptedly. Every other day a down train on the railroad, direct from the mill, brings ten bars of silver bullion, worth $1,000 each, to the express office for shipment to San Francisco. It is quite amusing, even to old residents, to see the Piute warriors in their fine linen dusters rush forward, when the cars stop in the middle of the street and eagerly pick up those heavy white bars of silver and pack them into the express office. They have a very good idea regarding the amount of half dollars each bar can be coined into, and their consequent utility in an extensive game of poker. Some of these Piutes have thus handled more silver than nine-tenths of the whites in America ever saw. And it is quite refreshing to note the complacent smiles on their ruddy countenances when they retire to the sidewalk as the train passes on. Give them a whole carload of bullion apiece and they would feel no richer nor enjoy life any better. Meanwhile, all the little narrow-gauge ledges or veins of the Austin ore belt continue their steady output of rich ore, bidding fair to keep the mill running steadily for a month or two yet.</p><p>A NOTABLE REDUCTION.</p><p>And now the little old Reese River Reveille, which ranks next to the ENTERPRISE in age among the papers of this State, announces that its subscription price will be reduced to two bits a week, commencing with next Monday. It has maintained its old price, four bits a week, longer than any other well-conducted daily, but it now yields to competition and the requirements of the times. If uncompromising hard work and indomitable John Booth perseverance amount to anything in public estimation, the Reveille must continue to prosper indefinitely.</p><p>DEPARTING FRIENDS.</p><p>Rev. R. S. Eastman, who for the last three years has been pastor of the Episcopal Church in this town, having resigned, will preach his last sermon here next Sunday (Easter), and on Monday morning will depart with his wife and child for the East. He has accepted a call to assume pastoral charge of the Episcopal Church in Laport, Indiana, and, making that place their future residence, they may find a more agreeable position and surroundings nearer the old home and friends of their youth. But they will meet with no truer or more appreciative friends than they leave both here and on the Comstock, all of whom will most cordially join in wishing Mr. Eastman and his estimable wife a full measure of happiness and genuine prosperity.</p><p>AUSTIN AMENITIES.</p><p>As was anticipated, the recent St. Patrick’s ball was the most popular and well-attended affair of the kind ever given in Austin. Everybody went, and International Hall was the most densely crowded place in Eastern Nevada. It was not until about 5 o’clock next morning that the festive assemblage got sufficiently thinned out to allow of free and comfortable dancing. A comic operetta, with an orchestra of ten pieces, all local talent, is the next thing on the docket, and the Odd Fellows propose giving a ball shortly. Speaking about local talent, there is a concentration of it in Austin, and of all varieties—base-ball players, musicians, singers, theatrical actors and all that sort of thing. There are no liars here, however, since Fred Hart left.</p><p>THE POETIC WIDOW.</p><p>Our mutual friend Spykens has ""made a mash,"" to use the language of the worldly. He incidentally became acquainted with the Widow McWinzle at a church social last Fall.  She has now come to the conclusion that he is her natural affinity, and wants him for her fourth husband. Her strong suit is poetry, or, as she expresses it, ""human, esthetic rhyme; the sweet, responsive echo of soul to soul.""</p><p>""Dear Mr. Spyens,"" sighed the widow the other evening, puckering her mouth down to the size of a shirt button-hole, as it were, ""you have lived and loved. The mellifluous profundity of your sympathetic soul has always required that you should.""</p><p>""Ah, yes, Mrs. McWinzle, you bet, I—""</p><p>""Call me Hitty, dear; my name is Mehitable, and those most endeared to me always call me Hitty.""</p><p>""All right; Hitty goes.""</p><p>""Well, as I was about remarking, my nature was aboriginally poetic; away up among the embrasured clouds of heaven’s sublimated artillery. My first husband was a dear, genial spirit, attuned to poetic harmony, but nothing could rhyme with his name. It was Tulkington. I used to weave it into poetic verse by abbreviating it to Tulky, but even then it never would make a smooth rhyme with any other word. Two short years he loved and languished, and then sank to eternal rest as softly as though the springs of his couch had been the Springs of Parnassus.""</p><p>""Beautiful! Beautiful"" exclaimed Spykens, ""what a rattling good obituary you must have written for him!""</p><p>""Ah, me,"" sighed the widow, ""I tried over a year to write seven verses suitable, and perhaps might have succeeded had I not been wooed and won by Jason Babcock. My new married life was bright and hopeful till I tried to merge it into poesy. The culmination came when I composed twenty-seven verses, each one rhyming his name, the best of which were mason, basin, face-on. Then he closed the doors of his heart, took his overcoat and valise and bade me farewell forever. I never saw or heard of him more.""</p><p>""What a miserable, narrow-gauge, unappreciative wretch he must have been.""</p><p>The widow gave a responsive roll of her dark gray eyes toward the sympathetic Spykens, as she continued:</p><p>""Yes, the rythmatic music of poetry did not abound in his worldly soul, and my own longing heart almost perished before I procured a divorce on the ground of desertion. Then I married my old friend and schoolmate, Timothy McWinzle. He had a soul full of sympathy, and when he realized how my poetic nature was crushed by the very idea of making rhymes of his name, or any part of it, he earnestly, yet rashly, attempted it himself. For days and weeks he wrote and went about the house muttering to himself binzle, crinzle, dinzle,finzle, ginzle, hinzle, and his last words, as he died in the insane asylum, were minzle, pinzle, stinzle, zinzle.""</p><p>""How dramatically sad,"" moaned Spykens, as he reflected upon the rhyming possibilities and calamities of his own name.</p><p>""Did you ever read Thaddeus of Washoe?"" asked she, beaming her loving eyes, full of literary intelligence, full upon him as she gently laid her hand on his coat-sleeve.</p><p>Spykens owned up that he hadn’t, and tore himself away from her sweet presence, pleading pressing business engagements. The widow has money in bank, and a whole pile of stocks, and is looked upon as a desirable matrimonial investment, but when Spykens reflects, musingly, upon the sad fate of those three husbands, two killed and one driven away by her infernal poetry, assisted materially, no doubt, by Her large, cold, clammy feet, he concludes to remain single.</p><p>SMALLPOX.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the mumps everybody has taken cold, and there is more influenzial coughing and sneezing going on in Austin than anywhere. The meanest man hasn’t got it yet, but he will, because there is plenty and he can get it for nothing. Smallpox never thinks it worthwhile to come here and is not liable to, for various reasons. That objectionable disease favors more populous and eligible localities. I see by the papers that they have it over in Nevada City, California. I also notice that the local papers eagerly assert that there is no occasion for any scare on the part of the timid public; that the disease cannot spread, etc. But they record that it does spread, however, at a very lively rate; that the public schools close in consequence; the city officials are taking active measures to corral and squelch the dread malady, and a general scare prevails in spite of all the admonitions to the contrary. Now, why not come out in honest, square recognition of the much and justly-dreaded disease and treat it accordingly? Call it smallpox and treat it as such. Alarm everybody and put them on their guard. The newspaper editors should be among the first to catch the disease, in order that they might write more judiciously and intelligently regarding it.</p><p>ALF.

TE08,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….April 1, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Lack of Moisture—Beef Realities and Possibilities—About the Flood—Some Hailstones—Bonanza Tributers—Going to See the Old Folks at Home—Ducks and Geese—Poetic Delights and Capabilities.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 30, 1883.</p><p>The inclination of the weather to be stormy during the last three or four days has been very encouraging to the hopes of most everybody, the ranchers especially. Only about enough of hail, snow or rain, however, has fallen to moisten the surface and law the dust. Two inches of snow fell yesterday morning, and in the evening we had a very eligible hail squall. Eastern Nevada stands sadly in need of a goodly amount of snow, rain, or something of the sort at this present time. Even a cloudburst would be welcome. This section has not been thoroughly saturated with heavenly moisture for several years, or since 1874. In October of that year there was an overplus of water, so far as Austin was concerned, a fearful cloudburst occurring on the 16th, which created a disastrous flood. A huge river suddenly generated and turned itself loose down Main street, sweeping everything before it. The Postoffice, Reveille office and other buildings were totally demolished, including their contents. Awnings, porches, sidewalks and all that sort of thing went down stream, and one man was drowned. For awhile even the stoutest old sinners felt paralyzed, and would not have been surprised  in the least had the last vestige of Austin been washed down into the graveyard at the mouth of the canyon.</p><p>THE FLOOD</p><p>Has ever since been spoken of as a stated era in the history of Austin, and all the old pioneers date previous or subsequent events accordingly. Children’s ages are reckoned from it, as being before or after the flood, and all other current events, historical, financial, political or otherwise are dated from that same memorable standpoint. The old pioneer stiffs who can’t die are eternally giving all newcomers powerfully exaggerated reminiscences of that remarkable flood, and prognosticating a recurrence of the same liquid calamity, evidently standing more in fear of water than of whisky. In fact there seems to be a sort of antediluvian aristocracy grown out of that watery epoch, all who have come here since the flood being looked upon as emigrants, so to speak. Old Jim Sloggins, who is a prominent representative member of the Society of Reese River Pioneers, gives more of the details of that flood than anybody, and is willing to swear to all he tells. He says it came down street with a breast twenty feet high, of quartz wagons, mules, cordwood, houses and other debris, rolling, foaming and plunging. And as for the storm itself, “it was like every drop of rain was a continuous stream from a fire injun, and all the side hills simply slopped whole sheets of water down into the ravine.” Day before yesterday a hail squall passed over here which rattled down some coarse hailstones about the size of marbles or walnuts, but Jim said they were nothing but mustard seed in comparison with the hail that fell “at the time of the flood. Them hailstones,” says Jim, “was bigger’n baby’s heads; they was even too big even for the Piutes to play base ball with next day.” Speaking about</p><p>PIONEERS,</p><p>The pioneers of Reese River and Austin were from California and the Comstock. Many of them are here yet, and they still form a leading influential element in the population. The old time energy which adventured them here, so to speak, still remains with them, and they continue making their mark. Among the miners swinging their picks down in the small, but wonderfully rich veins of this silver ore belt, are numerous old Comstock miners, who rank among the best, as they naturally should.</p><p>BONANZA KINGS.</p><p>Bonanzas are not so large in these mines as they are in the Comstock, but they are more frequent, and, owing to the system of working “on tribute,” or by contract, the miners frequently find themselves bonanza men, which they could not be on the Comstock, unless they struck it in stocks instead of through legitimate mining. A “pitch” pocket strike of rich ore, two or three feet wide, means something in these mines, and the tributers get well rewarded occasionally for their long-continued, patient hard work exploring and developing. The result, quite frequently, is shown in some of the boys taking a trip home to the “old country.” Dick Mitchell, brother to Johnny Mitchell, who used to be foreman of the Justice mine, has been working for the last two or three years in the Plymouth shaft of the Manhattan Company, with two or three other lessees, or tributers. They did very well at the previous run of the mill, nearly a year ago, and one of the boys went back to see the old folks in England. During the present run of the mill they have done still better, and Dick proposes taking trip with his little family to visit relatives in the old home of his birth. Redruth parish, Cornwall. He expects to start about the 10th of next month, and don’t know whether he will come back or hot. But he will.</p><p>ABOUT BEEF.</p><p>Eastern Nevada is famous for the production of choice beef for the markets of the Comstock section, as well as of California and eastward. We ship our best beef, and use the rest in the way of home consumption. That’s business, of course, yet let it not be understood that we do not have a few choice steaks and cuts of the very best ourselves, while also assisting in working up or eating up the poorer stock. We have six butcher shops, employing about twenty men, ten horses and half a dozen carts, to slaughter and distribute the beef to some 2,500 customers, who are supposed to chew or otherwise consume this beef. Every shop makes a good showing of beef and each and every one is provided with a good sausage-chopping machine, which is kept busily employed. There is probably more tough beef chewed, naturally or artificially, in Eastern Nevada than anywhere else on the Pacific Coast. If this were not thus, how could six butcher shops be supported in a little place like Austin?</p><p>A HUNTER’S PARADISE.</p><p>Nimrod is mentioned as a mighty hunter, among the ancient sports, and no doubt he did very well in his way, and in his day and generation, but he would be considered rather tame and commonplace among the hunters of this section, so far as duck or goose shooting is concerned. J. A. Wright, one of Austin’s best shotgun manipulators, went down to the Humboldt river the other day, seeking what birds he might slaughter before the game law should prevent him. He went to one of his favorite haunts, some sixteen miles above Battle Mountain, and for three days luxuriated among a perfect affluence of fat ducks and geese, and armies of sandhill cranes, with necks and legs as long as fence rails. He was joined at Battle Mountain by Dunn, Sprigg and other congenial sports, and they killed about a car-load of game. They had a boat, and sailed, waded and swam, as they saw fit. Wright says they were fairly overrun with game, and merely shot all they wanted. He thinks no other place in the world can equal it.</p><p>THE WIDOW AGAIN.</p><p>Spykens is apparently doomed, so far as the widow McWinzle is able to doom him. She will not leave the poor fellow alone, but now insists that he must have an autograph album, in order that she may fill it with autographic poetry. She has the following delicious morsel toSpykens as a starter for the album he was going to set up for himself:</p><p>May your manhood’s voyage be bright,</p><p>And ever with fair wind said</p><p>O’er seas of blue ethereal light,</p><p>Is the hope of</p><p>HITTY McWINZLE.</p><p>Spykens is of a very romantic, musical disposition, and has employed his surplus talent and time “picking dump” near the Paxton incline for the last year or two, but this poetry business of the widow makes him nervous. He thinks he shall have to go prospecting somewhere as soon as the weather gets warmer.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.  </p>",public://territorial/TE08.jpg,territorial
TE09,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….April 8, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Bullion Value of Snow—Barley and Beef Prospects—That Nevada Cadetship—An Austin Boy—Public School Matters—Pacific Coast Exposition—Spyken’s Big Luck—A Second John Mackay—How the Wicked Flourish Sometimes—Baseball Boomers.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., April 6, 1883.</p><p>The storms of the last few days have been of incalculable benefit to this section, and the fall of snow, although not very heavy, was worth its weight in bullion. It still whitens the face of the country, and the thirsty earth greedily absorbs it as it melts. And the white-peaked summits of the mountain ranges, gleaming in shrouded sullenness against the still threatening sky, betoken a goodly reserve of snow, preserved there for future reference. There had been so little snow up to the 1st of the present month that the grain crops bade fair to be a complete failure, and although agreeably favored at present, unless more snow or rain supplements what has fallen already, the crops are not secured against failure by any means. Cattle will get along well, with plenty of grazing and water, and in fact horses, cattle and sheep are in better condition now than they have been at a corresponding stage of the season for years. The prospects for tender mutton chops and less durable beef steaks are very encouraging.</p><p>THE NEW CADETSHIP.</p><p>Regarding the new cadet allotted to this State at the West Point Military School, it is not pleasing to hear that Congressman Cassidy has decided to appoint an eligible young man to the position, even though he be from Eastern Nevada. Availing himself of his prerogative to do so cannot give as general satisfaction as though he were to institute a competitive examination and allow the smart boys of all parts of the State to contend for the coveted position on equal terms. It will be borne in mind that the young aspirants sent from Nevada to the military and naval schools of the Government in times past, have not all turned out so well as expected, by any means, although some have well improved the golden opportunity, aided by their own natural talents and ability, and are to-day a credit and honor to the State. None but the fittest and best should be selected, and our worthy Congressman should not rely altogether upon his own judgment in this important matter. There are a goodly number of eligible young men in the western part of the State as well as in Eureka and elsewhere, and we can present at least one here in Austin. The friends of Robert Eames respectfully submit him as a candidate for the proposed honor. He is a worthy young man, of good family, well qualified morally, intellectually and physically, and in a competitive examination would stand more than an average show for success.</p><p>THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS</p><p>Of Lander county are in a very flourishing condition, and are well supported financially, all having a surplus of funds in their treasuries. Here in Austin about 300 scholars are in regular attendance. Professor C. M. Ritter is Principal, and under his able and efficient management the school will bear comparison with the best in the State. Young Eames, referred to above as candidate for West Point honors and privileges, is one of his pupils, and will graduate at the close of the present term. A pert little nine-year-old miss, in one of the school departments, the other evening, remarked to her teacher: “Oh, dear; I’ve missed in my written spelling two days in succession. I do hope I shall be perfect to-day; I’ve been altogether too two lately.”</p><p>PACIFIC COAST EXPOSITION.</p><p>The suggestion of the San Francisco Daily Report to make the grand Triennial Convocation of the Knights Templar at San Francisco next August the occasion of an Exposition of Minerals of the Pacific Coast is not a bad one, by any means. Thousands of Knights and their friends from all parts of the nation will be present, and the suggested Exposition would be eminently appropriate and form one of the most important and interesting attractions of the occasion. The report suggests that the State Mining Bureau, which now has the finest collection of ores and minerals in the United State, be made the nucleus of the proposed Exposition. California took no part in the Denver Exposition last year, and Nevada, although represented very richly there, hardly did justice to herself. This exhibit being right at home, both States would naturally take an extraordinary interest in it, and satisfactorily demonstrate their ability to show the grandest, richest and most varied and interesting collection of ores and minerals ever seen in the United States or the world. Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Oregon and Washington Territory could materially contribute, even at short notice; but even a grand showing of California and Nevada mineral products alone would be a rich and magnificent affair, redounding to the credit and material advantage of both. This Pacific Coast Mineral Exhibition idea should not be lost sight of, but vigorously acted upon, promptly and forthwith.</p><p>A WINDFALL.</p><p>Our mutual friend, Spykens, has struck it at last. He has just received a Down East newspaper, which brings the unexpected, yet agreeable information that he is a millionaire, or a high private in an army of millionaires. The story is substantially as follows: William Bradford, who was the third Governor of Plymouth Colony, and one of the Pilgrims who came over from England in the Mayflower, landing on Plymouth Rock, December 22, 1620, left a munificently valuable estate when he died. He received a large amount of wealth with his second wife, Alice Carpenter, who inherited the same by the death of her first husband, an English nobleman. Bradford died a widower, and left his great wealth unbequeathed. Like sundry other valuable properties in England, the Bradford estate has, through the apathetic honesty and protection of English law, been allowed to lie untouched, and increasing in value, for over two centuries, until now it amounts to fully $100,000,000. It lies in the Bank of England, and has been the subject of active litigation for the last hundred years, there being numerous claimants, of course, in this country. They are much scattered, many living in Ohio, but the most numerous and direct still live in old Plymouth. Sarah Bradford, the last lineal descendant in the sixth generation, died there last year, in the one hundredth year of her age. Spykens, whose full name is Ephriam Bradford Spykens, is all right, that venerable lady being his own aunt. He was born in Plymouth, and traces his lineage direct to Governor Bradford and his big fortune. There being only about 10,000 legal heirs to that $100,000,000, Spykens’ share will be $10,000—not bad to take—when he takes it. He has filed his claim, together with that of his sister, over in California, and when he receives his inheritance will devote the remainder of his days in spending it, even if he has to start a new daily newspaper in Austin to do it.</p><p>SCATTERED FINDINGS.</p><p>Speaking about windfalls, Austin is the queerest old place for scattered relics and pick-ups anybody ever saw. The old-timers were evidently loose and broadcast in their ways, and even those who have come in since the flood (which occurred August 16, 1874, and not October 16, 1864, as you printed in my last week’s letter), contrive to follow suit pretty well in the way of scattering things. Observant and industrious children can pick up more old spoons, buckles, coffee-mill handles, door knobs, parts of pistols, clock wheels and other things, than they could almost anywhere else in creation. Many a youngster is rich in the possession of three and four jack-knives and several pieces of pipes of various patterns, which he has picked up in the course of his daily meanderings. The wickedest man in Austin one day last Fall picked up a huge brass key on the street. A two-line advertisement brought the grieving owner in possession of his key again. Next day he found a good jack-knife with seven blades, and a little advertisement found the happy owner. A month after he picked up a bundle, early one morning, containing two clean shirts, he needed them, but his native honesty induced him to advertise and lose them, same as he did the big brass key and the seven-bladed jack-knife, not even receiving the inexpensive thanks of the respective owners thereof. Yesterday he picked up a $20 gold piece which gleamed cheerily from the mud of the gutter. He wondered how long it had been there, and who lost it. The more he concluded he would not advertise. It is worth something to find a $20 piece, and he only charged that for finding it. It is common enough to see jack-knives, and even whole bunches of keys, advertised as lost or found, and men even advertise their wives, but nobody ever sees golden “twenties” thus advertised as found; not even greenbacks, yet money is proverbially easy to lose. If one could only contrive to find it as easily as it is lost, how nice that would be.</p><p>BASE-BALL.</p><p>The annual boom in base-ball is commencing to pervade the atmosphere of this section, and the Austin base-ballers are already shouting defiance at the B. B.’s of Eureka. Last year the Albion club came over from Eureka and got licked. The chances are that the Eureka boys may get themselves well-practiced, and some fine day walk away with the prize fixings. Those Eureka boys remember a thing or two from last year, and doubtless have additional points to go on. Anyhow, there’s lots of fun in base-ball—even more than there is in base metal ores.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE09.jpg,territorial
TE10,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….April 15, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>Weather Speculations and Telescopic Observations—Emigrations and Spring Tramps—The Land of Promise—Connubial Felicitations—Mineral Wealth and Ruby Silver—My Dear Hubbell—The Infernal Regions.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., April 13, 1883.</p><p>""Ha ! ha !"" exclaimed Professor Snider last evening, as the hail, snow and sleet came whirling down over the roofs and around the corners. ""We’re getting plenty of it, just as I predicted we would, this month. Wiggins hoodooed March; anyhow, it was by all odds the mildest, pleasantest March we have had for years, just as I told you it would be, and here now you see my snow-storms coming according to programme. Winter lingers in the lap of Spring."" Snider claims that last remark to be original with him, but then he also claims to be the author of ""The Beautiful Snow."" The mountain ranges are well whitened, and enough snow has fallen his month to insure good crops and a prosperous farming season throughout the Reese River section. East of here there has been less of it, and the ranchers are calling for more. The Professor says these ""April showers"" will continue all through the month.</p><p>ZODIAC FALLACIES.</p><p>Snider attributes Wiggins' failures as a weather prophet to too much faith in old Zodiac, the disreputable looking crank who is pictures out in the almanacs, standing so complacently with his stomach and intestines exposed in hari-kari style, and a lot of sheep, goats, lobsters, crabs and other shell-fish performing a war dance around his remains. Observations through his huge telescope on the summit of Mount Prometheus are what give the Professor his wonderful knowledge of the weather. He was a little puzzled, though, the other morning. His telescope is mounted across a couple of granite ledges, and when he went to take his usual before breakfast observation he was very much surprised to see what was evidently old Capricornus himself, one of the most popular and influential signs of the Zodiac. The head, horns and gray beard could not be mistaken, and looked of mammoth proportions. Snider gave his telescope a roll for a more favorable position, when out bounced a stray goat, which had crawled in there for shelter and repose the night before. This circumstance put him more against those almanac signs than ever.</p><p>THE SPRING EXODUS.</p><p>The population of Austin is constantly increasing through home accessions, and holds its own sufficiently to keep all the houses occupied, with the help of a few outsiders, who come to make their residence here for mining, business or other purposes. But enough Austinites leave to give place to any newcomers. Especially is this the case every Spring. Several of the old settlers have left within the last few weeks, or are preparing to leave. Some of these miners or ""tributers,"" who have had the good luck to unearth a pocket or so of rich ore, made a good ""crushing”""at the mill, and now go on a visit to the ""old country."" Others, who have carefully saved up their earnings from mechanical business or agricultural sources, desire to make their home in some more genial and productive section, where something naturally grows besides the everlasting, monotonous sagebrush. They are dreaming of grapes and grassy hillsides and tall timber, and it is not strange that their eyes and their footsteps turn to the great and promising Northwest, where the noble Columbia river flows incessantly toward the blue Pacific. August Betz, one of our old-time, hard-working citizens, left a few weeks ago for Oregon. He returned the other day, having purchased a nice little farm of 200 or 300 acres on Rogue river, seventeen miles from Jacksonville, for $3,500. He will soon take his family from here to their new home, and hopes to pass the rest of his days raising hops, spearing salmon and rolling in clover. S. Markwell has sold his little ranch on Big creek, near here, for $5,000, and with the product of last year’s crop, $5,000 more, will start shortly with his family, in two wagons, bound for Washington Territory. He expects to find the home his heart has been dreaming of on the borders of Puget Sound, and there while away the rest of his days among the lofty pines, firs and tamaracks, and die happy, leaving his family well fixed. Some of the lucky tributers who went on a visit to their friends in the old country last year, write that they are coming back shortly. Others who have left more recently, or are now about leaving, will not fail to remember how they prospered and met with good luck here, and they, too, will come back. And so Betz and Markwell may by and by tire of Oregon rains, fogs and Puget Sound monotony and experience, and desire to return to the livelier old companionship, clearer atmosphere and brighter skies of sagebrush Nevada.</p><p>MATRIMONIAL.</p><p>And this is the season of the year when the chronic Austinite, who cannot emigrate or does not care to do so, turns his attention more particularly to matrimony. He may escape during the rest of the year, or from season to season, but the genial Springtime is liable to induce a desire within his breast to browse around in the fair field of matrimony, and then it is that he can be lassoed with the connubial halter, if ever. Sundry marriages have already taken place, and more are being talked of. There is one where both parties lay aside the weeds of matrimonial bereavement to form a new and presumably happier alliance, and if financial wealth be any factor in the production of the desired happiness, each has plenty of money. Another is where neither party has any coin worth mentioning, but he is one of the most deservedly popular gentlemen in Eastern Nevada, and she a most sensible and estimable young lady. The cupboards are being built, the carpets and other furniture made ready, and they will go to housekeeping as soon as the wedding is over. All Austin stands ready to pat the festive bridegroom on the back and wish him an eternal bonanza of happiness. Even the Widow McWinzle feels more hopefully inspired, and Spykens has to keep out of her way. She wears a wilder fizzle-bang, and her montagues hook upward on each side of her countenance, like the curling breakers of the sea of eternity splashing against the Rock of Ages. (That’s the way Spykens eloquently expresses it, but not to her.) She has been writing some intense poetry and he knows it, but he carefully dodges all chances of her serving the papers on him.</p><p>RICH ORE</p><p>Has always been a peculiar feature of the mines of this locality, from the earliest times. The veins being small and highly concentrated, the ore may be comparatively scarce at times, but it is rich. And even at this late day new strikes of rich ore veins are occasionally made. Over at Yankee Blade, three or four miles north of here, on the same ore belt, several new developments of rich ore have been made within the last few months, and that locality contributes very considerably toward keeping up the present unusually long and lucrative run of the Manhattan mill. I was yesterday shown a piece of ore from the most recent strike at Yankee Blade, about as big as a teapot, which was simply a solid mass of black antimonial and ruby silver, worth $2 or $3 a pound. The vein is a foot or so in width, but, if it is largely composed of such ore as that, it may be considered a big thing.</p><p>""MY DEAR HUBBELL.""</p><p>Day before yesterday J. C. Hampton, of Virginia, and W. S. Gage, of San Francisco, both partners in the firm of Gage, Curtis & Co., grocers, Austin, were here, having arrived the night before from Virginia. They had with them Hon. Jay A. Hubbell, ex-member of Congress from Michigan, and famous as Chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee. Mr. Hubbell was brother of C. P. Hubbell, partner in the firm of Gage, Curtis & Co., who died in San Francisco last Fall, and he is in this section for the purpose of settling up his brother’s estate. Hampton and Gage were, of course, perfectly at home here, and met lots of friends, and they trotted Hubbell around lively and kept him feeling good. Hubbell being only fifty-three years old, however, skipped around as lively as either of them. He has the square-set, resolute, self-possessed style of a down-East whaling Captain, and would figure well on the quarter deck as commander of a double-turreted monitor in active engagement with the enemy. There is more to him than there looks to be, and he certainly has proved himself to be a very able and active political generalissimo, both financial and executive. By reason of a letter from Garfield to him, in which he was addressed as ""My Dear Hubbell,"" falling into the hands of the Democracy, that vexatious party has fixed that affectionate cognomen upon him—no doubt somewhat to his annoyance, from frequent repetition.</p><p>Spykens sought and was honored with an introduction. He was cordially received, and mutual compliments, etc., passed.</p><p>""Yes, I recollect the name very well, Mr. Spykens,"" said he, ""and am pleased to make your personal acquaintance.""</p><p>""Thank you. I hardly thought you would remember my name, but of course yours is known throughout the Nation. Here in Nevada even the Democracy familiarly know you as My Dear Hubbell.""</p><p>""Ugh ! (with a snort like a grizzly) I’d like to know where in h—ll I ain’t known that way.""</p><p>And Hubbell slammed the lapels of his coat across his breast and buttoned himself up with an impatient jerk, as he bobbed his figure-head and tacked the ship out of the door, where he got into the wagon with the rest to go to dinner.</p><p>It is not to be inferred that Mr. Hubbbell meant to insinuate that Nevada was the infernal regions, or that he is even known in Hades at all at present.</p><p>Hubbell, Hampton and Gage left for Ione and Grantsville yesterday morning, where Gage, Curtis & Co. have business connections established, and will return here to-morrow, taking the cars for Virginia and San Francisco next morning. Hubbell proposes staying on the coast two or three months.  ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE10.jpg,territorial
TE11,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….April 22, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>A Festive Wedding—Concealed Comstock Bonanzas—Smallpox—Sour Grapes—The Vineyard of the Lord—a Conscientious Proposition.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., April 20, 1883.</p><p>One of the approaching weddings shadowed forth in my last week’s letter took place evening before last, and was the most popular affair of the kind that ever transpired in Austin, although there was nothing ostentatious about it. It was the wedding of Alexander C. McCafferty and Miss Mary E. Barrett, both well known and popular residents of Austin. Alex. was elected County Assessor last Fall, and has more friends than anybody, and his bride is also very highly esteemed. Their wealth otherwise is not great, consequently they are all the happier. The wedding took place at a private residence, which, in Austin, does not mean an extensive house, but numerous friends managed to squeeze in and partake of the marriage feast and other hospitalities. The whole town considered itself present, anyhow, and everybody sympathized. The Lander brass band turned out in full force, and never did better. They played ""Haste to the Wedding,"" ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" ""Sweet By and By,"" and other significant pieces, and people all over town patted time to the music. Occasionally those on the back streets banged away with gun or pistol, and even the Chinese quarter testified its approbation with the explosion of a wheelbarrow load of fire-crackers and bombs. The Chinese band did not perform, but the drummer got out on the porch of their little red-faced Masonic temple and rattled away for over an hour, without pausing to grease his elbow. The happy pair received a most magnificent outfit in the way of bridal presents—a whole load of silver-ware, big pictures and a sack of flour. The ""Tasty Club,"" an association of bachelors who have eaten together for several years past, and of which Alex. was the Presiding Elder, passed a resolution to fast for a week, and as an appropriate token of their esteem, presented the newly-mated with a full set of silver spoons, knives and forks. The Widow McWinzle sat up all night trying to compose some poetry equal to the occasion, but utterly failed through her usual bad luck in rhyming the name. Yesterday Alex. had a delivery wagon out all over town, taking wine and cake to friends who were not present at the wedding. Everybody wishes him and his fair bride a big bonanza of luck in the promising mine they have located on the uncertain ledge of matrimony, and that their assessments may all be dividends.</p><p>CONCEALED BONANZAS.</p><p>It is amusing to any practical old Comstocker to notice that the regular periodical yarns and specious reports are again going the rounds of interestedly concealed ore bodies in the lower levels of the Comstock. They say that there is plenty of rich ore all along the old lode, developed by the deep drifts and winzes away down in the hottest places and mythical meanderings of the pick and diamond drill. And they say these bonanzas are kept carefully concealed and avoided until the powers that be shall obtain more desirable control, and get things their own way. All sorts of reasons, definite and indefinite, are given for this state of things, but the whole proposition, although rather encouraging, if true, partakes too largely of the intangible and mythical. Unfortunately there is no more probability in it now than there has been in times past. For it has been ever thus since childhood’s hour, in the history of the Comstock. Somebody has always been trying to delude innocent stockholders or ambitious possessors of a few dollars into such hopeful, concealed bonanza beliefs. But the history of the Comstock shows too little reality in the proposition. A new ore discovery or valuable prospect in any portion of the lode may have been held back from the knowledge of the general public for a few hours, but never for a few days, for the powers that controlled were always more than willing and anxious to produce good ore, bring it to the surface and financially realize as soon as possible. It is true that the first rich symptoms of the Crown Point bonanza were to some extent held from the public knowledge until Superintendent Jones could secure control, but meanwhile the good prospect leaked out, and the stock bouncing upward indicated something new and important in the mine. The miners themselves could not fail to make their knowledge of the situation available to themselves and friends. The fact is apparent and well known that the good prospect developed into something that really exceeded the most sanguine expectations of the ever and over-sanguine Jones himself. He had very little real knowledge of the actual value of the new find ahead of the general public, and has always been given credit for more than he was entitled to in that respect. He had no diamond drill or other means of looking beyond the face of the drift, but like all other watchful mining Superintendents he naturally had a few hours the advantage over outsiders, and good luck backed up his sanguine investments. That’s all. As to the Consolidated Virginia and California bonanza, the general public knew about as much as the insiders from the start, and in the matter of the left-handed Sierra Nevada, too much was known—or unknown—for more insiders than outsiders were slaughtered. The future history of the Comstock will show that there are no bonanzas concealed at the present time, but that some are being disadvantageously neglected and allowed to remain undiscovered in the old upper portion of the lode, above the level of the Sutro tunnel, where all past bonanzas have been found.</p><p>SMALLPOX</p><p>Has always been considered a dread disease, yet the spotted fever so fatally afflicting Carson seems far worse. The suggestion of the Appeal that it proceeds from the numerous foul privy vaults and cesspools of the town, and that they should all be cleaned out and purified forthwith, may be correct enough, yet it would seem advisable that the town should be totally evacuated by the inhabitants while that process of purification was going on. Smallpox is heard of at various points, yet does not seem to be as fatal as it is alarming and disagreeable. Over in Nevada City, California, it still rages, and seems peculiar to the inhabitants. Indeed, it seems not only peculiar, but influential in that respect, for a family who years ago used to reside in Nevada City are not reported to have the disease in Visalia.</p><p>GRAPES.</p><p>Whether grapes can be grown successfully in Nevada is being discussed some in the newspapers at present. One says it is an ""experiment which has never been tried."" That’s a mistake. J. M. Tailleur, down on Carson river, just above Dayton, has been raising grapes and making wine from them for the last three or four years. He planted a few vines near his house some years ago, to have them run over the porch by way of ornament, and was quite surprised to see that they not only grew very thriftily, but also bore good grapes in due time. He consequently and subsequently planted a nice little vineyard, with excellent success. Others in favorable localities throughout Nevada can do the same. Even in Gold Hill, the writer of this grew several bunches of grapes two or three years ago. Those grapes cost about six bits apiece, but they grew all the same, and became very sour.</p><p>CONSCIENTIOUS.</p><p>Speaking of vineyards, a young man in Austin, who is willing to work in the vineyard of the Lord occasionally when his services are called into requisition, attends Sabbath school regularly, and takes an interest in it. In the absence of the pastor he has been sometimes called upon to preside, and has kindly and efficiently done so. But he does not always seem to be perfectly at home and in his proper element, but a little nervous and not up to the regulation religious standard. The other Sunday, for instance, a studious young miss of ten year asked him: ""Mr. Jenkins, will you please tell me what is the Resurrection and the Second Death?"" Jenkins hitched around uneasily as he gently, yet conscientiously, replied: ""Well, my child, I’d rather not try to explain that to you, for I don’t believe any part of it myself !""            ALF.

Showers and passing squalls of hail and snow are the order of each day and the programme of each night, and the whole country, from the peaks of the mountain ranges to the surface foundations thereof, reposes coolly beneath a ghastly, gleaming wilderness of the beautiful snow. Strange to say, however, thirty miles east of here, in Smoky Valley, no snow or other style of moisture has fallen since the first storms of Winter, and the whole broad valley is dry as powder, with little or no snow visible on the neighboring hills and mountain ranges. Colonel Charley, the Piute Wiggins of this section, after a careful canvass of all the weather signs—animal, vegetable and otherwise—deliberately promulgates his prediction that there will be snow in every month of this year. It does look very much like it at present.</p><p>THE SPRING FIGHTS</p><p>Have opened out lively here in Austin, the principal leader in that line being one between to rantankerous members of the press, day before yesterday, on the most public street, at noonday. It was a one-sided fight, where one did all the fighting, was arrested for it, paid $30 fine, and growled because he ""hadn’t got the worth of his money."" Perhaps nothing worse may result from this disagreeable muss, but the stormy atmosphere is oppressively sulphurous with rumors of future desperate encounters, flowing wounds and blood-sprinkled sidewalks. Even the solitary crow that camps on Mount Prometheus and flies over the town occasionally croaks portentously and looks more like the ghost of an old sexton than ever.</p><p>MILL SHUT DOWN.</p><p>The Manhattan mill stopped work day before yesterday, after a prolonged and prosperous run of six months. It has merely shut down for a couple of weeks, in order to make certain necessary repairs, when it will star again with plenty of ore. This has been the longest and best run the mill has enjoyed for years, and, judging from the amount of ore on hand and in sight at the various mines, the next run may be fully as long and as prosperous as the last has been. These mines are mere surface workings as compared with those of the Comstock, and as they show no signs of exhaustion, they certainly are liable to continue their good yield for numerous years to come. In fact, there is far more ore in sight in them now than there was a year ago, and they are in better shape for productive working. The shutting down of the mill does not seem to affect the general prosperity of Austin to any very perceptible extent at any time. Things wag along in the old settled groove, regularly and without excitement, while the mill is resting the same as if it were running in full blast. Nobody in the business community seems to be getting rich, but everybody slips along in a quiet, humdrum sort of way the year round, and were it not for an occasional episode like the journalistic muss of day before yesterday, the newspapers would have a tough job to get up anything in the shape of local items.</p><p>FESTIVITIES.</p><p>Last night the Odd Fellows had a grand ball, the finest of the season. It was very fully attended and ran till daylight this morning. Yesterday was another high jinks day with our Mongolian residents. They flew one big red flag with a white border, and a brilliant green silk banner floated above it from the top of the mainmast, while along the front of their joss house and Masonic Temple numerous other flags were displayed. A large amount of firecrackers and bombs were exploded during the day and evening, their band of very barbarous musicians played on the upper deck of the temple, and there was a sound of promiscuous revelry throughout the celestial quarter. What it was all about they did not explain, other than to say that it was a ""belly good time,"" which doubtless means a feast. These Chinese may be heathens, but judging by the frequency of their festivities they have more fun than anybody.</p><p>THE INDIANS’ ORCHARD.</p><p>Newspaper mention of the recent visit of a United States special timber agent to the nut pine regions of Como, to look after the timber on the public domain, reminds us of a similar circumstance which occurred nearly twenty years ago, when I was a resident of that same locality. On the 12th of October, 1863, young Winnemucca, the noted war chief of the Piutes, came to Como, accompanied by about a dozen of his braves, all mounted on horseback. At their request quite a number of the principal citizens met them at the chief saloon, kept by ""Martin, the Wizard."" Winnemucca was rather a fine looking Indian, of about thirty-five years, full average hight, straight and dignified, face painted brick red, a few eagle feathers stuck in his hair, and he wore shoes, pants and a gray blanket, but no hat. All the rest of his crowd wore hats—and clothes. He addressed us through an interpreter to the following effect: He had learned that the whites were cutting and destroying the nut pine timber which so bountifully covered the hills of that section, and had come to request them stop doing so. They were welcome to use all the dead timber which strewed the hillsides, for firewood, but they must not cut the live trees. Those trees were the ""Indians orchard."" For hundreds of years they had harvested the nuts that grew on them so plentifully, ""same as white men catchum apples in his orchard,"" said he. ""Injun mans no cuttum white man’s orchard trees—no likum white man cuttum Injun’s orchard all same."" These were the instructions officially given from Chief Winnemucca, and it was his urgent request and command that they should be abided by. These lands belonged to the Piute tribe, and until some definite treaty should be made, their rights must be respected, and their nut orchards held inviolate by the ruthless ax of the miner or the woodchopper. The instructions of the great Chief were received with due decorum and assented to. During the interview, Winnemucca spoke not a word of English, but watched every man and motion very carefully and intelligently with his keen, bright eye, and at the conclusion mounted his pony with an agile leap, waving his hand royally by way of farewell as he rode away, with his dusky escort. Young Winnemucca died several years ago, and was a very different sort of a man from the old peace Chief Winnemucca, who died last Fall. The Indians’ orchards about Como are not there now. Nobody quit cutting the timber as long as there was any left to haul to market.</p><p>THE SUTRO TUNNEL.</p><p>If about half of the Sutro tunnel could be cut off and brought to Austin, it would be a valuable acquisition and of material assistance in the deep working of these mines, for no such tunnel exists or is projected in this locality. And to an old Comstocker it seems a pity that the Sutro tunnel should not be made more available than it is in the development of the old lode. Surely its westward mission has not ended. With the compliments of Superintendent Thomas I received, a few days ago, a copy of the recent annual report of the company. That of a year ago indicated a desire to push the tunnel still further westward, but this says nothing about it. The supposed west wall of the Comstock, the hard syenite or ""diorite,"" as Professor Gunning calls the country rock of Mount Davidson, should not be considered the ""pent-up Utica,"" confining the progress of the Sutro tunnel westward. A thousand feet further might develop bonanza wonders. Grand golden treasure possibilities and probabilities remain unexplored and unrevealed within the deep abdominal fastnesses of old Mount Davidson, and the Sutro tunnel is the keyhole to the mystic realm of boundless wealth. Will the key never be turned, the door opened and the problem solved?</p><p>DISEASE AND DEATH.</p><p>Speaking of mines, we residents of Eastern Nevada are taught by the newspapers of Reno and Carson to believe those places to be perfect mines of deadly disease—festering bonanzas of corruption. Reno looks fair enough on the surface, but its substratum has imbibed enough descending filth to constitute one vast reservoir of seething rottenness, on top of which Reno stands like a poultice on a boil, liable to be disrupted and devastatingly demoralized at the first hot spell of weather. Carson is represented as an outspread saturation of privy vaults and cesspools that people live on top of, waiting for a hot-weather epidemic to wipe them out. Why should fair Carson and promising Reno be rivals in such matters as well as in everything else? The chances are, however, that neither place is as bad as it is represented, or as it might be.

TE13,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….May 6, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>May-Day With Strawberries and Snow Cream—Lamb and Green Peas—Austin Fruits—Army Horses for Arizona—Mill Recuperation—A Long Shaft for a Long Belt—An Acceptable Brick—Carson and Colorado Prospects—Is Sharon Really on Deck—Knights of Pythias—A Connubial Mash.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., May 4, 1883.</p><p>Nobody in this section ever saw a rougher May-day than was last Tuesday. Snow and hail fell fast and furious all day, and if it had been a little colder, good sleighing would have been furnished, but although several inches fell, only four or five inches at a time kept in sight and that was soft and murky, not lasting long. If there is anything in the old saying of the weather sharps about a month coming in like a lion and going out like a lamb, the closing of May should be exceedingly lamb-like. Green peas are already plenty in our markets, and in the matter of strawberries Austin is not at all behind the Comstock. Cherries are also in market, and all the other fresh fruits will be along in due season. Snow, frost or any other adverse conditions of the weather make no difference to the Austin fruit and vegetable market. Even at the worst we have enough canned fruits at the grocery stores to last a year or so.</p><p>HORSES FOR ARIZONA.</p><p>An army agent has been engaged the last two or three weeks in Reese River Valley buying 300 horses for cavalry service in Arizona, and the other day a Colonel, a Captain, a Lieutenant and an Inspector arrived here by rail from San Francisco to attend to the matter. They quartered themselves at private lodgings, bringing along their own whisky, tobacco and similar commissary stores, and yesterday they got a carriage and rode out to Rooker’s ranch, on the river, some eight or ten miles from here, where the horses have been gathered in by various parties from all directions. The Inspector is supposed to pass judgment upon each and every animal, seriatim; but what the Colonel, Captain and Lieutenant have to do in the matter is not clearly  understood, unless they are along to inspect the Inspector, and stick red tape and sealing wax on each horse as fast as they are passed upon and accepted. From here the horses will be driven to Wadsworth, and then shipped by rail to San Francisco, whence the cavalry will proceed to Arizona with all possible dispatch, there to join General Crook in his efforts to subjugate the hostile, murdering Apaches. To most people it would seem a little strange that these army agents should come over into Nevada for cavalry horses, instead of seeking them in the southern ranching sections of California; but they say that horses, although plenty and cheap there, are generally too small and scrubby. What they want is good, sound, well-broken horses, none less than fifteen hands and an inch high, and at prices from $60 to $120 each. The chances are that Uncle Sam will have to pay the latter figure for every horse.</p><p>RECUPERATING.</p><p>The repairs and overhauling of the Manhattan mill are progressing energetically. After a steady run of six months, the pan-millers and other ore reduction arrangements were naturally found to be much worn and in need of renovation, but the most imperative reason for the stoppage was the giving out of the large heavy belt running from the batteries to drive the pan department. This belt was of rubber, twenty inches wide and about 150 feet long. It cost $600, and had been running about three years. Like its predecessors, it had to wear out in due time, splitting and calling for frequent patching up of late. The first belt placed there cost $1,000. Some weeks ago, in view of this belt giving out, and the cost of maintaining belts in that particular and very essential position, it was decided to substitute a line shaft with bevel gearing at each end. The requisite shaft, with all its attachments, boxes, gearing, etc., was accordingly cast and prepared at the foundry and machine shops of the company, and was got ready just as the big belt refused further duty. The shaft is four inches in diameter and seventy feet long, being cast in sections of about twelve feet each. The whole constitutes a very creditable piece of work for an establishment away out in the hills—in fact, it could not have been done any better in San Francisco or the East. Moreover, several little improvement, original here, were adopted. For instance, to each one of the series of boxes or journal bearings is attached a substantial iron plate two or three inches square, which, by means of a strong spiral spring, is made to constantly press a square cake of tallow against the journal, thus keeping it amply and unfailingly lubricated. A solid foundation of stone is now being prepared, and in a couple of weeks or so the shaft will be in place, all other requisite repairs completed, and the mill started into full operation again.</p><p>NEAT AND APPRECIATIVE.</p><p>W. A. Hall, foreman of the Manhattan machine shops, was a day or two ago unexpectedly made the pleased recipient of a handsome as well as valuable present from Melville Curtis, Superintendent of the company. It was in the shape of a very neatly moulded bar or brick of silver bullion, seven inches long by three inches wide, and an inch and a half thick, weighing 117 ounces and worth about $150. It was presented as a mark of esteem and appreciation of his long and efficient services. Mr. Hall is a thorough master mechanic, and has been in command of the blacksmithing and machinery department for thirteen years, commencing with a small forge in a 10X12 shanty, and increasing with the requirements, year by year, until now he runs about 150 feet of machine shop, complete in every respect. He is a very energetic, as well as ingenious, mechanic, originating many valuable improvements, and will terminate his long and faithful service by a trip to his old home in the East, where he proposes to settle down with a comfortable competence, financially, for the rest of his days. Ross, the famous and trusty messenger on the Central Pacific Railroad, who recently so valiantly defended the express car for some hours successfully against a band of desperate attacking robbers, was rewarded with a gold watch and $1,000 in coin. Now, let robbers lay for that, and also for Hall’s silver brick, when he passes over the road. But Hall thinks a heap of that little brick, and would fight as hard for it as Ross would for a whole car-load of treasure.</p><p>AUSTIN PROSPECTORS.</p><p>Many a former resident and worker of the mines of Austin can now be found hopefully extending his mineralogical investigations to other parts of the State, and in all newly developed and promising localities. Thus it is that they are found at various promising points along the vicinity of the Carson and Colorado Railroad. In Walker Lake Mining District, at the foot of Walker Lake, within five miles of Hawthorne, some Austinites have a little five-stamp mill, recently started into operation, working ore from their mines on Cat creek, near by. They are meeting with excellent paying success thus far, and expect dto be millionaires in due time. During the coming season some very important and valuable mining developments are pretty sure to be made in the interesting section of country now being opened up by the Carson and Colorado Railroad.</p><p>HOPEFUL.</p><p>Has Sharon really regained control of the Yellow Jacket Mine? If so, waterlogged Gold Hill has a more hopeful future for its end of the Comstock. He will not care to pump out all that water from the lower levels just yet, but he will go for the upper workings and old bonanza levels for all they are worth. The Yellow Jacket is the old king pin of the situation. Sharon got crowded out and has been kept back long enough, and if he has really succeeded in getting the upperhand of the situation once more, he has thousands of friends to rejoice that the quiet little keen-eyed boss financier is on deck again. Anyhow, everybody has been willing to welcome a change where the chances are for the better. The Comstock has been and still is the mining pulse of the State, and the leading indication of its financial health, wealth and prosperity.</p><p>THE KNIGHTS.</p><p>Grand Chancellor Mitchell, of the Knights of Pythias in this State, has paid his visit to the Lodges of Eastern Nevada, and gone back to his Comstock home. His stay in Austin was brief, but he seemed to enjoy it hugely, and stayed one day longer than he intended, for he was exceedingly well treated. Toiyabe Lodge No. 9, here in Austin, is composed of the best citizens, well up to the work, and is well organized, splendidly conducted and deservedly flourishing. All true Knights are welcome within their castle hall, and their latch string hospitably hangs outward. Mitchell took a good and appreciative look at the public institutions, the resources and the loaves and fishes of Austin. He critically and approvingly inspected the various mining works and the mill, but never liking to leap recklessly, as it were, he did not plunge into the deep, dark recess of the mines. He left Austin well impressed, however, and may visit us again some day, perhaps.</p><p>Sypkens willfully stays out in the hills, prospecting, and the Widow McWinzle has given him up as a hopeless case. He can now return with perfect impunity, for she has made a successful mash on Professor Snider. The festive old fellow wilts under the melting influence of her poetically sympathetic eyes, like a pigweed beneath the rays of the midsummer sun, and it is not difficult to foresee a connubial consolidation. The widow is not poor, neither physically nor financially, and Snider is resigned. Some of the envious and unkind slyly whisper that it’s a ""big joke on Snider,"" but he thinks he can stand it. The widow has at last found a name that she can rhyme into poetic verse, and gently, hopefully, murmurs and scribbles Snider, bider, hider, guider, wider, cider, ride-ah !</p><p>ALF.

TE14,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….May 13, 1883</p><p>Entered at the Postoffice at Virginia City, Nevada, as second-class matter.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>A Juvenile Horse Boom—Tributers’ Luck, and Fortune’s Tribute—A Gold Hiller’s Grand Recognition—Eastern Nevada Mining Prospects—Another Promising Mine—A Political Squib—Weathercocks.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., May 11, 1883.</p><p>The Colonel, Captain, Lieutenant and the Inspector mentioned in my last week’s letter as being here buying up all the able-bodied regulation-sized horses they could find in Reese River Valley and vicinity for United States cavalry service down in Arizona, left the equine rendezvous, Rooker’s ranch, on the river, day before yesterday, with over 300 head, driving to Wadsworth, where they will be shipped over the Central Pacific to San Francisco, thence to be forwarded to the seat of Indian war in Arizona. Another band of horses also passed down the valley, bound for Wyoming. This exodus of horses included several mares with young colts. These colts being too young to be taken along were given away to whoever would take them. Our Austin school-boys somehow got wind of it, and the result was a general surreptitious rush for the valley of boys, little and big, regardless as to whether school kept or not. The colts all got owners, and quite a number were brought to town. One boy came home the happy proprietor of two colts, while other colts came in with half a dozen ambitious proprietors apiece. One little yellow colt paraded the main street, the center of attraction of an admiring crowd of small boys, all of whom claimed an interest in him, and he pranced and frisked about apparently interested in them all. About dusk his lodgings were decided upon, and he marched to a woodshed on a back street amid a triumphal procession of boys and girls bearing bunches of hay, pitchers of milk, sugar, chunks of bread or anything they thought he would eat. It was some like a circus parade, and many of them would have been delighted to sleep with that colt if their parents or big brothers and sisters had not hunted them up and taken them home. Young Austin now talks juvenile horse, and this sudden dispensation of colts is the chief sensation of the day.</p><p>FORTUNE’S FAVORITES.</p><p>Every run of the mill gives good luck to somebody, especially among the tribute workers in the mines. Many who thus suddenly realize a nice sum of money from the crushing of their little ore piles, as the result of many or a few months' patient search and successful labor, just quietly square up all their back bills, put some coin in the bank, and quietly go ahead working for a larger stake. And it is claimed by the storekeepers and others interested that many who thus become lush in the way of funds ""sink"" their money and forget or neglect to come forward and settle either new or old bills. Others again, after honorably liquidating their indebtedness, have a good time with their friend, get themselves an outfit of store clothes, and take a trip to their old home, or depart to make a new home in some more genial and promising locality. Harry Blewett, formerly of Gold Hill, and well and favorably known among the miners of the Comstock, left Wednesday morning for a visit to his relatives and friends in the old country. He goes to Camborne parish, Cornwall, whence come so many of our best English mining boys. Harry has been a hard worker in these mines for the last half dozen years, and recently struck it pretty good in the Ruby, where fortune favored him with a nice bunch or so of high-grade ore. He takes along plenty of coin to have a good time with, and leaves some behind for a nest-egg, proposing to return in the course of three or four months. Harry is deservedly popular, and his numerous friends gave him a private complimentary social on Saturday evening as a sort of well-wishing send-off. August Betz, another bonanza man and old resident, leaves next Monday morning with his family for their new home in Oregon. Speaking of bonanza men, I notice that</p><p>A GOLD HILLER</p><p>Appears to be in luck. A Washington dispatch, dated May 7, says: ""The President has recognized H. Harrison, of Gold Hill, Nevada, as Vice Consul for Denmark."" Now, this can be none other than our festive, rheumatic friend, ""Old Man Harris,"" the well-known old-time assayer of Gold Hill and Silver City. Everybody knows him, and he knows everybody else. He is a well-read man; in fact, belongs to the Improved Order of Red Men, I think, and is very way well fitted for the Danish Consulship, speaking the language like a native. He probably obtains this Presidential “recognition” through the influence of Senator Jones, who has always been his warm friend. The worst that can be said of Harris is that he has harassed his friends and neighbors always with the worst puns that a chronic punster is capable of, and it may be considered that Jones is doing a social service in shipping him off to Denmark. Harris has been constantly afflicted with rheumatic pains and contortions as a standing punishment for his incessant puns, but he can’t help punning, anyhow. If he were dying in a garret, his last rheumatic remark would be: ""This is a room-attic arrangement.”</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>Throughout Eastern Nevada mining matters are at present rather on the improve. Even the mines of Eureka are looking up a little, and Tuscarora is inclined to boom. Here in the Reese River section things in that line are looking well, and promising better. Pending the repairs to the mill the mines of Austin are actively working, with a large amount of ore in sight, and a good prospect for keeping the mill running three or four months or more, when it starts up again, which will be in about a week. Out at Jefferson and Ophir Canyons the mines are being energetically worked, and making regular bullion shipments, and at Grantsville and Belmont the old workings are being started up, with better promise than usual for a strong and successful season’s work, and permanent future success. In fact all mining operations south of here, in the Toiyabe range, excepting the Victorine mine, at Kingston, are decidedly looking up. Over in Nye county work is being promisingly resumed at various points, and the season generally throughout this section is opening auspiciously.</p><p>A GOOD MINE,</p><p>Which has been struggling under a cloud, is now being brought out properly at Midas Flat, a couple of miles to the northward of here. It is one of the oldest locations in the county, and is known as the Breen mine. The original locators of it did pretty well at first, but finally starves out and abandoned it. After lying idle for years it was relocated by Breen, who, with his partner, have been working it for the last five or six years. They put up a horse whim to do the hoisting, and occasional good bunches of ore met with have kept them in beans ad bacon, but the ledge was small and unreliable and they had considerable water to contend with, so they could not get rich. Latterly, at the depth of about 150 feet, they developed a very respectable looking ledge, beyond the “breaks,” which shows from a foot to eighteen inches of high-grade antimonial or ruby silver ore, which will mill away up in the hundreds. The other day Breen sold out to a company of capitalists for $20,000, and a strong force of men are now at work enlarging and timbering the shaft, and arranging for steam hoisting works, with a view to working the mine for all it is worth. It promises to develop into a very valuable bit of mining property.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>What’s the matter with old Ben. Butler? He seems to be getting cranky in his old age, as well as narrow-minded in his ideas. Because we of the Pacific Coast have carried our point in the exclusion of the low-working Chinese, he expresses his desire to do the same in the matter of Irish immigration. Now that he has been made Governor of Massachusetts by the Democratic Irish vote, he coolly says he would like to prevent the landing of any more poor Irish on the sacred wharves of Boston. None but high-toned Chinamen or well-to-do Irishmen will suit the esthetic immigration ideas of the aristocratic Governor of Massachusetts. The chances are that Ben. Butler is at heart a very illiberal American, saturated with the unprogressive opinion that either Americans or Irish should only rule one country at a time, and be recognized, identified and defined in their allegiance. Perhaps shrewd old Ben. Is deliberately planning to be elected Know-Nothing President of the United States; but he never will be. The Democracy elected him Governor of the old fossilized State of Massachusetts. Perhaps they may continue to admire and indorse the old cock-eyed politician, puffed up with his illiberal American ideas, and keep on voting for him.</p><p>SPECULATIVE.</p><p>The Digger Indians, over in California, are stated to be predicting a very hot Summer. That may do for the Golden State, but, as stated in one of my recent letters, Colonel Charley, our Piute Wiggins, distinctly and irrevocably states that there will be snow in every month this year. This is a cool and hopefully refreshing assurance for us residents of the sagebrush. Professor Snider inclines to the opinion that Charley may not be far from right, and dogmatically recites his original proverb: ""Winter still lingers in the lap of Spring.</p><p>ALF.

TE15,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….May 20, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Merry Month of May—Church Festivities and Amenities—Hobart’s Boiler Scale Ideas—Base Range Base Ball—The Glory and Obnoxiousness of Wealth—Unportable Dollars—Journalistic Luck—Memorial Day.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., May 18, 1883.</p><p>""Hail, all Hail, thou merry month of May,"" should have been written by the author of ""Beautiful Snow."" Anyhow there has been more merry hail played with the weather during the present month of May than the oldest Austinite ever saw, either before or since the flood. Hail squalls are the order of the day, and three inches of snow the order of each night, to melt or run off or soak in by noon. The soil here takes up water like a sponge, being of a decomposed granite formation, without much clay, therefore it is never muddy two hours after a hailstorm or a flood. Bishop Whitaker, who is paying his annual visit to the various parishes of his diocese in the eastern part of the State, arrived here from Belmont Tuesday evening, and is circulating pleasantly among his Episcopal and other Gentile friends. The ladies of the church had arranged for an elaborate and attractive strawberry and ice cream festival to be given last evening, but postponed it on account of the weather until some time next week. Strawberries are plentiful enough, and bigger than ever before seen here, but the bountiful surplus of hail and snow was too much of a stand-off for the ice cream proposition. Since the departure of Rev. Mr. Eastman for more verdant and nutritious pastures in the East, our handsome little Episcopal church has been without a pastor having been assigned to fill Mr. Eastman’s place, the church will probably remain shut down, so to speak, for the present. It is a good field for a smart and popular preacher.</p><p>SCALY SENATORIAL IDEAS.</p><p>Hon. W. W. Hobart paid us a flying visit last Friday, to look after some little business matters. Hobart was one of the old timers here, being associated in business with Gridley, the famous Sanitary Flour-sack man, therefore he found a host of friends to shake hands and smile with. He attended the ball of the A. O. H. in the evening and got no sleep, as he left on the morning train. Hobart is happy and prosperous. He makes his headquarters in San Francisco, and is traveling agent for a patent arrangement for preventing scale in boilers. He says it is the biggest thing in America, and he expects to make big money, like John Mackay, during the next year or two. Some of our shrewd political sharps, however, affect to look upon this brief visit from Hobart as having something deeper than boiler scale in its significance; that his boiler scale proposition was merely a blind to conceal sundry political wires he is laying for himself or somebody else, which will be developed in next year’s campaign—perhaps for Jones as United State Senator. Nobody seems to know of any wires or signs of wires laid by him, however, and the chances are that he did not lay any. In fact he declared that he had gone out of politics altogether, and gone in devotedly on boiler scale as a basis of future wealth and fame. He is an experienced newspaper man, but nobody suspected that he had an eye to starting a new daily paper in Austin.</p><p>BASE RANGE BASEBALL.</p><p>Last year a baseball club from Eureka came and played a big match game with a club of our Austin boys, and returned home to the Base Range badly beaten. The other day a new club from here went over to Eureka, to follow up that victory and scoop up the Base Rangers on their own dunghill, as it were. Latest advices from there, however, are to the effect that our boys got seriously scooped themselves; score 21 to 14. They will ride home nevertheless, and can, no doubt, explain the cause of this strange and unexpected discrepancy in the count. The slag, base metal and furnace-fumed atmosphere of Eureka operate as so many heavy influences, preventing the best players from winning. The Eureka boys had every advantage in being acclimated.</p><p>ALMIGHTY DOLLARS.</p><p>The most experienced moralists on the subject of the Fair divorce are quite unanimous on the proposition that, had it not been for an overplus of almighty dollars in the family, there would not have been any separation or divorce. They argue that, were it not for those golden millions unexpectedly accumulated, the affections of our Uncle James would not have strayed away from the wife of his less noted and more impecunious days. Those who knew them best, when poor, remember that they got along very happily together, and even in the first developing of their great financial prosperity, domestic happiness and mutual affection reigned within their little family circle. Those who have similarly rolled on Fortune’s wheels into the sphere of unlimited and unexpected wealth may be able to explain and account for such domestic changes, but to most of us it is a consoling as well as powerful argument against getting rich and allowing our better natures to be sordidly or otherwise vitiated, or crushed beneath an overpowering weight of almighty dollars. But the sequel to this domestic romance may be looked for in some future matrimonial alliance, for people who become rich and noted are always the most watched and enviously talked about—another argument against getting rich. And after all, even the richest man in the world ever saw cannot take a cent away when he dies, but has to leave his whole pile for somebody else to enjoy or squander, while he lies beneath their feet, far more helpless and infinitely poorer than when he first came into the world. Here in Austin, recently, an old pioneer died. He was considered poor, but had been a man of public note and respectability, and, although he had no wife and family to care for him in his old age, kind friends provided for his every want, smoothed his way  to the mystic beyond, and a large procession followed his remains to the cemetery. When his little box, which he had kept at the bank for safe-keeping, was then opened, instead of containing, as was supposed, merely documents and papers, they found not only a lot of valuable notes and mining stocks, but several hundred dollars in gold coin; in fact, quite a little bonanza for the Public Administrator, or somebody else, to dispose of. The old pioneer had none but an ideal enjoyment of it in life, and left it behind to be a matter of astonishment to his sympathizing friends. Speaking about</p><p>LIFE’S CHANGES</p><p>And fortunes, I noticed an item in the ENTERPRISE the other day about a remarkable printer, who put by a nickel every time one of his fellow-workmen went out to get a drink, and in the course of a few years found himself a rich man. That reminds us of the newspaper proprietor who had to furnish the nickels every time the printers went out to take a drink. By and by he found himself a poor man and fired out, while every one of those remarkable printers subsequently became newspaper proprietors, or other styles of bonanza men, in various parts of the country.</p><p>MEMORIAL DAY,</p><p>Or, as many erroneously and not appropriately designate it, Decoration Day, is near at hand, and should be generally observed in proper style. Here in Austin it will be. We have a Post of the Grand Army, and a newly-organized military company, who will observe the day, and there will doubtless be a general turn-out on the occasion, unless the present chronically stormy weather should prevail to a discouraging extent.

There, as heretofore stated, he is a principal owner of the Twin River mine. It is one of the oldest and most famous mining locations in this section, and was formerly known as the Murphy mine. It has yielded large quantities of silver bullion in times past, but through mismanagement its productiveness failed, and it gradually fell into disrepute. About a year ago, through the representations of L. J. Hanchett, a well-posted mining man, Seely and other capitalists in Denver became purchasers of the mine for $20,000. With Hanchett as Superintendent, a new working shaft was started, first class hoisting works erected, the old twenty-stamp mill overhauled, and everything put in good trim for successful future operations before Winter set in. The mine is now yielding handsome returns in the shape of regular bullion shipments—$1,200 or $1,400 every three or four days. Another company of capitalists having secured the Jefferson Canyon mines, some fifteen miles to the southward, a similar yield of bullion is coming in from there for shipment, and the Belmont mines have resumed production and bullion shipments. Thus it will be seen that quite a lively stream of bullion is again flowing from the mining section southward of here, which, added to the regular production of our local mines, brings Austin into strong and increasing prominence as a bullion-shipping point. Seely is taking a look at his mine and will be back in a day or two. He prospered much, financially, in Denver, and has now bought him a vine and fig tree in Oakland, where he will dwell with his little family amid the salubrious sea breezes and fogs, and end his days peacefully and comfortably in full view of the Golden Gate and the broad blue Pacific.</p><p>MINERALOGICAL.</p><p>People of mining experience and observation are cognizant of the fact that the mineral resources of Nevada, and especially the great eastern portion, are far from being understood or appreciated; indeed, they are merely in the infancy of their development. This section of the State is simply a vast plateau, intersected with numerous isolated ranges of hills and mountains of greater or lesser magnitude, and all of a strongly mineralized character. Good timber is not abundant, and the streams are not large, yet there is sufficient wood and water most anywhere to meet all ordinary demands, and the pasturage is excellent. The pioneers of this State, during the first rush of the silver excitement, scattered themselves prospecting for more Comstock ledges throughout these little mountain ranges and valleys, and they certainly did do a vast amount of prospecting. The result was the discovery of numerous mining localities of various degrees of merit and eligibility, very few of which were properly developed. Therefore it was that those which showed mineral wealth superficially abundant and the easiest got at, like Pioche, White Pine and similar other places, were suddenly brought into brilliant prominence, and as speedily were worked into a decline and comparative obscurity. Scores of little towns and mining settlements sprang into a sort of mushroom existence, and, in turn, were abandoned; yet few were destitute of real merit. Thus it is that the localities mentioned in the commencement of this letter as now producing remuneratively in bullion have passed through their seasons of mismanagement and disrepute to a prosperous certainty. And this will yet be the experience of many others of the old localities. Moreover, the former prospectors, nor those of subsequent days, did not find all the mines, or even explore all the eligible localities by any means. They merely found those which were the most readily accessible, and it still remains for gradually advancing civilization, as it were, to most surely and systematically develop the real mineral wealth of the country. The mines thus far found have mostly been near the main routes of travel through the State, one discovery leading to another. Wherever new routes of travel and new sections are opened, there will new mining discoveries be made. Look at the section now being opened up and developed by the Carson and Colorado Railroad, for instance. And in the not-far distant future another new railroad will pass through the very promising and comparatively unexplored country away south of Eureka, Austin and the old central routes of Overland Travel, and very possibly develop more and better mines than have yet been opened outside of the Comstock. The probabilities in that direction are exceedingly good. Moreover, competitive transportation facilities will give us cheaper living, cheaper materials and appliances for more advantageous working, and many a mine of known value will be worked which is obliged to lie idle now. Throughout Eastern Nevada are many such mines, and not a few can be designated right here in the Reese River section. Nevada has a more prosperous future than most of us, at the present time, squarely anticipate or fairly appreciate.</p><p>AUSTIN AMENITIES.</p><p>Church affairs occupy a due share of Austin public attention, considerably more than baseball, although balls, dances, surprise parties and similar festivities of an irregular nature are exceedingly well patronized. It is true that the practice games of the baseball club every Sunday are witnessed by many a good, churchgoing Christian, and that some even went with the club on its recent disastrous expedition to Eureka; but it seems requisite to the average Austinite to mix some kind of festivity with his religion, like bitters or wine in his cocktail. Last evening the postponed festival of the Episcopal ladies took place at International Hall. Numerous tables were loaded with strawberries, ice cream, cake and raspberry lemonade, a full string band discoursed the most inspiring music, the prettiest girls in town waited upon the tables, and the weather was delightful; yet, strange as it may seem, this festival was a sad failure, financially, the attendance being decidedly poor. Everything was delicious, and the failure must be attributed to that string band—only that and nothing else.</p><p>""Music arose with its voluptuous swell—</p><p>Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spoke again,"" etc.</p><p>Yes, there were the fiddles, the clarinet, the bass viol, the piano, and the jolliest, most inspiring dance music; but alas ! no dancing was allowed. It was Hamlet left out of ""Hamlet"" with a vengeance; Christmas dinner and no turkey; lemonade without sugar. If the music also had been left out it would have been all right, for who wanted to go there to be thus aggravated? The few young fellows and girls who were present hitched around impatiently in their seats, or drummed waltzes and quadrilles with their shoes, tapping time to the music, getting more and more nervous, until finally, one after the other, they all got out and went home exasperated before 11 o'clock. One of the most substantial church-goers in Austin is an old Comstocker. He weighs about 160, and has a voice like Jack Stephens, of Gold Hill. He would like to sing in the choir, but they do not require him. With a proper amount of stops, brakes and governors fixed to him he might do for a church organ, but in solo or chorus he could drown a locomotive or a Washoe mule. And to hear him roar his favorite song of ""Meet me there at Heaven’s gate, sweet Belle Mahone,"" is too snortingly utter for anything—just as though he would be allowed singing around there anyhow. It would be like the famous ram's-horn blast which was blown beneath the walls of Jericho.</p><p>ANOTHER RUN.</p><p>The mill started up again on Monday morning, after a three weeks' rest, and is pounding and grinding away after its chronic regulation style, with plenty of ore to keep it busy for three or four months or more. The new line shaft, seventy feet in length, with bevel gearing, from the batteries to connect with and run the pan department, works splendidly. As stated in a previous letter, it is in sections of about twelve feet each. It is of the best wrought iron and all its couplings, journal boxes, bevel wheels and other castings, together with the requisite turning, etc., was done at the foundry and machine shop of the company right here in Austin. It is a very substantial, neat and well-finished bit of work and no better can be turned out this side of San Francisco. This mill is a dry crushing establishment and works the ore by the Stedefeldt process, therefore does not rush through so many tons a day as the Comstock mills or wet crushing mills generally. Like the mills of the gods, ""it grinds slowly, but grinds exceedingly fine."" And it pans out rich.</p><p>VALE.</p><p>The Widow McWinzle and Professor Snider got married very quietly Tuesday evening and left for Los Angeles next morning, where, in the land of sunshine and flowers and of the vine and fig tree, they will make their future home and be happy drying raisins and raising chickens for a living. The widow, however, has coin enough in bank to keep them both above want. The Professor magnanimously left his big telescope on top of Mount Promethius for our friend Spykens, just to show that he bore no malice and did not wish to triumph over him. As for Spykens himself, he has come in from the hills, now that the widow is married and gone, and feels better, notwithstanding the following, which she sent him as a parting shot:</p><p>Conceited Spykens sought to take</p><p>His charms away from love and me,</p><p>But where those charms did chiefly lay</p><p>I’m blessed if I could ever see.</p><p>In parting with the Widow McWinzle and Professor Snider Austin society loses heavily, but everybody wishes them well, knowing that what is their gain is our loss.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE16.jpg,territorial

The strawberry crop is consequently more abundant, and the Methodist ladies propose giving a festival for the benefit of the church this evening. Dancing will be allowed, and no person of affluence or general affability will be excluded. Hot weather is not always favorable to the religious condition of Austin, and every Sunday an excursion train takes a crowd of festive devotees a few miles down the railroad track to some eligible spot where they can play baseball, shoot glass balls and drink beer. This warm weather also seems to have stirred up things in the law line, and the Justice of the Peace is getting rich. Last week he put the editor of the Democrat in jail for contempt of court, and next day that editor went in on his only hope of fortune in this world by suing the Judge for $10,000 for false imprisonment. Then there was a case where a fellow was caught breaking into a man’s premises and stealing pigeons. It was decided that pigeons are wild game and common property, therefore there was no burglary nor larceny in the matter. Next day the pigeon proprietor met the alleged thief, and tried to play for even by choking him a little. He was fined $30 for that, and fails to see where the profits on the pigeon business comes in. Then a Deputy United States Marshal levied on some of the principal business houses and collected a few hundred dollars on a judgment from the Supreme Court. More legal trouble is anticipated, and the lawyers feel prosperous. Speaking of</p><p>CONTEMPT OF COURT,</p><p>Reminds me of the way Justice Putnam, of Gold Hill, sat down on Lawyer Stephens. It was a chicken stealing case, or something equally important, and Stephens came down from Virginia as attorney for the defendant, with a whole wheelbarrow load of law books, which he piled jupon the table. The case was duly opened, and ""Stevy,"" entrenched beside his huge pile of legal authorities, raked the chestnut locks away from his massive brow with his finger, threw himself back on his gambrel joints, and started in to make an eloquent speech on the subject.</p><p>""Your Honor is well aware that before the immortal palladium of American freedom law and equity reign supreme. In order to support my argument, and influence your Honor’s opinion in this important case, I will proceed to read a few extracts from the famous legal authorities before us. Here, your Honor, we have""—</p><p>""Hold on right there, Mr. Stephens. I ain’t goin' to stand none of yer taffy in this racket.

Do you have the cheek to insinuate that this Court don’t know law? By the holy poker, you jest open another one o' them books on me and I’ll commit you fer contempt of Court. I oughter rule the defendant guilty, right here, but I guess I jest dismiss the case. Court's adjourned. You get out, and go home with yer books, and don’t you ever try to impose 'em on me again. Not a word outer yer head, or contempt goes.""</p><p>THE FOURTH</p><p>Of July will be along shortly, and although that glorious day has been allowed to pass comparatively unnoticed here in Austin for the last few years, the chances are that it will be properly observed this time, as was the recent Memorial Day. We have a newly-organized military company and a consequent increase of patriotism, plenty of flags, powder and fireworks; why should we not celebrate? I notice by the ENTERPRISE that your citizens take no interest and show no sign whatever of a desire to celebrate the day. But just let Carson or Reno send invitations to your military companies, or the Gold Hillers attempt their old-time heresy of getting up a separate celebration of the grand old national holiday, and Virginia will have a red-hot celebration of the Fourth, got up in about four days.</p><p>THE LOCAL REPORTER.</p><p>Austin is one of the liveliest places on the Pacific Coast for a good local reporter. Something is always happening, every once in a while, or oftener, and the reporter with the liveliest imagination can get in his work oftener than anybody. Mining accidents are not frequent, and the doctors have little to do; very little fighting whisky is sold, most of the saloons being two-bit houses, but the Piute and the Chinese are a never-failing source of some kind of items. The Piutes live on the hillsides, amid the fragrant sagebrush, and do most of the washing, wood chopping and general household chores for the town. John Chinaman has his little old wash-house, and also little garden spots right in the midst of town, where he raises lettuce, radishes, onions and all that sort of thing, for which he finds ready sale, and smokes his opium in peace and contentment. In this connection I notice a sad item in a local report among the recent telegrams from New York. Being ambitious to achieve distinction as a detective, like other of his tribe in Boston and elsewhere in the East have done, sometimes, he quietly frequented the Chinese quarter, and made a moral wreck of himself, smoking in an opium den, having to put up four bits each time, in order that he might lodge a complaint, and have the Celestial wretches arrested for violation of the opium smoking law recently enacted. He achieved more success than either credit and renown, for after the arrest was made it was discovered that the new law had not yet gone into force and effect. He made a lively local item, but it cost him about $17, besides the loss of what little reputation he had. Austin reporters smoke nothing but two-bit cigars, and are innocent of opium den or other heathen practices.</p><p>GOD AND MAMMON.</p><p>Austin can support one Catholic and one Protestant clergyman tolerably well. There is a fine lead of wickedness for them to chloride about upon, with regular profit and no big pay streaks, but a third preacher seems to be one more than there is coin support for. Another has been engaged to fill the vacant parsonship of the Episcopal Church, but some of the leading members openly declare that they don’t think the fun pays for the powder, so to speak. They would rather go to the Methodist Church instead of having to work up a reluctant support for another preacher, who is liable not to be happy therein. Preachers are said to be scarcer and not so easily obtainable as they used to be. A very good reason is that they are not so willingly and well supported as they used to be. ""Ye cannot serve both God and Mammon"" are holy words which do not hold good in their case, for in professionally serving God they have to look to Mammon for substantial support. Gold Hill, you know, starved out all her Protestant preachers, and literally starved one to death. The poor fellow served God ambitiously till Mammon failed to back him up, when he fell down and died of hunger and a broken heart.</p><p>NEW LOCATIONS.</p><p>The old prospector is never idle, but always looking for new discoveries of rich chloride and good ore veins. The hills and mountains in this district have been pretty well searched, yet new discoveries and locations are still occasionally being made. One was found a few days ago down near the public cemetery, in the edge of the valley, half a mile or so below the town. Some rich float has occasionally been found there in years past, but the lead it belonged to has only now been definitely traced and secured. The vein is but a few inches thick, but it is rich and worth having. Being so near the graveyard the old prospectors who found it can work it with a grim satisfaction in knowing that their last ditch is before them, and that they have a dead thing on ultimate success.</p><p>GONE WEST.</p><p>Colonel Charley, together with his squaw, Susan, and their handsome, black-eyed daughter, Hattie, have left Austin and gone westward to enjoy the fandangos and festivities of the Piutes of Walker River and elsewhere in that direction. In case they should visit Virginia again be kind to them, critically observe Hattie's large, beautiful eyes, and give old Charley a new coat. He needs one—also pants and a respectable hat.       ALF.

TE18,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….June 24, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Climatic Impulsiveness—Young Reese River Cyclones—Base Ball Speculations and Deductions—Independence Day and Pioneer Patriotism—Reese River in Cold Chunks—Unique Bath—A $10,000 Suit—Of Clothes—Smelting and Milling—Bricks—Jonas Seely’s Sad Ending.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., June 22, 1883.</p><p>Nothing can be more legitimate than hot weather in the proper time and season of it, but the only difficulty is to define and satisfactorily apportion the various contingencies thereof. Here in Austin the weather is totally different from anywhere else on the surface of the globe. It is an impulsive climate. The old pioneer, who always knows it all, swears that he could always bet on the weather in California; that if [it] blew there three days in succession, from the southwest, it was the deadest thing in the world on a big rain, or anyhow a decent storm, but he can’t do it here. A week of snow storms may be succeeded by six weeks of red-hot weather, with chances in favor of about six weeks more of the same sort, without over five degrees variation, and then a disgusting lot of early Spring and late Fall weather. But the most impulsive variety of weather here is the cloudburst. On the impulse of the moment a seven weeks’ siege of red-hot weather may change to the roughest kind of a cloud-burst, flooding the whole district and washing away buildings, mules or anything else what happens to get in the way. Twice the central part of Austin has been thus suddenly and unexpectedly swept by huge floods of rain water pouring and surging down Main street, carrying away, on one occasion, the Postoffice, the Reveille office and other buildings, beside any amount of sidewalks, awnings and other similarly moveable property. For years the prudent old residents have been on the lookout for another cloud-burst flood, but it does not come. But it will—sometime when least expected.</p><p>YOUTHFUL CYCLONES.</p><p>Reese River Valley is the home of the cyclone. Most any day half a dozen of them can be seen slowly and majestically waltzing about over the sagebrush plain. These whirling columns of dust spontaneously and impulsively arise, and sometimes can be seen for hours whirling hundreds of feet in the air, never interfering with each other and doing no material damage. Occasionally one more enterprising or aggressive than the rest will come sweeping up the canyon and across a portion of Austin, creating a smart temporary commotion among loose boards, shingles, paper and dust. When one of them passes up Main street everybody knows it, and there is a lively slamming of doors until it has passed on its way over the Toiyabe range into Smoky Valley. Untold millions of them have thus gone over there, never to return. As before remarked, they are harmless; but then the country is new and these cyclones are young. A few hundred years hence, when they shall have attained age and strength, perhaps Austin may be totally obliterated by them, and they may be more feared than the cloudburst floods are now.</p><p>BASE BALL.</p><p>The recent base-ball fever has ingloriously subsided. Our boys went to Eureka and got scooped. Then the Eureka boys came over here, and at the big Miners’ Union picnic, last Saturday, they gave our boys another walloping, finishing up next day by genteelly beating them for the third time. Then they quietly and unostentatiously returned to Eureka. That Sunday game was well attended, a special train taking everybody, church members and all, down into the valley for the purpose. What would this Nation be without the noble game of base ball? Where should we look for our rising American statesmen, talented preachers, politicians, demagogues, and great men generally, were there no base ballers? Look at the brains, manly energy and grand ambition expended in the ennobling game of base ball! Verily without it this world would be a stupid blank and life not worth living. Even the wild, untutored Piutes and Shoshones are rapidly yielding to its civilizing influence, and several of them came home from the picnic howling drunk.</p><p>PATRIOTIC.</p><p>As the glorious Fourth approaches a patriotic American sentiment wells forth more and more upon the sagebrush breezes of Eastern Nevada, and preparations are being made to properly celebrate that proud national day. Here in Austin a lot of money has been raised, the orator and other requisites selected, and we shall have a great time, winding up at night with the regular annual ball of the old stiffs—the society of Reese River Pioneers. When it comes to honest American patriotism the old boys are all there. The men who marched in the front rank, and braved all danger and privations in the frontier development of the country, are the truest patriots to-day, and the most reliable and consistent lovers of their proud American Republic. They can’t play base-ball, but at a picnic or a ball where there are ladies and fiddles and dancing the gallant old pioneer is right at home. By the way, I notice that your Committee of Arrangements for the celebration of the Fourth at Virginia have secured George H. Morrison and W. G. Hyde, both of Gold Hill, as orator and poet. Gold Hill could always be relied upon to stand in on that proud occasion, even though she celebrated by herself independently of Virginia, something she does not seem disposed to do any more since the consolidation.</p><p>SELLING REESE RIVER.</p><p>Last Winter, when Reese river was frozen solid, two opposition ice dealers cut it up and hauled it to town. Now they are actively peddling it out at a cent a pound, and have enough to last till the next freeze. Meanwhile the springs thawed, the catfish and suckers crawled out of the mud, and the river is as good as ever. Being about six miles from town, when an Austinite concludes to take a bath in Reese river he buys a chunk of it, thaws it out, lies down and rolls over in it, and with a little effort of the imagination as to sagebrush and mosquitos he easily realizes that he is taking a genuine river bath. By using it over a time or two the realization becomes still more complete.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>When a mine is not considered worth quarreling about, its owners or claimants do not make themselves prominent, but just let an old location be suddenly discovered to be rich, or if it happens to be sold for a good price plenty of owners can be found willing to come in for a ""divvy."" So it is now with the old Breen mine, near here, which was recently sold for $20,000. A year or two ago a tailor reluctantly took a deed for one-half of the mine in payment for a cheap suit of clothes, and now he wants half of that coin. But new smelting furnace at Battle Mountain is nearing completion, and great expectations are being indulged in with regard to its capabilities for reducing the ores from this section. Being nearly 100 miles from Austin, however, the item of transportation is liable to interfere detrimentally against the mines of this immediate vicinity. Owners of some of the richer base metal mines, the ores of which cannot be profitably worked by regular mill process, signify their intention of trying the new smelting works by and by. Meanwhile the old Manhattan mill keeps pounding away right straight along, and making its almost daily shipment of ten bars a day, worth $1,000 each. The mines also continue their regular yield, with plenty of ore in sight, bidding fair to keep the mill supplies for some months yet.</p><p>A SAD ENDING.</p><p>The news of Jonas Seely’s death came very sudden and unexpected to his friends in this section, although he was sick when he left here for his home in Oakland, California. The first part of last November Seely came from Denver and visited the Twin River mine, of which he was the principal owner, situated in Ophir Canyon, some fifty miles to the southward from here. He was on his way to Oakland, where he said he would make a home for his family and settle down in peace and comfort the rest of his life. He said he had done well at his profession as a lawyer in Denver, and had amassed an ample fortune, upon which he was satisfied to retire and enjoy life during the remainder of his days. He looked hopeful, fat and happy, and the old light beamed in his eye that we all remember in the early days of the Comstock, when Seely was prominent in the community. On the 23d of last month he came again and went out to visit his mine. He returned on the 31st, and that evening I visited him at his room in the hotel. He seemed very much depressed, and said he was sick. He made no complaint regarding his mine or his business affairs generally, but was evidently suffering from fatigue and decidedly ill-health. His face was pale and haggard, with a wan and weary expression, and he seemed hardly able to be out of bed. He said he should leave for Oakland by the morning train, but at my earnest solicitation he concluded to lay over for a day and rest, leaving on the morning of June 2, still seriously ill. He arrived at his home in Oakland, and died on the 15th instant. It does seem hard for a man to battle through long years in the worldly strife for competence and comfortable, pleasant home, to which he has looked forward as a haven of rest and peace, wherein to happily end his days, and thus, at the last, have so few days to enjoy the long-coveted prize. It is certainly a sad, unsatisfactory ending.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE18.jpg,territorial

The laziest man felt a moral consolation in gazing at the elevated mercury, and as he swabbed the sweat from his reeking brown, remarked to the wickedest man that this was a little the goldurnedest weather ever he struck. And the wickedest man replied that it was cool as frozen cucumbers to the way they were having it in Battle Mountain, Elko or Hades. The Piute chieftains dress exclusively in linen dusters, while their more unfashionable white brothers go in their shirt-sleeves or wear their Winter coats. The ladies all wear their Winter dresses, hats and all, when they appear on the streets. Nobody looks for a change in the weather before next Fall, unless there should be a cloudburst and a flood in August, by way of variety.</p><p>THE COOLEST PLACE</p><p>Now is underground; down in the mines. These mines are not so hot as those of the Comstock, by any means. They are not one-fourth as deep, and being connected throughout the honey-combed bosom of old Lander Hill, the air is free and pure, with good draughts in all directions. The average temperature in Winter is between fifty and sixty degrees, and, in Summer it runs as high as eighty, being of course regulated to a very considerable extent by the air from the surface. The formation is different from that of the Comstock, showing no indication or probabilities of any such extreme degree of heat as exists in the lower region of those mines when these shall have attained a similar depth. By the way, a brief sketch of the principal mines and mining operations at this point would not be uninteresting.</p><p>THE MINES OF AUSTIN,</p><p>Or Reese River District, were principally discovered in 1862-63. The pony express riders on the old overland stage route took a short cut up through the canyon where Austin now is, a couple of miles to the south of the stage road, in crossing the Toiyabe range, and one of them discovered and located the first ledge, near the mouth of the canyon. This was named the Pony Express, and subsequently yielded considerable good ore, but being eclipsed by its richer neighbors, it fell into disrepute and neglect years ago. This canyon naturally received the name of Pony canyon. John Frost, then an enterprising hotel landlord where the stage road crossed the Sierra Nevada, followed suit in December, 1862, by coming and making the first location on Lander Hill. He located the Oregon, North Star and other famous ledges, right in the midst of what are now the principal mines, and may be fairly considered as the first practical locator of the Reese river mines proper. Other locations followed, and the great Reese river excitement is a matter of history. These mines are situated along the southerly slope of Lander Hill, within the upper borders of Austin, like the Comstock in Virginia City, and form a portion of a broad ore belt or series of small ledges extending for several miles in a direction east of north and west of south—in fact, almost northeast and southwest. Outside of Lander Hill, however, there are no producing mines of note in the immediate vicinity of Austin, except those of Yankee Blade, three or four miles north, and the Breen mine, down nearer the edge of the valley. The Breen is not yielding much at present, and only about ten tons per week of high-grade ore is the average yield from the Patriot and two or three other mines at Yankee Blade. These last mentioned mines possess the same general characteristics as those of Austin, and yield higher grade ore, but they are much troubled with water, and their development materially retarded. In fact, the whole range for miles in extent seems to abound in these small ore veins. Some of them contain rich pockets or deposits of ore, and there is no rule for their discovery; they are simply where you find them.</p><p>THE MANHATTAN GROUP</p><p>Comprises the mines of Lander Hill, here in Austin, and which are principally owned by the Manhattan Silver Mining Company.  This group, or system of mines, is comprised within the extent of from half a mile to a mile square and is a perfect bee hive of mining industry. They have eight sets of works in active use for hoisting and otherwise promoting the underground working, and these works are of the most effective and substantial pattern, like those of the old Comstock, those of the Lander shaft and the Paxton incline being the chief representative, and really models of good workmanship. Indeed, as for that matter, there is no excuse for anything else, for at the foundry and machine shops of the company, which are near at hand, anything required in the shape of machinery is turned out at short notice, and inferior to nothing this side of San Francisco. At one of the works two Burleigh air compressors are in constant operation supplying the motive power to four donkey engines underground, employed in sinking, pumping, etc. None of the workings of these mines extend below the depth of 800 feet; in fact, most of the workings are about the 600 level. The Lander shaft is the only deep perpendicular shaft. It is 1,000 feet deep, but the lower portion of it not being needed, is reserved for future reference and deeper mining requirements. The Paxton incline is 1,500 feet in length, following the dip of that ledge at a grade or inclination of twenty-two degrees. It shows a fine, rich ledge in its face and at other points. The general dip of these ore veins is considerably flatter than that of the Comstock, being from twenty to thirty-five degrees. And most decidedly these mines are full of</p><p>ORE VEIN ECCENTRICITIES.</p><p>As before remarked, the veins are small, from three to six inches wide, occasionally bunching out to a foot or two in width, but they are condensedly rich, the ore, as worked in the mill of the company, which is near at hand, averaging from $250 to $300, or thereabout, per ton. It is essentially silver ore, carrying little or no gold. It contains antimony, iron, copper and other metals of the base sort, but is successfully worked by the dry crushing, Stedefeldt process. The mill works less than thirty tons per day on the average, and it keeps the mines working very lively to supply that amount of ore. In fact this cannot always be done, and the mill has had to lie idle for months at a time waiting for a good accumulation of ore. There are thirty or forty of these little ore veins, more or less, which have been worked from the surface down to the 600 level, and they are all the way from 20 to 300 feet apart, the general country rock between and around being granite or gneiss. They were composed largely of chloride in their surface workings, but changed to sulphuret as the water level was reached. The water is easily handled by the pumping and draining arrangements. But the chief eccentricity of these little veins consists in the</p><p>""BREAKS.""</p><p>Not one of these veins has been followed downward without a break. This is evidently owing to the fact that the whole surface or side of Lander Hill has been disturbed, bodily broken, and slid to the southward and west through some overpowering influence in its internal economy, thus causing very abrupt breaks in the continuity of the general vein formation of its bodily make-up. These breaks are more frequent and demoralizing near the surface than in the deeper workings. A section of the vein may be followed for 40 or even 300 feet in sinking, but then must come a break. At once a drift eastward is started, and sooner or later, perhaps in 20 or 300 feet, the other portion of the vein will be found. Thus the old, original veins have been followed from the surface down through frequent breaks without losing their identity. When a bonanza on the Comstock peters out there is no rule for finding any more of it, but here it is ""go east, young man."" It pays to do so.</p><p>TRIBUTERS.</p><p>The uncertainty thus attending the following of the veins, and the large amount of ""dead work"" involved in hunting for the breaks or lost portions, gradually induces the adoption of the tribute system, so common in the old country. Tributers are allowed to work certain vein sections for a certain portion of the ore or bullion result. Many old miners prefer this to regular day’s pay. Some of them thus work for year without realizing a cent, while some lucky ones who strike a ""good pitch"" clean up hundreds, and even thousands of dollars in a very short time. One or 200 men are probably working on that same layout in these mines to-day, the Manhattan Company furnishing them the requisite tools, powder and all other working facilities, and even supplies of food.</p><p>BENEFICIAL.</p><p>Probably 600 men are kept constantly employed by the company, either on the pay-roll or ""on tribute,"" and the system adopted has been of permanent benefit. As a real matter of fact the company directly or indirectly supports and maintains the entire town. Yet there are numerous men who roundly abuse the Manhattan Company, although they cannot very lucidly and logically explain why they do so. They simply like to on general principles.</p><p>IMPROVEMENTS.</p><p>Encouraged doubtless by the present long-continued and lucrative run of the mill, the Manhattan Company have had a plank floor laid in their machine-shop, and treated their dilapidated old office to a new coat of whitewash inside. Chief clerk Farrell has also got him a new coat, and everything looks prosperous, and the tributers and dump pickers are hurrying in small lots of ore to the mill in order to get a little money with which to properly celebrate</p><p>THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.</p><p>All the stores and business houses will close at 8 o'clock A. M. on that festive day, and everybody proposes joining in the grand celebration. Austin has not celebrated for three or four years, and she is going to do it up brown this time. John Frost, the old locator of the mines, has been unanimously chosen for Grand Marshal, and is out daily practicing on horseback, in order to get a toney Napoleonic style onto his saddle appearance; the music and the powder and fireworks are all engaged, plenty of money is raised for all purposes, and if Austin does not have a snorting old celebration it will be because there is some unaccountable miscue somewhere.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE19.jpg,territorial

That proud National day has been celebrated here in good style many times, but never quite equal to this time. Our mining and other interests have shown increased prosperity and promise during the past year, therefore a better feeling and desire to celebrate on this occasion was the natural result. Many people were in from the ranches and neighboring mining camps, and for the time our little old town did look right lively. Austin is rather of a pretty place for this section, and added to the green shade trees and shrubbery about the private residences were extensive rows of young pines and cottonwoods ranged liberally all along each side of the main street, every awning post being thus adorned. Flags fluttered in affluent abundance, Comstock style, and when you come to firecrackers, bombs and similar heathen explosives, here’s where we had them. The various fancy goods dealers had laid in unreasonably heavy supplies of these things, yet fell short after all in supplying the demand. All the previous night, and all the day celebrated, there was an incessant rattle and fizz. Cannon firing National salutes added to the general rumble and roar, and the pouring rain of firecrackers, until the air was thick and heavy with the stench of villainous gunpowder, and noisy dynamite patriotically destroyed, and a cloud obscured Reese River Valley all next day. Firecracker popping was never more popular. And the Chinese were only too glad of a pretext for turning things loose, and the way they did fumigate the filth, and blow out the stench of their quarter, was perfectly refreshing, after the style of your old grandmother burning a rag in a room where there is a bad smell.</p><p>MUSICAL.</p><p>As I have before remarked, there is plenty of musical talent in Austin. Every other man is a singer or an instrumental musician, and it was here that Emma Nevada developed her wonderful powers as a singer and went forth to conquer the operatic European world. We have two brass bands, two string bands, and material for half a dozen more bands if required. The Chinese band has a new instrument introduced into it; a sort of cross between a hewgag and an insane tom cat, and the old Confucius who runs it tried to ring the changes on it on the Fourth, but had too much opium and rice brandy in him. The band got on the porch of the little Chinese temple, however, and played all day. There are three shifts in the band, consequently no let up after they start in. The drummer is a whole corps in himself, and a perfect stem-winder. The others may stop to drink, smoke or eat, but he, never. He is the most exasperatingly persistent wretch in the world, and all the neighbors would be serenely happy if the drummer law was rigidly enforced in his case. And these Chinese outshone everybody else in the matter of flags on the Fourth. The big red dragon flag and several long streamers floated from the pole of their temple, surmounted with a big square green banner. It looked some like a Chinese war junk under full sail.</p><p>A PROCESSION NOVELTY.</p><p>Our Fourth of July procession was not quite as long as the generality of yours on the Comstock, there being only about 600 in line, including the Miners’ Union, civil societies, military, firemen, children and citizens generally. But it contained one very novel and effective feature—it was probably the only procession in the United States where the Car of State was drawn by a locomotive. The grade of the railroad which passes up through the main street of the town from the depot of the Nevada Central, is twelve and one-half feet to the hundred (not one foot in eight, as has been incorrectly stated), and being on the natural route of the procession, the locomotive and cars were utilized to most excellent and peculiarly effective advantage. Only two cars were used. These were flats, fitted up with awnings, etc., one for the Car of State and the other for children generally. The States were represented by the prettiest little girls in town, appropriately dressed, Miss Maggie Burchfield personating the Goddess of Liberty most angelically and tastefully. All went smooth and easy enough going down the steep grade, the brakes being in very competent and responsible hands, but many mechanically appreciative individuals were curious to see how it would be in coming up—whether the speed could be regulated to the pace of the procession marching before and behind. But that gallant little motor, weighing 33,000 pounds, just worked its way up the steepest plain railroad in the country slowly, carefully, with the precision of clockwork, and regulated exactly to the gait of the procession. There was no difficulty whatever about it. You doubtless had numerous Indians in your procession, but our one engine could certainly have got away with all of yours.</p><p>INCIDENTAL.</p><p>The exercises were first-rate throughout, with the exception of the poem, and the oration of Dr. Hammond could not be beaten anywhere, neither in matter nor style of delivery. Judge McKenney, as President of the Day, had a tough little episode in his opening remarks. Just as he commenced, a huge lot of firecrackers were tumbled into the street a short distance below the stand and made a tremendous racket. The Judge faced the music, however, most unflinchingly. He could not hear himself talk, but knew he was talking. It was nip and tuck for awhile, but he finally outwinded the crackers, and made some of his remarks heard. The hoodlum turnout and procession in the afternoon was very funny, and many, especially the youngsters, considered it the best part of the celebration. The Goddess had a quartz wagon all to herself, and it took two yoke of oxen to haul the big gun. Those oxen came across the plains in ’49, and never can look any older.</p><p>THE PIONEERS’ BALL.</p><p>The festivities were not marred by any disagreeable incidents; everything was excellently managed, and the ball given by the Society of Reese River Pioneers, at International Hall, in the evening, was well attended. They give a ball every year—not for profit, but merely as annual landmarks along down the banks of the River Time, recording their progress as they drift down stream toward the broad sea of eternity. And these balls are annual tests of endurance, correctly indicating how the natural powers of the old stiffs are holding out. One by one they fail to step out on the floor when the dance is called and the fiddles sound, and those who yet continue to respond are not as limber in the knees and ankles as they used to be. But they can lie just as hard as ever when they expatiate to you about what splendid dancers they used to be; the way they did the double shuffle, sailors’ hornpipe and all that sort of thing. Their double shuffle was done with cards principally, and their hornpipe was more like a tobacco pipe. It’s comical sometimes to hear one of these bald-headed old reprobates tell about how he danced the Highland Fling, when we know all the time that he never even saw it, except from the orchestra seats of a melodeon. One of them at this ball, after telling me a lot of yarns about his former dancing achievement, got on the floor with the prettiest young lady in the hall, having the vanity to think he could work through a plain quadrille. He got caught out, though, on the first turn, and retired in confusion. “No use,” remarked the old rooster, apologetically, “the music and the figgers is altogether different to what they used to be. Hard to keep run of ‘em.” The “Rheumatics” also interferes with some of these old boys in their terpsichorean efforts. Bill Ford and Ed. Allen are the best dancers among these Pioneers. There is a sharp rivalry between them. Allen does the pigeon-wing very neatly, but Ford stands him off with his chloride jig.</p><p>DOG POISONING.</p><p>The other morning one of the finest dogs in Austin laid down and died from eating a bit of poisoned meat he had found somewhere. His master has always tried to secure him against anything of the kind, buying the best of meat for him, keeping him well fed, and putting a muzzle on him whenever he thought there was any special danger. A year ago another very valuable, much prized dog, belonging to J.A. Wright, formerly of your city, went the same way. In neither of these cases was it supposed that the poisoning was intentional. The way of it is, somebody, recklessly and meanly, puts out poison to kill offensive cats and the dogs get it, or some blunder-headed humanitarian concludes to wipe out a few dozen of the surplus curs. But the miserable curs, not having sense enough to find the meat prepared for them, escape, while fine blooded dogs, with keener scent, are most liable to pick up the poison and experience the result. The dog poisoner is never found, but the dogs evidently find the poison. The only way to avoid thus losing your valuable, dearly beloved dog, and consequent broken-heartedness in the family, is not to own any dog.           ALF.

TE21,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Tuesday……….July 17, 1883</p><p>Entered at the Postoffice at Virginia City, Nevada, as second-class matter.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>The Hot Wave—Austin Timber Resources—Veins Without a Mother—Some Outside Mines and Ore Working—The Leaching of Silver—A Sad Episode—Journalistic Improvements—A Bad Break and Disgraceful Tumble.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., July 13, 1883.</p><p>The sun’s great hot eye still continues to glower scorchingly down upon the numerous sinners of Eastern Nevada, and what few saints there are of us are losing patience, and getting heated into a grievous state of exasperation. The average thermometer has got permanently gaited to about ninety degrees in the shade, and bids fair to stand at that for the next two months. The long-continued drought is beginning to tell severely upon the crops, especially grain, and the hay will not turn out as well as was expected. Even the suckers and catfish in Reese river have cause for alarm, for there may not be enough of that famous stream left next Winter to freeze ice for a cocktail.</p><p>TMBER.</p><p>According to the veracious traditions of the Reese River Pioneers the hillsides and canyons in and around Austin were originally well wooded with nut pine and cedar, but it is certain that no such desirable condition exists here at present. Ranchers and fuel dealers haul wood from far-off localities among the mountain fatnesses, and the cars bring numerous cords daily from away down along the railroad somewhere, but the native woods of Austin disappeared and their roots were dug up long ago. In proof of their assertion that some kind of timber once grew here, the old Pioneers triumphantly point at a cedar which stands in John Booth’s back yard, carefully fenced and preserved. This giant of the forest is ten feet high, six inches in diameter, and it wears a hump-backed, bandy-legged look, suggestive of extreme old age. Its foliage consists of a moppy bunch of green, which throws about shade enough for two beetles and a grasshopper to hold a picnic in, but it is an indisputably genuine relic of past timber probabilities, and entitled to proper reverence as such. As a contrast to the numerous locust, poplar and other varieties of shade trees and ornamental shrubbery growing so thriftily throughout the town it is peculiarly interesting. Booth would not take $1,000 for it.</p><p>THE MOTHER VEIN.</p><p>In a former letter I made descriptive and elaborate mention of the numerous small, but rich silver veins forming the famous and steadily productive mines of this locality. They permeate the country formation for miles in extent, and have been worked in the body of the mines, to the depth of 600 or 800 feet. Their general direction, dip and uniformity of character suggest the idea that way down in the deep levels of the world they may concentrate and come into one main mother vein; in fact, a grandmother vein, so to speak. There is nothing at all unreasonable in the proposition, and it certainly would be a very desirable arrangement. With so many exceedingly rich branches it surely should be a wonderfully affluent bonanza with untold billions of bullion in it. Every rusty old pioneer has always had full faith in the existence of this mythical mother vein; it fact, is willing to swear to it over four fingers of beverage on any proud occasion. What are veins without a mother? The very idea of so many rich little veins being simply branches from one parent stem is a gorgeous possibility, but the probabilities and chances that any of the present generation will ever arrive at the root and solve the problem as bona fide stockholders in this very desirable mother vein, are, to say the least, extremely problematical.</p><p>JEFFERSON MINES.</p><p>Away south, about seventy-five miles from here, are the mines of Jefferson Canyon. They were discovered in 1866, and have yielded richly at various times since. The bullion contains more or less gold, but not enough to disturb their integrity as silver mines. The ledges are large and well defined traceable for miles, there are two of them, running parallel in a northerly and southerly direction, but which is the father or which is the mother vein is not yet decided. Some very rich chimneys of ore have been developed and worked in them in times past, and Jefferson has contained quite an extensive and lively population; but through mismanagement and other adverse circumstances the mines gradually fell into disrepute, and now comparatively little work is being done there. Two mills—the Jefferson, of fourteen tamps, and the Prussian, ten stamps—were erected there; but both are lying idle at present. E. S. Goodrich, representing Minnesota capital, has several of the mines bonded at strong figures, and for some months past has been running the Jefferson mill with good results, making frequent shipments of bullion. He says he shall start up the mill again in a few days. Charles Kanrohat, chief proprietor of the Union mine, on the main Jefferson ledge, is now in Austin, having brought in a small lot of four tons of ore in order to test its working by the process used at the Manhattan mill. The ore is of a strong reddish cast, of a free milling character, containing a small proportion of gold, and is rich in horn silver. The bullion yield runs up into the hundreds, and with suitable works near the mine it should pay well. There are, evidently, millions in it, and the only trouble is to get it out properly. He says he shall now construct an arastra and adopt the leaching process. The ores of Jefferson comprise horn silver, black antimonial and ruby silver, sulphuret and chloride forms of silver and more or less gold. The ledges vary from three to thirty feet in width, dip east, and have been worked to the depth of 700 feet. Owing to the strong flow of water encountered deeper working will involve the employment of considerable capital, but there is enough good ore in the upper workings to keep practical mining men and bullion producers busy for years.</p><p>LEACHING.</p><p>At Belmont, between here and Jefferson, the trouble has been to find the proper process for working the ores to the best advantage. The conclusion has been arrived at that the leaching process is the best, and the one to be adopted. The principal mill in therefore about to be changed to a leaching establishment, and the result will demonstrate itself before long. There are many mines and mining districts in this State languishing for the proper process for working their ores. Leeching has been sometimes advantageously resorted to in surgery, and perhaps the same may be said of the Leaching process in ore reduction.</p><p>A SAD EPISODE.</p><p>One of the saddest events in the youthful society element of Austin which has occurred for years was the sudden death of Eddie Rowe on Tuesday last. He was a robust, healthy young man of eighteen, son of James H. Rowe, late President of the Austin Miners’ Union, and employed himself in surface mining operations. He was a prominent member of the Junior Baseball Club, which went from here to a contest with the Eureka Baseball Club a few days ago, at which time he is said to have received a severe strain. He also contracted a bad cold, resulting in subsequent trouble at times. He participated actively, however, in the celebration of the Fourth, and danced among the gayest and happiest at the Pioneer ball in the evening. Subsequently he was attacked by a very decided obstruction, or strangulation, in his bowels, resulting speedily in death. He had plenty of medical attendance, and a surgical operation was proposed, but was not allowed, neither was a post-mortem examination allowed, therefore the actual cause of his death is not definitely understood. He was a most exemplary young man, and a general favorite, and the news of his sudden and most unexpected death spread general consternation, for when so promising a young man, in the full vigor of life and health, thus lies down and dies, all naturally wonder whose turn will be next. On his death-bed he called for his young friends and companions, bade them all a final adieu, coolly and calmly made his requests as to the arrangements for his funeral, designating the songs to be sung, the pall-bearers, order of procession, and other details. The funeral was very largely attended, and the numerous grief-stricken friends of Eddie Rowe will long remember the sad occasion.</p><p>ONE DAY EARLIER</p><p>The gratifying change in railroad and mail time gives us the ENTERPRISE one day earlier now throughout Eastern Nevada, we receiving it here in Austin only the next morning after its publication, instead of two mornings afterward. Thus we are precious little behind in the matter of latest and fullest telegrams, or anything else in the shape of news, from all parts of the State and the world, when we thus get hold of the ENTERPRISE. If your circulation is not many times increased forthwith throughout this section, it ought to be, for the price of the paper brings it within the means of everybody.</p><p>THE AUSTIN “DEMOCRAT”</p><p>Died last Tuesday a death which was not glorious, for it crawfished most wretchedly, abjectly and inconsistently on its death-bed. It pulled down its own colors, sat down on them and defiled them. It’s a filthy bird that befouls its own nest, and when the former friends and supporters of the Democrat read its valedictory obituary in its own columns they were sorry that the “sooner” had not died sooner. The old standard pioneer paper of Austin, the Reveille, now has the local journalistic field entirely to itself. The field is limited, and can only support the one paper anywhere near decently. The Reveille is a first-rate, well-managed paper, and well worthy of even more liberal support than it receives. A good local paper is always one of the best elements of success in behalf of any well-ordered, social and business community; and the people of Austin should not fail to substantially recognize that fact.</p><p>ALF.

TE22,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….July 22, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>Outraged Austinites in Nye County Jail—Some Interesting Items Concerning Ore Working by the Stedefeldt Process—Chlorination and Chloride—Pans and Quicksilver—Silver Bricks—Boilers and Steam Tubes—Model Workshops—A Very Complete Sort of an Establishment for Eastern Nevada.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., July 20, 1883.</p><p>A ponderous bit of sensational news comes from the headwaters of Reese river. Three of Austin’s best-known citizens have been caught out, bounced and outrageously dealt with. No blood has been shed as yet, but how much may be is merely a matter of time and quantity. The way of it is this: The other day the three prominent Austinites aforesaid—Allen, Mason and Craycroft—went on a hunting expedition up stream. They were well fitted out with beverage, grub, ammunition, fishing lines, fry-pans, blankets, and a nice two—horse outfit, and expected to have a continuous game feast for three weeks. They found suckers and trout enough in the river, but wild fowl and small game were not at all plenty. Unconsciously and innocently they strayed onward and upward, and got over the line into Nye county. Suddenly a force of armed men pounced upon them, and they found themselves in the hands of a Sheriff and posse, arrested on charge of violating the game law. Such an idea never struck them while they were within the borders of Lander county, but the vigilant officials of Nye saw and improved their opportunity. Our three hunters were ruthlessly dragged off to the bastille in Grantsville, and all their property, beverage and all, confiscated. At last accounts they were rigidly held in durance vile, and had sent here for some of their friends to bail them out. They are apparently in a bad scrape, but will doubtless be able to prove that with all their shooting they killed no wild game. If tame ducks and calf meat have really been found in their possession, however, they or their friends may be made to contribute heavily to the financial resources of Nye county. But they are all gentlemen of undoubted personal courage, and if they have been imposed upon by this matter, nothing but blood can wipe out the foul insult. Further intelligence from Grantsville Jail is anxiously looked for.</p><p>A BUSY INSTITUTION.</p><p>For nearly nine months the Manhattan mill has been running almost continuously, and the present run will be recorded s the longest it has ever made. Being the only working mill in the district, all the ore produced from the mines of Austin and vicinity are brought to it for reduction, and some lots even come from a considerable distance. Jefferson Canyon, for instance, seventy-five miles away. It is a dry-crushing, twenty-stamp mill, and works the ores by the Stedefeldt process. Each of the twenty stamps weighs 1,000 pounds, and strikes nearly 100 blows a minute, making the dust fly at an extremely lively rate. When so many separate lots of ore are brought in from the various mines and localities for working, a very complete and careful system is called into requisition to keep them separate from each other until they have got through the batteries. And this is done very effectually and satisfactorily. The twenty stamps are arranged in four batteries of five stamps each, working side by side, thus allowing four separate and distinct lots of ore to be milled at one and the same time, if required. By frequent sampling of the pulp, as it passes through the battery screens in the shape of a dry powder as fine as flour, the assay value of each separate lot is ascertained and its bullion yield determined. Thus each battery can be run on separate and independent lots of ore, or all four be employed on a single large lot. After passing the batteries, however, separate working cease, the pulp being carried forward collectively through the rest of the process.</p><p>CHLORINATION.</p><p>From the batteries the pulp passes forward to where a small two-stamp battery supplies it with pulverized salt, and it is mechanically mixed therewith to the extent of ten per cent., more or less, according to the richness of the ore, the richest ore requiring the most salt. Thence it passes through an elevator to the top of the chimney-like furnace, and these screens, mechanically moving past each other, allow the pulp to sift and drop evenly down through forty-eight feet of fire flame to the bottom. This is a decidedly hot fire, created by two charcoal furnaces, on opposite sides, near the base. The heaviest and principal portion of the pulp dropping down through this column of fire, experiences the chlorination process in so doing, and falls in a red hot pile at the bottom, changed from its sulphuret character to a chloride. Thence it is drawn or hoed out through a small door, every hour, for transfer to the pan and amalgamation department.</p><p>FLUE DUST.</p><p>Although, as before remarked, the heaviest and principal portion of the pulp drops to the bottom of the furnace, a considerable and valuable portion is carried elsewhere by the force and draught of the flaming furnace. The flue turns just beneath the pulp screen, at the top, and passes downward and backward through a series of dust chambers, contained in a substantial brick structure seventy feet long by sixteen wide and ten or twelve feet high. There are sixteen of these chambers or compartments, and the flame and head of the furnace, laden with light, rich ore dust, passes zigzag through the entire series, and thence through outside passages to a huge brick chimney eighty-five feet high, which finally carries the heat and smoke to join the general atmosphere, the distance thus intrisically traversed by it from the furnace being over 500 feet. This, of course, is to give the pulp a chance to settle. Through convenient doors in the dust chambers and passages the captured pulp is drawn out once a month and taken to the pans. And it furnishes the finest of the bullion. This Stedefeldt furnace was the second erected in the State, the first being at the Auburn mill, near Reno.</p><p>THE PAN DEPARTMENT.</p><p>From the furnace the chlorinated and chloridized pulp, after being cooled somewhat, is run on cars into the pan room near by. This department contains eight pans. With a settler to each. The pans are five feet in diameter by two and a half feet deep, and are simply plain pans with wooden sides and iron bottoms, and provided with the usual style of mullers, making sixty-eight revolutions a minute. The settlers are similar in style, six feet in diameter, with wooden mullers or agitators, making fifteen revolutions a minute. Each pan works a ton at a charge, occupying eight hours for each charge, or three charges every twenty-four hours. About 600 pounds of quicksilver are used to each charge, and even up to 1,000 or more in case the ore is unusually rich. More or less salt, as required, is also used in the pans, together with cyanide of potassium, scraps and borings of iron and other desirable chemical agents. The amalgam is all placed in a large and very substantial cast-iron strainer and the surplus quicksilver very speedily forced out of it by hydraulic pressure. The</p><p>RETORTING AND MELTING</p><p>Department, which adjoins the pan room, is very conveniently [illegible] and certainly gives very gratifying results. It contains three large retorts and two melting furnaces, and every day or two, according to the richness of the ore worked, turns out a shipment of ten nice bricks of silver bullion worth a thousand dollars each. Charles Durning is Superintendent of the mill, and has been for many years, having been an active and respected resident of Austin since 1864. It keeps him pretty busy looking out for the different departments of the institution under his charge, but he is fully equal to the task, and understands his business.</p><p>THE MOTIVE POWER</p><p>Running the entire mill, as well as furnishing power to some other outside arrangements, is supplied by one of the best and most effective steam engines in this section. It is a Putnam valve horizontal engine with eighteen-inch cylinder and forty-two-inch stroke, rated at 140 horse power. The fly wheel is eighteen feet in diameter, and weighs 14,000 pounds. This engine is from the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, and with its bed, eighteen feet long, must have been a very ponderous affair to freight over the Sierra and across the flats before the advent of the railroad. The boiler room contains three pairs of tubular boilers, two sets of them in constant use and the third kept in reserve. One very effective feature here consists in the recent adoption of six-inch upright columns of team pipes, nine on each side of the fire boxes or furnaces. These are connected with the boilers, and are of very important assistance in getting up steam. There is no trouble in getting up all the steam required, and more, too. A great saving of fuel is also effected. About seven cords of nutpine wood are burned daily. The Chief Engineer in charge of this department is Eph. Wagar, and he takes a very evident degree of pride in it.</p><p>THE MACHINE SHOPS.</p><p>The numerous mining works naturally created a demand for an establishment right here where repairing could be done and machinery made without having to send hundreds of miles for that purpose. The result was that from a small blacksmith shop the present extensive and very complete establishment has grown by frequent and judicious additions. It contains big forges, a steam hammer, lathes, planers, turning, drilling and sawing machines, all of the latest patterns and the most substantial description, and any work required can be turned out at short notice, from a six-foot hoisting reel to a big steam engine. Moreover, as has been before remarked, just as well finished and effective work can be turned out of these shops as from any establishment this side of San Francisco. A. E. Johnson is the master mechanic in charge of this department, and under his efficient supervision constant improvement is shown.</p><p>THE FOUNDRY,</p><p>Which is conveniently situated near by, is under the charge of James Lovell, a very competent and skillful workman. It is not so extensive as some of the San Francisco foundries, but what work it does turn out is first-class and fully up to the requirements. It was a good idea on the part of the Manhattan company to thus establish their own shops where they could do all their own work as required and make all necessary repairs instead of having to send so far away in case of accident or for any new work required. The necessities of the isolated situation, however, prompted the practical adoption of the idea.</p><p>OTHER DEPARTMENTS.</p><p>The assay office of the company, across the road from the mill, is properly furnished in all its details, and is engineered by Jacob Trolson, who also acts, when occasion requires, as surveyor in and about the mines. The main office of the company, also near the mill, is a very unpretentious structure, but a large amount of very responsible business is transacted therein. M. J. Farrell is chief clerk in charge and has been for numerous years. John Frost, the old original locator of the mines, still presides over them in the capacity of Superintendent of the machinery of the various works, both above and below ground, and is a very efficient man for that responsible position. The whole mines, mil, workshops and all connected with the Manhattan Company, are under the superintendence of Melville Curtis, a very wide awake sort of a gentleman. His work and success tells its own story.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE22.jpg,territorial

Each day the old Reese River Pioneer cocks his weather eye up at the troubled afternoon sky, and promisingly shakes his grizzled locks as he tells you about the terrible cloud burst and flood of August, ’78, which just swept Austin from head to foot. And all along Main street the store and saloon keepers get their little flood gates ready to place in their doorways to keep out any repetition of the aqueous-fluvial calamity which so detrimentally invaded their premises on that memorable occasion. The Johnny-come-latelies and tenderfeet, gazing philosophically upon the daily threatening sky, laugh scornfully at the few drops of rain reluctantly squeezed out, refuse to believe that there ever was any cloud burst here at all, and are willing to believe that the whole disastrous yarn is a diseased dream of the old R. R. P. aforesaid. And the old R. R. P. secretly hopes that a devil of a cloud burst will come soon, to vindicate his veracity and the honor of the town.</p><p>PREPARED AGAINST FIRE.</p><p>The people of Austin seem more careful as regards precautionary measures against conflagrations than anywhere else in the known world. Foul or defective stovepipes and chimneys create frequent fire alarms in all wide-awake communities, but not so here. Maybe the wood does not form any inflammable scale or soot, on the inside of the stovepipes, or the people themselves do not feel able to afford the luxury of being burned out, and therefore are more careful than the people of other communities. Our Volunteer Fire Department is well organized, and prepared ready for a rush at the first tap or toot of a fire alarm, but for nearly three years past not so much as a China wash-house or a Summer kitchen has called for the hose-carts to roll. There are plenty of hydrants advantageously distributed, plenty of good hose, plenty of water and plenty of active and experienced firemen, but nothing in that line is ever needed any more. A fire at the Manhattan mill could easily prove an extremely serious disaster to the mining and all other interests of this place and section. The buildings, consisting of machine shops, foundry, coal house and other extensive buildings connected with the mill itself, would culminate in a huge mass of destruction, were it allowed a fair show to that effect. But ample preparations are made against any such disagreeable possibility. Four hydrants, of the most approved style, with the best of carbolized hose attached, or ready to attach, are placed at the most advantageous points. Under a pressure of 285 feet, from the tank or reservoir at the Oregon shaft, streams from these hydrants can be thrown over any of the buildings. A powerful steam pump, connected with the main engine of the mill, can also throw two heavy streams, if desired. Hose Company, No. 2, of the Austin Fire Department, also have their apparatus housed near by, ready to run at a moment’s warning. It would get the advantage, in face of all these precautionary and effective preparations.</p><p>GOOD ORE WORKING.</p><p>Owing to the great loss of sulphurets by the ordinary wet milling process, the mills of the Comstock have only assured the working of ore up to sixty-five or seventy per cent. of its assay value, the rest passing off in the tailings. Here, at the Manhattan mill, the dry crushing and Stedefeldt chlorination process works the ore up to a much more satisfactory figure, eighty and eighty-two per cent. of the assay value being allowed by the company for the ores milled. This chlorination process completely destroys all the sulphurets, converting the pulverized ore into chloride. In this state it readily yields up its silver, and the loss on the tailings, flue-dust, etc., is comparatively trifling. In fact the tailings are too poor to be considered of any value. About 600 tons a month is the regular working rate of the mill.</p><p>SOME RICH ORE.</p><p>The ore in some of the characteristically small veins of this district are concentratedly and remarkably rich. Two and three thousand dollars per ton is not at all uncommon. Among the richest was a lot of twenty or thirty tons from the Dollarhide mine in 1875, the first-class of which worked $5,050 per ton, and the second-class over $1,000 per ton. On the 30th of last month a small lot from Cassidy’s Homego mine, Yankee Blade, yielded at the rate of $5,000 per ton. About $250 or $300 per ton, however, are the average milling figures. Since the first discovery of the mines of this district, twenty years ago, down to the present time the total bullion yield has amounted to over $20,000,000. During the working management of the Manhattan Company, a period of sixteen years, the mill has turned out to date the handsome sum of $16,052,414 25, and it is still sending forth the clean silver bullion bricks at the rate of a million dollars a year. This represents the total yield of Reese River District. The present condition and prospects of the mines warrant a continuance of the same prosperous yield for years to come.</p><p>SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT.</p><p>Since the Manhattan Company has had the principal control and management of the mining situation here, substantial, well-grounded property has been the feature, and Austin still continues on a firm basis of general prosperity. Very few idle men are to be seen, regular standard mining wages are paid and things go along like clockwork. The company has paid dividends in times past, and perhaps may again in the sweet by and by, but considering the fact that these, unlike the Comstock, are purely silver mines, with no gold, it is pretty good to be able to square accounts liberally and keep going ahead all right. Especially so in the face of the long-continued twenty per cent. discount on silver, which would make a pretty good monthly dividend of itself. The cost of transportation to and from this isolated locality is no small item in the way of expense, but the main feature in practical mining operations here consists in sinking shafts and inclines, with competent surface works, at heavy expense, to reach and develop rich but very small ore veins which are unreliable in their general situation and character, and always calling for new and expensive explorations. A large proportion of the ores reduced at the mill are custom and tribute ores, and indeed had it not been for the adoption of the tribute system it is a question as to whether the mines generally might not have been a dead financial failure long ago. A large amount of dead work has constantly to be done, the management, very judiciously, while working present ore development, never failing to keep prospecting for more in the most promising direction. Moreover, a competent reserve fund has always to be kept on hand against occasional backsets and to tide over all adverse possibilities and contingencies. Thus it is that no assessments have to be levied, and present prosperity is more in favor of dividends than assessments. Few companies of any kind on the American continent are as systematically and judiciously managed, and operate as beneficially for the community amid which it exists.</p><p>DEMORALIZED TELEGRAPH.</p><p>The most disreputable institution in the country now is the Western Union Telegraph. The Associated Press dispatches were bad enough before, but since the great strike of the operators, they have become totally unreliable. Everybody used to remark what a liar the telegraph was, and now it necessarily has to subside into a helpless, hopeless state of moral mendacity, with nobody so poor as to do it reverence. Universal American sympathy is with the striking operators. Here in Austin we have only one, but he is a public object of interest, and we all sympathize with him. He is quiet and says nothing, which makes the public sympathy all the more intense. Should he conclude to send a blue streak of electro-dynamite through the wire and blow Jay Gould or any other bloated monopolist straight into the infernal regions, the people of Austin will unanimously applaud and indorse him.</p><p>INDIAN TROUBLES.</p><p>The Piutes residing on the hill-slopes, both sides of town, are in serious trouble. Bowel complaint, diphtheria, fever and other styles of sickness are among them, and they are losing quite a number, especially children, by death. The poor old medicine man has worked himself nearly to death, and howled himself hoarse, trying to cure or ward off these diseases, but now lies down and rolls in agonies of despair. They bury their dead and move their campoodies, but sickness and death follow them. Many are leaving for Humboldt and Walker as fast as the railroad will deadhead them through.</p><p>VINDICATED.</p><p>The three hunters from Austin, Allen, Mason and Craycroft, mentioned in my last letter as having been arrested and jailed in Grantsville, Nye county, for violation of the Game law, have got back to Austin. They got out of the scrape by special and ingenious diplomacy. The day their trial came up before the Justice of the Peace they went to $9 expense, and deliberately got every man in Grantsville, except the Sheriff and Justice, blind drunk. The witnesses for the prosecution magnanimously swore they didn’t know anything about the case, and the jury hilariously pronounced them ""puffeckly in (hic) scent,"" declaring that this arrest was an outrage on American civilization. Allen is going to run for Governor next time and considers Grantsville already canvassed in his favor. Anyhow he knows it will only cost $9 to canvass it again whenever he sees fit.</p><p>ALF.

He looks upon a lie as a rotten egg. George Washington might be able to hatch it out with his little hatchet, but he would disdain to even make the attempt. The Pioneer delights in frozen truths even in hot weather. Only yesterday Mr. Dadd, who arrived here among the earliest sufferers, and is a relative of Bill Dadd the Scribe, in the course of a conversation about the weather, informed me that notwithstanding the regular ninety degrees we have been sweltering under the last two months, and which state of heat is usual every Summer for several months at a time, ice is liable to form most any night. In fact, he says that over on Birch creek, a dozen miles from here, there is a big bluff of solid ice over a hundred feet high, which never thaws out. It is a prehistoric glacier which was there long before he arrived in the country. ""Why,"" said he, warming up with the subject, ""in August, '63, me and old Reese was a campin’ down on the river, where Birchim’s ranch is now, amongst the tules, and we found it mighty cold sleepin' under three pair o' double blankets. In fact, we found our coffee-pot skimmed over with ice every mornin', and it a settin' close by the fire. The coffee was all the clearer for it, howsomever.""</p><p>SICKNESS AND DEATH.</p><p>As stated in my last, the Piutes are in trouble. So many deaths have occurred among them of late, from diphtheria, bowel complaint, etc., that scores of them have left in search of a more healthy locality. There was a general exodus of them on Monday last from the hillside south of town, all packing up and leaving for Stillwater. They did not neglect to take along with them their howling doctor, which was a satisfactory circumstance. He did not want to go, for he knows they intend to drown and cremate him in case of any deaths continuing among them at Stillwater. Mrs. Cook’s old dog ""Bing,"" named after Bing Williams, the noted pugilist, died this morning from eating too much strychnine. Bing was as large and brave as a sheep, and his mistress admired him for his many noble qualities. He was death on cats, although he never caught or killed any. One cold, stormy night last Winter, old Bing got a couple of cats treed under the house. He couldn’t get in there, and they couldn’t get out, for Bing’s vigilant nose stopped the hole. They clawed a comfortable bed in the dirt, and snored the happy hours away, while poor watchful Bing laid out in the snow and nearly froze to death. Dear, faithful old dog, like a burned-out stove, or a cigar stump, as the newspapers always philosophically remark, when an old pioneer dies, ""Peace to his ashes.""  But may his canine ghost haunt the midnight dreams of his heartless poisoner.</p><p>BANDAGED  HEADS.</p><p>Speaking about prize-fighting, the few homely young ladies in Austin wear big bandages tied around their heads every day, and so do all the homeliest married women. Like prize-fighters after a battle, they wear bandages over the bangs on their foreheads. But they are not so belligerent and domestically quarrelsome as these bandages would indicate. They only wish to look pretty for an hour or two in the evening, so they tie up their heads and look viciously hideous all day. A blonde, or a red-haired woman, looks especially interesting with her head thus bundled up.</p><p>YANKEE BLADE ORE.</p><p>A dozen tons or more comes in every week to the Manhattan mill from the mines of Yankee Blade, three or four miles north of here. The ledges there are small, and possess the same general characteristics as these here in Austin, and they are of about the same degree of richness, but give better milling returns. The reason of this is that those mines are worked mostly by tributers and outside parties, who dress and sort their ore close in order to avoid extra cost of milling, transportation, etc. The principal mine is the Patriot, formerly the McCann, which shows a ledge six or eight inches wide, very rich in black antimonial and ruby silver. Ford & Johnson also have a little ledge of two or three inches, which skins out toward $1,000 a ton whenever they can manage to scrape out a ton. Jenkins' mine has a two or three inch ledge, which occasionally bulges out into a four or five inch bonanza, and his first-class ore mills over a thousand dollars per ton. But it takes a comparatively long time to extract a ton of ore from between its tough granite walls. To an old Comstocker, used to seeing hundreds of tons of ore handled daily, this reads ridiculously small, of course, but it must be borne in mind that these ore veins are exceedingly condensed. Each one of these rich little two to six inch veins equals a forty foot Comstocker, with the advantage of having less rock to handle, less timbering and far less expense generally. Pounds in the way of rick ore tell wonderfully sometimes in bullion results, particularly and notably in this section.</p><p>PULP POISONING.</p><p>The dry working, chlorination process of the Manhattan mill is rather tough in some respects on human lungs. Especially is this the case in the battery department, where the air is full of ore dust all the time. This pulverized quartz operates as a constant poison in its action upon the lungs, and slowly and surely lives have yielded to its effects during years past. The men employed wear a patent muzzle arrangement, breathing through a wet sponge, and have a peculiarly vicious, bulldog look to an outsider. Some lungs yield far more readily than others to the pulp dust. Some cannot stand it at all, while others stand this or any other department of the mill right straight along, without apparent detriment. Charley Durning, the Superintendent, who has been through all parts of the mill every day for the last sixteen years, shows no bad effects from it. James Robinson, the weigher and receiver, and general boss of the ore and battery room, has for a similar period inhaled tons upon tons of pulp with impunity, and as for James Sullivan, the oldest veteran of them all, he is only happy and comfortable amid clouds of chlorinated chloride from the furnace. He feels refreshed by his regular daily lung feed, grows younger on it, and outside the pure air has no nutriment in it for him any more. When he dies his corpse will assay $40,000 to the ton.</p><p>DUMP PICKING.</p><p>This is one of the peculiar industries of this locality, and furnishes employment to a large number of boys as well as men. In the mining or extraction of these small, rich ore veins, some of the ore is very liable to get among the waste rock and be dumped as such. Boys purchase or are given the privilege of canvassing the various dumps and looking out for any of these stray pieces of ore. They become very expert at it, and whenever a carload of waste is dumped they can detect at a glance any bit of good ore that comes rolling down. Men turn over old dumps for what good ore may have got astray in former times, and both men and boys pick over ore that has been cast away by those engaged in dressing or assorting it. All these dump-pickers find more or less lucrative employment at it. They bring their little lots of ore to the mill, and it yields from $150 to $500 to the ton, giving them $50 or $100 in the way of monthly wages. There is not so much chance, perhaps, for dump picking among the mines of the Comstock, yet even there we have seen many an industrious gentleman of Mexican or Spanish extraction making good wages picking about the croppings and old dumps, breaking and selecting rock with his little hammer. And some day, when dog-in-the-manger Superintendents or Directors will allow it, some of those ancient dumps will be turned over with profit to both mine-owners and dump-pickers.</p><p>AUSTIN’S FOUR KNIGHTS.</p><p>The Triennial Conclave of the Knights Templar, about to assemble in San Francisco, will be attended by many people from this section who desire to witness the grandest display of the kind that the Pacific Coast will be favored with in the nineteenth century. There are only four members of that knightly Order in Austin—Andrew Nicholls, J. R. Williamson, Henry Mayenbaum and Judge D. C. McKenney. How many of these four high-up Masonic gents will attend is not stated at present, but probably all will be ""thar."" Four better and more worthy resident members of this responsible community could not be selected.   ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE24.jpg,territorial
TE25,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Tuesday……….August 21, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Early Austin—The Mecca of Fortune Hunting Pilgrims—The Camels—Architectural and Statistical—Family Additions—Austin Comstockers—Autographic Album Atrocities—Choice Brook Trout—Old Sports—A Rich Strike and Waterbury Wind-up—Suggestive Statistics—Patience.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., August 17, 1883.</p><p>Like a properly constituted and well wound-up Waterbury watch, Austin continues to tick, roll and wag along with the rest of the world, and recent immigrant, especially those who [do] not believe in the historical cloudburst and flood of ’78 can hardly realize that twenty years ago Austin was the grand Mecca of the Pacific Coast, toward which fortune hunters rushed pell mell from all directions. Main street was blockaded with teams day and night, and there was hardly room for anybody to turn around. And among the features of the rushing pilgrimage, giving it a decidedly Mecca-ish appearance, is this recorded in M. J. Farrell’s address, delivered before the Society of Reese River Pioneers:</p><p>""I recollect the advent of the train of camels, and the crowds they attracted. They were hideously ugly, carried immense loads, and were engineered by a red-headed Oriental from county Cork. They were not impeded in their progress by blockades, as their presence as a terror to all the horse kind.""</p><p>Of course the numerous pack trains of mules and donkeys took to the sagebrush in demoralized dismay when these awful looking beasts came stalking along with rod strides, humping their huge loads high in the air and assuming a proscriptive right to the road through their unrivaled ugliness. It is not recorded that they made many trips across the deserts to this Mecca, for the other pilgrims were naturally inclined to ""mecca"" row about it. We all remember how these imported camels and dromedaries were ranched and cultivated by some French Arabs on Carson river, and were used to pack salt and fuel to Virginia City in the early days, and how an ordinance had to be passed against their coming into the city in the day time on account of the disastrous fright they gave to teams on the roads, and in fact all other living animals. It is a comfort to know that these ungainly, unprofitable beasts have permanent evacuated this section, and are now roasting their humps beneath the red hot skies of Arizona. They would scare anything but a street locomotive.</p><p>AUSTIN ARCHITECTURE.</p><p>When Mr. Farrell arrived here, in April, 1863, there was but one house—unfinished—and a few brush shanties, but in five months, he says, 366 houses were erected, not counting tents and shanties. Professor Silliman enthusiastically predicted that Austin would have a population of 50,000 in ten years, and during the Summer of ’63 Mr. Farrell estimates the population at 10,000, which was as far as Silliman’s prediction ever reached toward fulfillment. It has dwindled since to less than 3,000. When the excitement died out and the reaction took place, some of the retiring multitude took away their houses with them, especially those who resided in tents. But they could not take away any of the original stone, brick or adobe buildings, or those made of mud and brush, nor the solid little stockades and dug-outs. Thus it is that Austin today contains more queer little antiquated dwellings than any other town of its size and permanency on the Pacific Coast. Many of the little stockades, made of poles or small logs stood on end and the chinks mudded up, still remain, with their roofs of brush and mud, old tin cans, shakes, etc., although many of them have been done away with in the way of firewood, or utilized in the construction of more pretentious yet not more comfortable structures. There are some very neat granite and brick buildings in Austin for business and public purposes, and for real comfortable dwellings there are numerous ones of the brick and adobe order of architecture which cannot be beat. No new ones have been built for some time, as the old ones are good and sufficient. But a very appreciable feature consists in the numerous additions to the original was of mud, adobe or brick, but later, additions have been made, to accommodate additions to the family—one after the other extending the roof and spreading out until many a dwelling or family encampment resembles an old hen spreading herself, trying to set on an unusual number of eggs.</p><p>COMSTOCKERS.</p><p>As a large portion of the first population of Eastern Nevada came from the Comstock, so now Austin contains many an old Comstocker, and frequent additions come from that quarter. George Laity, a long time well known resident of Gold Hill arrived a day or two ago, and has gone to work in the mines. He sees plenty of far richer and prettier ore than he ever saw in his mining experience on the Comstock, but infinitely less of it. He has been down in Arizona, and other barbarous localities, but is willing to swear that Gold Hill, and the rest of the Comstock, is God’s country, and its people the best in the world. But he has not been in Austin long. Comstockers very naturally assimilate and affiliate with Austin above or below ground.</p><p>MORE ALBUMMERS.</p><p>The autographic album ruction has not died out yet. Every young lady of from fourteen to forty-five Summers has her album, and industriously tries to get it filled with the autographic emanations of her personal friends, and people of note about town. Among the most recent coming under my observation are the following specimens:</p><p>""Be kind to thy mother; she Loves the best</p><p>Of all other friends on this earth;</p><p>They father's the next best friend that thou has,</p><p>And Austin’s the place of thy birth.""</p><p>""When I am dead and in my grave,</p><p>And all my bones are rotten,</p><p>This little book will tell my name</p><p>When I am quiet forgotten.""</p><p>""Remember me when this you see,</p><p>And bare me in your</p><p>minde—that a friend in</p><p>need is few indeed, and</p><p>Seldom that you find.""</p><p>Oh, dear! Such dreadful taffy; such overweening vanity. The next Legislature should take this thing  in hand. The last one was not capable.</p><p>TROUT FISHING.</p><p>On both sides of this, the Toiyabe range, are several good creeks or mountain streams of water, flowing into Smoky and Reese River valleys, which are well stocked with the natural brook trout of the county. These desirable fish are from six to ten inches in length, streaked with a blush of red on their sides, and taste just as delicious as the Eastern brook trout. The other day two of our local fishing sports, J. A. Wright and D. B. Starrett, rode out to Big creek, some eight or ten miles, fished awhile, and then crossed the summit to Kingston canyon, where they struck a good lead of trout. Wright himself, who is the boss expert in that line, caught fifty-two trout in half an hour. They brought home part of a wagon load and treated their friends.</p><p>STRUCK IT.</p><p>Our mutual friend Spykens has struck a two-inch bonanza of $20,000 ore out at Yankee Blade, and is prosperous. He buys his whisky by the gallon now, instead of smuggling it home by the pocket flask, as formerly. His nose is assuming an aristocratic crushed huckleberry color, and he has treated himself to a Waterbury watch. Yet he is not happy. According to regular requirements it takes just two minutes in each twenty-four hours to wind up a Waterbury watch; one that will run. That amounts to twelve hours in the course of a year, or one day of his life every two years. He feels miserable as he contemplates how much time he is thus winding and wasting away in keeping that Waterbury time piece agoing, and actually shortening the number of his days. That watch cost him only about $3, right straight from the factory. It is the best time-keeper in the world, yet he sees that it is costing him a serious portion of his life. Every night, as he winds it up before going to bed, he gets nervous, and feels that he is simply and literally Patience on a picket fence winding up a Waterbury watch.

TE26,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….August 26, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>A Sage-Hen Deduction, and a Gold Hill Aquatic Proposition—A True Fish Story—The Grand Conclave at San Francisco—Austin’s Subclavian Portion of it—Some Explosive Beer—Impending Calamity—Nevada Beef—Butchers, Charity and True Benevolence.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., August 24, 1883.</p><p>""Now see here,"" said Mr. Dadd, last evening, ""here's a proposition I want explained. It’s a well-known and established fact that a sagehen hain’t got no gizzard, like other birds—nothing but a sort of maw; no gizzard at all. I’m an old hunter and know a sagehen from a grouse and a hawk from a hand-saw, but blow me if I can reconcile all the discrepancies of newspaper talk. In the last year or two the papers have been tellin’ about the mines of Gold Hill bein’ flooded with water fillin’ ‘em up over a thousand feet, and now the same papers say them same mines has to shut down from lack of water to mill the ore. How’s that?""</p><p>""Yes, but the water simply floods the lower levels, and the ore is all being taken from the old upper workings, near the surface. This ore has to be taken down to the mills on Carson River for reduction. The river is always low at this season, but is lower than usual at present. That’s what's the matter.""</p><p>""Haven’t they got any pumps in them mines?""</p><p>""Certainly; some of the finest and most powerful in the world are to be found in the hoisting works of the Comstock; pumps that are capable of raising a perfect deluge, and which can get that water out whenever the controlling managers see fit to have it done.""</p><p>""They can, hey; then why the devil don’t they just turn their hoistin' works into quartz mills, and so raise the water and mill the ore all at one lick?"" And the festive old Reese River pioneer gave a vigorous puff of his pipe, like a high-pressure Mississippi steamboat, as he wheeled around and strode off down street.</p><p>AN OLD FISH STORY.</p><p>How long fish may grow to be has been definitely ascertained and established long ago, but how long they may live has never been statistically represented and set down. The famous eyeless fish of the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, and elsewhere in subterranean waters are well enough in their way. They never required eyes, consequently were not provided with those useful appendages, so useful to the horse buyer and other stock dealers, but here in Austin we have fish, who, ""having eyes see not,"" and have not for the last sixteen years. Across the street from the Reveille office is a little old wooden building, bearing the pretentious sign legend of ""United States Bakery."" It never baked the United States, but in times past furnished bread for the Austin portion of the Republic. At the rear end of the bakery is a good sized tunnel excavation, about thirty feet in length, in the solid granite. It was made in the early days, and has been in use ever since, forming a very nice cool vault. In excavating this cellar or tunnel, near the back end or face, a small spring of pure cold water was struck, which flowed up through a crevice in the solid rock floor, and furnished a valuable supply for the bakery as well as for some of the neighbors. It has continued flowing ever since. A hole about three feet long, two wide and a foot deep, was made in the rock for the spring, which was kept covered with planks. Early in 1867 the proprietor one day procured a dozen small fish from Reese river, alive, and put them in this spring. They were of the red-streaked sucker variety, six or seven inches in length, and took very kindly to their quiet, dark little prison. This was sixteen years ago. Subsequently some died or were given away, and now only two are left. They still retain the same size, none of them having grown any longer, these two remaining being six or seven inches in length. There being no flies or any other species of insect in that cold, dark, closely shut spring, and no other food having ever been given them, these solitary confined little fish have merely subsisted on the clear running water, something which no other old Reese River Pioneer is able to brag of. There being rarely ever any occasion to remove the cover of the spring, hese little fish have never seen sunlight and scarcely even daylight for over sixteen tears. A new wooden boxing was put into the spring some four or five years ago, since which time it has not been disturbed. Of course no one may know how old these fish were when taken from the river, but they had evidently attained their full growth. Owing to the total darkness and seclusion in which they live, they look faded and old, but they have not lost the use of their eyes, and bid fair to outlive any of the two-legged Reese River Pioneers by a few hundred years or more.</p><p>CONCLAVICAL.</p><p>All who went from Austin to the grand Conclave at San Francisco report having a glorious good time in that Coty of Sin by the Golden Gate, and express no desire to come back yet. We read the elaborately glowing telegraphic accounts of the magnificent racket, and feel sympathizingly happy and excited. When our three Knights from Austin—Mc Kenney, Williamson and Nicholls—return, a grand reception awaits them. Everybody will be en masse; the Lander Brass Band will play ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" and other national airs and those Knights have got to march up Main street from the cars, doing the Conclave procession same as they did it at the Bay. Williamson must lead off as Commander of the Commandery, and the other two may follow in regular platoons and divisions. Austin’s subclavian artery throbs for the Conclave, and must have some of it.</p><p>GAMBRINUS ON A BUST.</p><p>Our local brewer of beer, whose name is Gus. Bauer, sometimes astonishes even himself in some things. On the 11th of June last he got a keg of double-extra good beer into his delivery wagon among the rest, and was passing along one of the upper streets, when suddenly a trouble occurred. The safety valve of that particular keg blew out, and created a serious commotion. All the other kegs went immediately overboard, and left room for that one keg to send a ferocious stream up about forty feet. The side wind of it blew Gus. off his seat, and a paralyzing stream went upward, baptizing the whole neighborhood. It subsided directly, and as soon as possible Gus. pulled that keg out of his wagon. There was only one gallon out of the twenty left in it, and that he gave to an old lady who lived close by, and who with the other astonished neighbors had witnessed the calamity. The beer looked flat and innocent enough then, and she put it into five bottles. That same night four of them blew out their corks, upsetting a shelf full of crockery above them, and sounding like the Fourth of July. She got a bit of baling rope over the cork of the fifth bottle, made a clove hitch around the neck, two turns under the bottom, and then hauled taut and belayed the end to one of the corner timbers of the cellar. Then she barricaded it safely with stove-wood and dry goods boxes, and sent for Gus. to come and take it away. But no; he delights in keeping her terrorized, and she wants to sell out and leave.</p><p>BEEF.</p><p>Perhaps you Comstockers may be in the full enjoyment of choice, tender sirloin and porterhouse steaks, and perhaps you may not, but here in Eastern Nevada is where the fullest enjoyment of those coveted luxuries are best to be had at the present time. The feed everywhere is excellent, and the quality of the beef and mutton is consequently “away up” in quality, yet not unusually so in price. The people of Austin are getting fat on good meat. Why shouldn’t they? Here’s where it grows. Yet everybody may not have the requisite coin to buy with. Our butchers, however, are liberally benevolent, and allow nobody to starve. Sometimes I think the butcher is the truest and purest charity man in any community, generally speaking. He is always giving away something substantial and nourishing in the way of meat scraps, soup bones, liver or something of the sort, that poor, impecunious humanity stands in need of.

TE27,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Tuesday……….September 4, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Cloudburst Hopes and Prospects—Waterspouts Analysis—The ""Washoe Seeress"" Slandered—Detrimental Deafness—Red-hot Fallacies—Piute Reservations, Theology and Providence—A Chinese Fighting Proposition—A Man licked by a Dog—Some Select Society Siftings.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., August 31, 1883.</p><p>Yesterday sullen thunder growled ominously along the Toiyabe range, and great kidney-shaped clouds wrestled with each other till they were black in the face, trying to produce a big rain, but their constipated condition would only allow of a few respectable showers, enough to lay the dust in the streets pretty well. Down in the valley, however, the rain poured heavily, as is required in order to keep famous Reese river up to its normal standard among running streams. The old pioneer took a fresh chaw of tobacco, and shook his head reminiscently as the big rain drops fell, and Tony Gandolfo smiled hilariously over the prospect of a regular '78 cloudburst and flood. All up and down Main street everybody got their little floodgates ready to place in the doorways, and all seemed a little disappointed when the threatening storm rolled by with no adequate result. A genuine cloudburst and flood, like that of August, '78, would create a sensation here now equal to a first-class circus. Mr. Dadd sagely remarks that it's getting a little late for the August cloudburst, yet that all hope need not be abandoned for the next two or three weeks. There is considerable difference between a cloudburst and a waterspout, although they are frequently spoken of as one and the same thing. The first is merely the meeting collision of two overloaded thunder storm clouds and a consequent sudden letting go of their watery contents down upon the earth beneath. This is naturally liable to occur about the heads of mountain canyons or ravines. A waterspout is simply a whirlwind of great or lesser magnitude which goes sweeping along over sea or land, licking and drawing hungrily upward anything it meets on the surface. At sea they thus form a fiercely seething column of water, dangerous to encounter, and on land, as they sweep across the plains, whirling sand and dirt skyward, if they encounter a river, pond or lake they pause in their reckless career to take a good, congenial drink for distribution elsewhere. The Mexicans call them ""culebras de agua,"" or water snakes, from their wavy, snaky motion as they sweep their tails along the surface. The greater weight of water met with in passing along is what causes them to go slower than when sweeping across sandy plains or valleys. Now if their course could only be managed or controlled by artificial means their immense power might be turned into practical use. For instance,  if one good, healthy waterspout could be induced to drop its suction down the main Yellow Jacket shaft, all the water in the flooded Gold Hill mines would be drawn up into the clouds in five minutes, and those submerged lower levels left as dry as a sucked orange.</p><p>THE WASHOE SEERESS</p><p>The Reno Gazette does Mrs. Sandy Bowers a rank injustice in stating that she deserted the famous Bowers Mansion a month or two after her husband died, and ""moved into a little cabin hard by, where she made her living telling fortunes."" Hundreds of people can tell the Gazette that the old lady did nothing of the ort. She occupied the Mansion itself for years afterward as landlady, receiving paying visitors, renting it out to picnic parties and making it a source of private revenue to a considerable extent. And many a thirsty picnicker remembers the cups of tea and coffee they succeeded in procuring from her, as a special favor, at two bits each; water free, but predominant. If Sandy Bowers had left his financial affairs better regulated, the old lady would be in the same line of business yet. It is true that she has, since evacuating the Mansion, established quite a lively reputation as a Spiritualistic fortune teller, seeress and all that sort of thing, and is still at the same, but she picks up plenty of pocket money at it, and anything but a ""precarious living."" Some of her predictions have been literally, squarely (and unavoidably) verified, but numerous others have not, by a long chalk, and never can be, but then she is very hard of hearing, not being able to distinguish the jingle of a quarter from the ringing of a church bell for the last thirty years.</p><p>HEALTH PROPOSITIONS.</p><p>The thermometer here in Austin has stood at about ninety degrees for the last three months, and quite often nearer 100, yet everybody has seemed healthier for it, and no doubt the heat could have been gradually increased 100 degrees more without material discomfort, and only to be recognized and appreciated as a preparatory seasoning for the hereafter. There is no doubt of the efficacy of heat as a purifier. We never hear of diseases in Tophet. But Pasteur, the famous French physiological savant, carries the idea too far for this world. He sets forth that all water for drinking or toilet purposes must be boiled, in order to kill the disease germs with which it is saturated. Even the cooking utensils, eating apparatus, etc., he insists should be roasted in an oven before using. Would such a style of life be worth living? Better defer it for the hereafter. Hot whiskies, etc., are correct enough in cold weather, the disease germs in the water being properly disposed of, but the idea that a man must drink boiling water, eat red-hot food and breathe air from a blast furnace in order to eternally avoid disease germs is simply and uncomfortably ridiculous. It is infernal nonsense.</p><p>PIUTE RELIGION.</p><p>Speaking about the hereafter, ""Stillwater Thompson,"" one of our Austin Piute savants, tells me that the Piutes do not believe in the ""happy hunting grounds"" proposition at all. They have no faith in any such felicitous reservation being set apart for them in the next world. They have seen too much of this reservation business in this world already to have any sort of affectionate confidence in it as an after-death resort. The sum and practical substance of the Piute religion consists in standing off the devil. When sickness comes they know the devil is among them, and they put all their medicine men, good, bad and indifferent, upon his track. If they can succeed in howling him off, or neutralizing his infernal influences, by their ""howly"" rites and efforts, these aboriginal medicos feel creditably triumphant. They say the Shoshone have no God, and must all eventually be absorbed and wiped out by the devil, who has already secured a vast majority of them, so that very few are not to be seen among us. Thompson says the good God of the Piutes is named Pah-ka. I thought, perhaps, he mistakenly referred to Hub Parker, of Carson, but he earnestly protested that, although Carson was ""pooty good,"" there was no God at all there, and never would be.</p><p>CELESTIAL CELEBRATION.</p><p>Sunday evening the Austin Chinese residents wound up a three-days' celebration of the closing of the Triennial Conclave at San Francisco, and the whipping of the French by the Chinese troops in their raid on the Flowery Kingdom. Sam Kee, the well-known washman, says the French have no show whatever; that the Chinese outnumber them a thousand to one, and will simply pile on and overrun them like the fatal swarming lice in Egypt. Even as a last resort, a million or two can go and commit suicide in the French camp and just stink the confounded frog-eaters out of the country. The French have a very bad job on their hands, filthy and discouraging. It is worse than fighting skunks.</p><p>CRUMBS.</p><p>Spykens says the crumb-pickers, here in Austin, remind him of thousands of people who get a good living picking up the crumbs which fall from the rich man's table. Lazarus is the first instance of the kind on record. He is also recorded as the first man licked by a dog. He had his reasons for this, however, for although he doubtless had ""sand enough in his craw,"" he had too many sores on his back, therefore being licked by dogs was simply an economical sanitary proposition for him, although perhaps a little rough on the dogs. Spykens was not a success as a dump-picker, and is now busily engaged in trying to invent a new motive power to wind up his Waterbury watch.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Captain Charley and wife, and their daughter Hattie, are gathering pine-nuts down near Stillwater.

TE28,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday..........September 9, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Humboldt Duck Harvest—Specimen Sports—Good Shooting and Good Boating—Political Duck Shooting—Senatorial Propositions—""Last Spike"" Humbuggery—Sweetly Blissful Dreams—Pine-Nut Aristocracy—Select Society Samplings.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., September 7, 1883.</p><p>The game law restrictions being removed on the first of this month, the chief sport of this section at the present is duck shooting. All along the Humboldt, hunters live in clover, and the wild ducks and geese are being slaughtered by millions. Of course, the Piutes join in the raid, and have their full share of the fun and feast. They have the advantage of the whites in the matter, financially considered, as it costs them nothing for transportation over the railroads, but they are not any more successful, and certainly do not have any more fun than their white fellow-citizens. It is only ninety-three miles from Austin to Battle Mountain and the nearest battle-grounds or duck-shooting placers on the Humboldt, and it only costs $9 to go and $9 to return, with no extra charge for game transportation on the return trip, consequently the profits of a hunting raid can be easily imagined. Hunters from other localities may not be as expert and successful as ours, but anyhow, when Starratt, Wright, Curtis and others of our standard Austin shotgun sports make a raid down to the Humboldt, the duck just come and fall dead around them, and accompany them home by the car-load, to the great delight of their interested friends. The other day Wright and Curtis went down to Battle Mountain, where they were joined by Dunn and other congenial sports, and went up the river some eight miles to sundry little lakes among the tules. There they merely waded out into the thickets bunches or groves of tall tules and blazed away at the numerous flocks of ducks incessantly passing over; keeping their dogs busy retrieving the fowls and piling them up. They took care to make their game fall as much as possible in open water, for the convenience of the dogs, and they certainly appeared to exercise considerable judgment and discretion, for all the ducks they brought home were young, fat, juicy and nice. The hunting syndicate aforesaid own a patent canvas boat, which is about the size of a canvas-back duck, when it is shut up, but when opened and spread out it is sixteen feet long, and will carry all hands, with their baggage, bedding grub and ammunition. Moreover, it cannot be upset easily and when it hits a snag or a rock, it merely doubles up a little and bounces back. A skillful dodge with that sort of boat is to blaze away at a big flock of ducks in the air, and then, by a few vigorous strokes of the paddle, catch all of the fowls in the boat as they come rattling down.</p><p>POLITICAL</p><p>Talking about ducks, the Senatorial game to be played next year in this State seems to be made quite an object of interest by sundry political journalists, and perhaps unduly and prematurely so in some respects. It must be borne in mind, however, that this important proposition can hardly be too maturely and actively considered for the best interests of our young, yet much-abused and humbugged State. Most anybody will do for Governor, and even comparatively poor men, financially, have always filled the various State offices, creditably and well, but Nevada requires only first-class statesmen, of real ability and vigilant energy, to represent and attend to her vital interests in the halls of Congress. Money has notoriously ruled the Senatorial choice to a very appreciable extent thus far, and no doubt is very liable to do so some more. Everybody recognizes the fact that millionaire rule is scandalously discreditable, yet that scandalous fact still obtains, and successfully remains in the political manipulation of the State. It is high time for radical improvement, and a new deal in that respect. A man of real ability as a statesman and true managing energy, in working for the vital interests and general prosperity of the State, is none the worse for being a millionaire, and if millionaire Senators are to be the established rule, let's be a little more honest and critically just to ourselves than we have been heretofore. But wherefore is the millionaire a prerequisite proposition? It certainly is not if the Senator is selected from Eastern Nevada. Thus far our United States Senatorial representatives have exclusively been chosen from the western part of the State, therefore whatever of discredit has resulted in the representation must attach to that circumstance. We have men of honest ability and political rectitude in this section, whose brains are not all in their purses (no egotistic reference to myself intended), and it might be well to look in this direction in the coming new deal, bearing in mind that most of our best, most popular and efficient State officers have been selected from Eastern Nevada. Anyhow, if the Republican party would win the coming Senatorial race they must put their politically strongest and best horse on the track, whether from Eureka, Gold Hill or Candelaria.</p><p>LAST SPIKES.</p><p>The great fuss being made over the driving of the ""last spike"" on the Northern Pacific Railroad is merely on a par with the same humbug ceremony at other points heretofore, and doubtless to be followed up hereafter. Yet why crow any more over the last than over the first spike? In all other public works, except railroads and bridges, the commencement and not the completion is what is celebrated. The laying of the corner-stone is considered of more importance than the laying of the last brick. Moreover, those so-called ""last spikes"" are invariably a fraud. They are of silver or gold, and are never left driven. A hole is carefully bored, into which the precious spike is gently tapped with a silver hammer or fancy little sledge, by somebody who never knew a railroad spike from a carpet tack, amid the popping of champagne and other hifalutin remarks, and when the fuss is over, and the officials leave the spot they judiciously take that same last spike along with them. It would not pay to leave it in the hole. The real ""last spike"" is of iron, driven by a sweat-scented workman, and it stays there. The ""last spike"" of the Central and Union Pacific Railroad was made of Comstock bullion, by Ruhling & Co., assayers, of your city. It was purposely made some two or three inches too long, and the surplus was chopped up into little bits and given away among personal friends as cabinet souvenirs; the spike itself is probably preserved as a relic in the Central Pacific Railroad office at San Francisco. Had it been risked to the honest of the Ogdenites it would have been extracted and shoved up for whisky for the crowd in less than half an hour after the ""last spike"" driving ceremony was over.</p><p>BLISSFUL DREAMS</p><p>Our mutual friend Spykens still cherishes his two-inch bonanza of $20,000 ore, although it does not pan out quite so big and rich as further sunk upon. He is the most hopeful man in the world, however, and his mind's eye reaches away down into the dim bowels of the earth and sees it widen and roll out tons upon tons of rich ore and resultant bullion bars. He sees the lovely ruby silver in long red streaks and pockets away down there between the pinching, hard-hearted granite walls, and he is building many castles in the air from his prospective bullion bricks. He even looks ahead to the time when he shall marry a schoolmarm and have all his children born with a good education. Ah, well, so it goes.</p><p>The choicest, sweetest dream in life</p><p>Are always dreamed awake.</p><p>NUTTING.</p><p>The pine-nut season is now in full feather, and the dusky Piute, lousy Shoshone and their ""se-quaws"" and other relatives have largely hied them away to the shady, green groves, there to gather the esculently excellent and long-admired pine-nut. This small, but numerous, nut has always constituted a staple article of food with the aboriginal inhabitants of Nevada. The effect is, at this season of the year, that the Indians are particularly independent, and don't care whether the white man's domestic stove-wood is left properly sawed and split, or his family washing done in time or not. The lordly Piute Chieftan, with eleven sacks of pine-nuts piled up in his campoodie, feels himself the financial equal of John Mackay, and from now until the cold Winter weather and solid snow and ice sets in, there is no implicit reliance to be placed upon Piute contracts for work or domestic service. Anyhow, they won't allow you to sass them for the next two or three months. But from about the middle of December, and all the long, cold Winter, while chances near the stove, and odds and ends of white folks' grub, served up hot, are coveted by them, your Indian friends, acquaintances and distant relatives are always and really too willing to cultivate your most intimate acquaintance.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Chung Wah, the one-eyed Chinaman down near the brewery, has sold out his hog ranch and will leave on the next steamer for China.

September 14, 1883</p><p>The new postage stamp law goes into effect on the 1st of next month, substituting two cent stamps, letter postage, for the regular three centers, so long in vogue. This practically disfranchises and nullifies the three cent stamps after that date, as by some strange oversight, when the new stamp law was passed, no provision was made for officially redeeming the retiring three cent stamps. There will, consequently, be some millions of dollars worth of these unfortunate stamps rendered worthless in Austin—and elsewhere throughout the United States—on that date. The effect is that everybody is working hard writing letters and getting well ahead on correspondence, in order to use up their remaining stamps so as not to have any left on hand when the fatal day arrives. Even the bar-keepers now hesitate to receive them for drinks, although they know, of course, that the next Congress will promptly correct the trouble and provide equitable redemption for the retired stamps.</p><p>LEGISLATIVE.</p><p>The premature agitation of the Senatorial question also induces legislative speculations and prognostications. It is generally admitted that the last Legislature did not amount to much, and was to be commended for its harmlessness more than anything else, yet it being a sort of off-year in politics, so to speak, and an unimportant session, but little was expected from it. But not so with the next Legislature. It has to elect a United States Senator, to succeed Hon. J. P. Jones, which is a very responsible circumstance of itself. Primarily and fundamentally both leading political parties will make civil or official service reform and State administration economy the leading and most important feature in the contest. We have too many State officials and too many high salaries for the people to support and pay in the present condition of the State finances and resources. And so, too, with county offices and county expenses. Anything that can be done to reduce the burden of the galled and wearied taxpayers must be done, and, as before remarked, both political parties will bear this in mind, and make political capital for themselves accordingly. That's what the people think in this section, and Eastern Nevada proposes taking a lively and effective interest in the coming political campaign.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>In a district like this, noted for its numerous small but rich ore veins, new and valuable strikes are naturally and frequently made known to the public, but many a nice little pocket is struck in the regular working of the mines, which are quietly worked and much acceptable coin realized therefrom without general public knowledge. Men working on ""days pay"" have their regular bonanza once a month, when pay day comes, but there are scores of enterprising ""tributers"" who cannot be hired to work for anybody but themselves. Many of these work steadily along, month after month, without realizing a cent, and dependent upon the Manhattan Company for assistance—indeed many have thus worked hopefully for years. But sooner or later they are liable to meet with the long-looked for ""good time coming."" This is best demonstrated, and the lucky ones indicated, by their apparent increase in financial prosperity, trips to California, the East, or to the old country. Old abandoned workings of past years are occasionally revived into practical activity under new auspices and in most instances with excellent success. Thus it was with the abandoned workings of the Plymouth shaft two or three years ago. Half a dozen well known Comstock miners took it in hand and now have lot of money. Recently a party of six, mostly former Comstock miners took a lease of the Great Eastern, which was abandoned three years ago on account of too much water, at the depth of 300 feet. They have got the water all out, and are working night and day, hoisting by means of a whim horse power arrangement. They have already met with some nice little ""kidneys"" of rich ore, and feel prosperous, with a very hopeful future before them. May they strike it big. The mines generally are yielding finely and looking well, there being very much more ore in sight than there was last year at this time, and everything in better shape for working. The mill is certainly having an extraordinarily long run, which bids fair to hold out for several months longer yet.</p><p>SANITARY.</p><p>After a three months' steady, unvarying run of ninety degrees in the shade, the weather is shading off to something cooler. Austin never was healthier than during the present season. The town is very judiciously located on a series of gentle mountain slopes, the water supply is excellent, and so also is the whisky. In most parts of the town people run their slops wherever it comes handiest, regardless of all sewer arrangements. This system or lack of system might prove detrimental to the public health, were it not for a peculiar scavenger bug that generously comes to the rescue. This enterprising bug is about the size of a dried prune, has pitchfork horns, stiff, wiry legs, petrified charcoal back, no tail and an atrocious breath. He rushes about slowly, absorbing all the domestic and foreign stinks and sewage impurities, carefully digesting and retaining the same within his internal economy, and thus rendering Austin all the more healthy. He crawls about houses, sociably and searchingly, and is quiet and inoffensive unless you disturb or injure him, when you will regret it forthwith, for he just can deliberately outstink anything else in the wide world. The odor of the skunk is simply bouquet fragrance in comparison. The thrifty housewife, as well as the old pioneer, greatly admire and respect this popular bug and appreciate his sanitary qualities, as a high-flavored disinfectant.</p><p>DEPARTED HOPES.</p><p>Our friend Spykens has received a note from Professor Snider, at Las Angeles, accompanied with a package of dried orange peel, and a bottle of hair restorative from Mrs. S. The Professor says his health has not improved since marrying and leaving Austin, but Mrs. Snider, formerly the Widow McWinzle, never was healthier. The cruel, revengeful sarcasm of the widow is appreciated in view of the circumstance of Spykens having become bald-headed since being in Eastern Nevada. One day, out at Tuscarora, he was being shaved, and unguardedly allowed the barber to shampoo him. What sort of infernal mill chemicals that barber used in the process he does not know, but, anyhow, the next day most of his back hair fell off in spots, and directly he had to get him a wig to keep his head worm. In view of his having to dodge the widow's ardent matrimonial attempts upon him so lively when here, he looks upon it as live-coal cruelty on her part, sending him this bottle of hair restorative. She evidently cherishes and nourishes her revenges.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>When the neighbors come in to borrow Dr. Green's saw-buck now, he astonishes by his affable cordiality. ""Go take it,"" blandly remarks he, with a friendly wave of his hand. ""You’ll fid it out in the back yard."" And they do find it, and they find it's a new one, made of timbers eight inches square, set seven feet into the solid ground, and they don't get away with it, but go home over the back fence.</p><p>I received a letter yesterday from Colonel U. E. Allen, formerly of your city, and a member of the Legislature. He is now high chief purveyor of the Scoville House, the chief hotel of Waterbury, Connecticut, prosperous and happy, and sends his ""everlasting blessing"" to all his numerous friends in Nevada, promising to deal with them kindly should they happen to come his way. He says State Controller Hallock is in that section.</p><p>The young ladies of Austin shyly accuse their festive bachelor friend, Faddleton, of wearing a wig, when he only dyes his hair. He should rub down nearer to the roots. Perhaps he thinks he humbugs everybody but himself. But he don't. Quit it. In the lexicon of youth, verging into gray-haired maturity, never say dye.</p><p>Tom Gundry has got him a new gun. It is double-barreled, came all the way from Birmingham, England, and cost ""thirty pound"" there. It is the finest gun in the State, but out of place. He couldn't hit the Comstock ledge with it at forty yards.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE29.jpg,territorial
TE30,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday..........September 23, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Passed Trouble—Reese River Flour and Wheat—Barley—A Chapter on Potatoes—Incipient Talent Developing—Piute Tribal Relations and Relatives—Where George Washington Should Have Been Born and Brought Up—Society Notes and Comments.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., September 21, 1883.</p><p>The regular annual cloudburst having failed to put in its appearance, as usual, and the period of feverish expectancy having passed completely without even a slight demonstration in that respect, our citizens are cooling down with the cooler weather to their regular mutton and potatoes. The old stiffs confess their disappointment at the non-repetition of the disaster of August, '78, but now prognosticatingly and hopefully look forward to next year for proper vindication.</p><p>REESE RIVER FLOUR.</p><p>The new flouring mill, down at Ledlie, some half dozen miles from here, on the banks of the raging Reese, proves to be the complete success that it was anticipated to be, and has turned out numerous sacks of most excellent flour, which finds very ready sale in Austin, as it should. Hereafter, wheat will doubtless be made the principal grain crop, in order to keep that mill in profitable work. The wheat produced in this section is generally plump, heavy and good, with a fair average yield per acre, and very little more cost in raising than in many sections of our more favored sister State, California. Many a poor farmer in the Golden State is happy if he is lucky enough to get half as much for his wheat as our farmers do. By judicious management of the wheat production and in selling the flour a trifle cheaper than other brands can be transported from California and elsewhere over the railroads, our grain-producing farmers should control their own market, and Reese River flour, from its superior excellence alone, find ready sale in outside localities.</p><p>POTATOES.</p><p>Barley is a hardier, and, therefore, more common crop, but the market for it being limited, remunerative prices, or even sale for it, cannot always be obtained. Potatoes, however, are always in order and all right so far as a market is concerned. That honest old vegetable is always welcome to the population of Austin. Everybody buys potatoes, regardless of price, even the very earliest and most unwholesomely unripe being eagerly snapped up at a bit a pound. But now the ranchers are bringing them in from all sides, and they are not only cheap—two cents by the sack—but of the highest order of merit, large, slick and mealy. The potato crop rarely or never failing in suitable localities, and the yield being plentiful, the triumphant spud rancher is the bonanza man from the rural suburbs. It is not necessary to be an Irishman to properly appreciate a good potato, and especially those raised in this section. That royal old chief of the vegetable kingdom comes forth from the pot in steamy, fragrant glory, his clean, brown vest gently parting and rolling back its collar, as he proudly throws out his white, fleecy breast to your enraptures gaze. How one's mouth waters as the anticipations of a little salt and good sweet butter come in connection therewith, and how eagerly and beneficially that welcome combination is sought and judiciously put into practical effect. Argus-eyed, smooth-faced and mealy-mouthed though he be, none can ever accuse the potato of being hypocritical. He has frequently been used as pelting demonstration of popular reproof to unworthy actors or lecturers on the stage, but has never run for office or from an officer. There's nutriment in him; he shows his noble qualities in his honest face, and is, therefore, deservedly popular and appreciatively admired. (How's that for a spud eulogy?)</p><p>SPECIMEN PRODUCTS.</p><p>Eastern Nevada perhaps produces no smarter or worse specimen boys and girls than the older and reputably more sinful western portion of the State, and perhaps Austin is no criterion in that respect; but it was here that Emma Nevada spent her youthful culminating days, with her parents, and from Austin she went forth to unprecedented success in the European world of operatic harmony. And we have boys of tender years and a great capacity who may yet astonish the world as high-toned, first-class stage robber, burglars or petty larceny thieves. They are sent to school, get there sometimes, smoke cigarettes, swear like young troopers, steal, lie and possess other qualifications. One not very bright looking little chap, with a sharp nose, thin face and pensive eye, will operate as a petty larceny thief, work his way up to high-toned burglary, and graduate in the State Prison. Another more stalwart youth will in due time step out on the road as a resolute and successful stage robber. Not many seem cut out for murderers, yet may have undeveloped and unexpected talents in that line and make their mark, to the surprise of all who know them best. Parents, here or in other localities, should be a little more vigilant, and see that their boys go to school, or are properly kept disciplined or judiciously employed.</p><p>INDIAN RELATIONS.</p><p>The Piutes about Austin are all healthy, prosperous, and thrive and increase, and have more children and tribal relations than anybody. There are many good looking women and young girls among them, and the men are generally tall, well-built fellows. They are around among the whites a great deal, yet do not seem to adopt many of the vices of the pale-face very readily. Some of them swear and drink whisky pretty well, and in due time may become as bad as the whites. How to properly care for, and judiciously rule and manage these wards of the nation, and original occupants of the country, has always been a perplexing domestic and judicial problem. They are allowed to run their own affairs, manage themselves, and preserve their tribal relations to a very considerable extent, even in the matter of crime committed among themselves. They are literally native Americans, naturally citizens, yet were they legally held to be citizens, under the law they should be allowed full liberty in the ""pursuit of happiness,"" even to getting drunk, in which case it could be no legal crime to sell them whisky. Self-interest and self-defense, however, suggests that no Indians should be allowed unrestricted rights and privileges, any more than should thousands of irresponsible, low-trash whites. Lo is low enough generally, without making him any lower. Over in California his ""tribal relations"" have become mixed with the whites to such an extent that the aboriginal race has become nearly run out. All judicial problems in that respect are rapidly solving themselves.</p><p>THE HOME OF TRUTH.</p><p>One grand feature of Austin is prevalent and universal truthfulness. Old residents and pioneers do not know how to lie, and even tough immigrants from the Comstock and elsewhere gradually lose all their natural abilities in that line, through a sympathetic leaching process, as it were, and become purified to the regular prevailing standard. Mr. Dadd, who came here with old Reese, and was the first to subside into this local stratum of chronic truthfulness, has not been able to tell a lie for twenty years. An enthusiastic missionary, who several years ago desired to write a book on this subject, wanted to get Mr. Dadd's portrait for a front page illustration, but his native modesty would not allow him to be thus made a second George Washington. A good square liar might prove a refreshing variety in Austin, and perhaps do well here, if he could only hold out.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>A committee of gentlemen from Reno have just arrived for the purpose of securing a few million of those fragrant black sanitary bugs, mentioned in my last letter.

And as usual they predict a ""hard Winter."" They tell how the chipmunks are building their nests among the higher rocks, and in the dryest, warmest locations, and are also laying in an unusually heavy supply of pine-nuts. The Piutes also happen to be doing the same thing in the matter of nuts, for the reason that the harvest of that staple commodity has been unusually good this season. Then they go on to mention the significant superabundance of flies, which circumstance is also correct, for during the last three or four months of unremittingly hot weather the flies have improved their time, multiplying crop after crop, until the air and everything else was thick with them. But this Wintry snap has laid them out cold, although a possible spell of warm weather may temporarily thaw them out of their retirement. Anyhow the pine-nut crop has been splendid this season, and the Piutes are returning from their nut orchards out in the high mountain ranges loaded with numerous sacks and baskets of them, and they are both happy and independent. They will feel like bonanza folks until their nuts are gone and they have come down to the refuse grub and slop barrels of the white folks.</p><p>A CRUEL AGGRAVATION.</p><p>The other day Spykens received a strange newspaper, one he had never heard of before, and he nearly worried himself into a fit, reading it carefully through, and looking it over and over to find out why anybody had sent it to him. He saw no item or paragraph which referred to him, or was of special interest to him, so he finally arose in wrath and cremated it in the stove. It was not the first of his experience in that line, however. The news editorial fraternity can appreciate this exasperating annoyance to the most complete extent. Any person who will thus send unmarked a strange paper to a newspaper office is a depraved, heartless brute. The ever faithful and vigilant news editor grabs his trusty shears and runs his weary eyes eagerly through each column and all over every page after some marked article or paragraph of special interest, and waxes profane as he finds it not. Then he curses the blundering ass who sent it, and impatiently chucks it into the waste basket. Speaking about</p><p>ANNOYANCES,</p><p>Wright, of the Postoffice Bazaar, has recently had a peculiar experience in that line. He had four real nice awning posts, made of iron piping the size of a horse's leg in front of his establishment. They were good to lean against or hitch animals to, and were quite useful in a variety of ways, although not particularly needed, as the awning was well braced and self-supporting. But every passing schoolboy, street gamin or juvenile Piute felt it incumbent upon him to take a climb at those posts, shinning up and sliding down them, performing numerous gymnastic varieties until they had them polished smooth. After much scolding, and adopting various devices, Wright finally put a stop to the annoyance by smearing the tops of the posts with a compound of coal tar and patent axle-grease—above where people would be liable to soil their clothes in leaning or rubbing against them. The first experimental boy came down with his hands beautifully bedaubed, but he passed no remarks. He had lots of fun watching how other boys ""caught on to the racket,"" and Wright felicitated himself upon his ingenious success. But that very night he caught half a dozen boys industriously finishing up his job by tarring the lower part of those posts. Next day he had them taken down and put in use as sewer pipes at his residence, consequently there are now no posts in front of the Austin Postoffice, and the trouble has totally ceased.</p><p>HOWLING ANNOYANCES.</p><p>The howling Piute doctor, heretofore mentioned in these letters, still continues faithful to his trust, and from the little Indian village on the hillside south of town his loud, doleful howlings can be heard night and day, curing the sick, bewailing the dead, and trying to stand off the devil generally. He howls himself to sleep, and wakes up with a fresh howl. Some of our Celtic fellow-citizens have dubbed him ""Howly Moses."" There are several dogs about town, however, which can match the doctor pretty well in the matter of howling. The ringing of a church bell brings out their talent in that line to perfection. They immediately cross themselves, as it were, sit down, and with eyes closed and noses high in air, they send forth some of the most doleful howls anybody ever heard. Yet they seem to enjoy it.</p><p>POLITICAL HOWLING.</p><p>Wherefore the present disturbance in the political lodge? The aspirants have not tapped their bells or tooted their horns, yet a wild howl goes upward from the press of the State. One after another is asserted to be in the Senatorial or Congressional field, and in a politically mongrel variety of ways. Some see fit to deny the soft impeachment, while others merely pass it by as interested editorial speculations. Daggett treats his still-born nomination for United States Senator as a friendly joke, quietly gets married and goes back to far more congenial pleasures amid the yams, sugar canes and banana shades of Hawaii. He has had his experience as a Congressional nominee, and paid for it. He wanted to be Governor, subsequently, but was expressedly confident that the Central Pacific folks would not allow him the honor, and, anyhow, most infinitely and sensibly preferred the greater emoluments, financial chances and quietly effective honors of his present comfortable and influential position to any chances in that line which Nevada could offer him. Daggett learns wisdom from experience, and you could neither run nor sail fast enough to give him a Nevada nomination of any sort, neither for his own benefit nor that of the Republican party. As a straightforward Republican, he has no desire to even assist in putting up a ticket for the Democracy to beat. In the bright lexicon of partisan politics the strongest men must be placed in nomination in order that there shall be ""no such word as fail."" As we have before remarked, however, geographical considerations in that respect must not be ignored, and the political claims of Eastern Nevada cannot be set aside with impunity.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>There is never any great howl about the mines of Austin. They are simply and regularly worked right straight along, paying their way well without any assessments, and supporting a very respectable sized and conditioned community. The ore veins are small and unreliable, but there are lots of them, and they average finely in the matter of bullion yield, as shown by the regular shipments. Thoroughly systematic, vigilant and effective management is the rule and the beneficial result. The mines of the Eureka section are stated to be showing considerable improvement of late, both in the old workings and prospecting mines.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Houses are plenty in Austin, but they are all occupied. Nobody seems to care to risk building small houses, for fear he may not get rent enough, or large ones, for fear he may not be able to rent them at all.</p><p>For a man who is well fixed, or even reasonably so, Austin offers better inducements than any other town in the State—for matrimony. We have numerous eligible young ladies, and some of them have a little coin laid away in the toe of their stocking. Fuller information furnished for a liberal consideration.</p><p>Most of our Piute ladies are laying in their Winter stock of ginghams, from the proceeds of their pinenut sales.

He must be killed. Every house, little or big, is occupied to its fullest extent, even to dugouts in the hillsides, and more are being built by a few enterprising individuals who have faith, or who have to build or stay out of doors. A singular feature in Austin architecture consists in the almost total absence of any up-stairs accommodations. The usual residence is a low-roofed, very much spread out affair, with additional rooms built on as the family situation, or increase, may demand; but though the roof may cover half an acre, it never seems to occur to the builder thereof that it costs no more to roof two or three stories than one. The space between the rafters is rarely utilized by an upper floor. There is not a dozen two story houses in the place. If we were a little nearer the Comstock we might utilize a few dozen of your vacant houses by transferring them to Austin, but railroad transportation is too costly—about five cents a pound.</p><p>TELEGRAPHIC.</p><p>The recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, declaring the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, is the most important dispatch which has come over the wires since the Garfield assassination episode. The Reveille had it in full, but did not seem to appreciate it; anyhow it got off a chronic growl, speaking of it as ""a great, dry report of a Supreme Court decision,"" and expressing its preference for something about the coal miners' strike in Pennsylvania, or something of that sort. The Reveille should publish the telegrams as received, without comments. Yet fresh telegrams cost money, and the Reveille has the latest and best. The people of Austin should appreciate this fact, and liberally support their local paper. ""Money makes the mare go,"" and coin pays for telegrams. Readers of the latest and best telegrams from all parts of the world should be willing to pay for them.</p><p>THAT CADETSHIP.</p><p>It is a very appreciable fact that most of the people of Nevada are glad that General Connor's son failed to pass examination for the cadetship from this State. That he was an inch too short in stature is assigned as the reason of his failure, yet his father is an old experienced military man, and most assuredly should have been conversant with all the requirements and not subject the boy to such a detrimental failure. There has been too much favoritism in this matter shown in times past. Young men who were really not competent, either mentally or physically, have been pushed forward for the position, with the hope of their parents and personal friends that they would pass and after months of careful ""coaching"" they have been sent on to Washington, there to undergo the impartial, rigid examination exposing their bed-rock, so to speak, and sent home unhappy. For the credit of Nevada it is to be hoped that no more experimental favoritism may be used hereafter in this very important matter. We have a smart boy or two in Austin, other localities in the State can say the same, and we know there are quite a number of young men on the Comstock eligible for the position. The only straightforward, politic and correct way is to let them all have a chance in a competitive preliminary examination and thus send our smartest and best boys. If they fail then it will be our fault and not so much theirs. The failure of young Connor leaves the position open to competition, so says Congressman Cassidy, therefore let our best boy go in and win.</p><p>SENATORIAL.</p><p>The Reveille still persists in trying to victimize Daggett, and sacrificingly cremate him on the Senatorial altar. Bah! From the poop deck of the gallant ship with his fair bride on board, the festive and happy Daggett looks back over the stern, places his right thumb in side contact with his nose, and significantly twiddles his fingers Nevadawards as he gently remarks: ""No, you don't; not for Rollin. A rolling stone gathers no moss in the political field, and I'm just rollin' over the seas to my Hawaiian campoody, beneath the wild banana tree, where the voracious politicians cease from troubling and the weary candidate finds rest. Ta, ta! call me not back. As the Dutch girl said 'I's been fooled dat way before!' "" Hon M. J. Farrell, or some other equally competent gentleman from Eastern Nevada, would fill the bill for Congressman, but where is the man to succeed Jones as Senator? Sharon does not care to try it again and Mackay is no political aspirant. Most of the prominent men of the western part of the State have left for California and other eligible localities, and Jones seems left to try and be his own successor, if he desires so to do. If being a poor man is any qualification, Jones is all right in that respect. When he was in bonanza he scattered his millions loose among the people, and now he doubtless wishes some of it back for present necessities. But Jones has not signified his wish to be considered in the Senatorial field again, and perhaps would rather let somebody else have the honor. In which case who is the coming man? Not Daggett, for he has gone, and does not wish to come some more, at least not for that proposition.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>All over the State the surface workings of the discovered mines seem to be pretty well worked out, yet this can hardly be said of the mines of Austin. They are not so deep by over 2,000 feet as yours of the Comstock, mere surface scratching in comparison, yet they are at the present time looking just as well as ever, to say the least, and bid fair to hold out the same to an indefinite depth. Perhaps they may improve, and eventually the small, rich ""razor blade"" veins lead to that mythical ""mother lode"" which has always been predictively gazed at in the dreams of the old Reese River pioneers. This, however, is simply a matter for future reference. But at present we of Eastern Nevada are all interestedly and hopefully watching Comstock propositions, for it is an established principle in the Nevada mining lexicon that the fortunes or misfortunes of the Comstock very influentially affect the entire State. It is pleasant to us to learn that John Mackay is standing in, and in fact and reality back from Paris and meandering through the lower levels, in his sweaty gray woolen shirt as of old, before he was rich enough to build a national telegraph or financially help out all his old friends. It is pleasant to read that he is pleased with the present prospects developed in those lower levels and believes in rich future possibilities at still greater depths, and it is a source of encouragement that he, Fair, Sharon and others of the old mining chiefs do not abandon the old Comstock by any means, but are still expending their hundreds of thousands in the development of its future possibilities. Perhaps it is the presence of John Mackay in the State that is making the mines of Eureka and elsewhere in this section look better. Anyhow, we are all pleased to know that he is in his native sagebrush, so to speak, and comfortingly near us. The suit of Thomas Kehoe against Thomas Breen was concluded in the district Court here on Tuesday. Kehoe worked for years with Breen, and is, in fact, said to have been the discoverer of the mine, which is two or three miles northerly from here, in the edge of Reese River Valley. They made a good living from the occasional ore crushings, dividing equally; but when Breen sold out the mine a few months ago for $20,000 he neglected to recognize Kehoe as partner and entitled to half. He also refused Kehoe's offer to settle for $2,000, and the jury decides that he must come to an equal divvy of $10,000. So much for trying to hog the whole. It is said Breen will appeal.</p><p>EARTHQUAKES.</p><p>The recent severe earthquakes in California and along the Pacific Coast shake the logic out of Frank Stewart's theory, that the completion of the railroad across the continent would put a stopper on future operations of the kind by passing off the electric current eastward, over or through the iron rails. Now we have three overland railroads completed, yet the earthquakes still continue in full force and effect. But they are no great shakes, anyhow.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>A hopeful and willing young lady said the other day that she wondered why so many eligible young men as there are in Austin could get along without marrying. She felt disgusted and exasperated at the fewness of marriages and said the matrimonial condition was really a measure of economy if the young men could only be induced to view it in that light. She is correct. Most of those who starve to death, die from dissipation, poverty or neglect, or who, despairingly, commit suicide, are single men. Many a young fellow, destined to a drunkard's or a suicide's grave, has avoided both by getting married and becoming the father of eleven children.</p><p>Dick Mitchell, brother to Johnny Mitchell, formerly foreman in the Justice mine, who left here with his wife and children to visit his old home and relatives in Redruth parish, Cornwall, last May, returned with them all right a day or two ago. They had a glorious good time, saw lots of comfortable and pleasant arrangements, and were satisfied to return to Austin, where they have plenty of friends, and can get along prosperously and well.</p><p>The gentlemen Piutes all wear three linen dusters apiece now, on account of the increased coldness of the weather. The lady Piutes also wear an extra blanket.</p><p>Ducks and geese are getting quite plenty in market; that is to say, the Piute warriors are bringing them in by the sackful and peddling them out at a dollar a pair for ducks, and a dollar for a goose. Great expectations are also formed of the result of the raid of our chief Austin hunters who went down to the Humboldt a few days ago.  ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE32.jpg,territorial
TE33,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday..........November 4, 1883</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Good Telegraphic Reports—County Treasury Robberies—How to Prevent Them—The Manhattan Mill and Austin Mines—A Long Milling Run and a Prosperous Outlook—How People Go and Come, and How They Feel About It—Outside Husks—Society and Senatorial Notes.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., November 2, 1883.</p><p>The Reveille now has just as good telegraphic dispatches as any other paper on the Pacific Coast, in proportion to its size and field. They are newsy, fresh, varied, and, during the last day or two, decidedly interesting, especially to former Comstockers. To an old resident of that section, like myself, familiar with the ins and outs of everything and everybody, the latest and most important intelligence from the big bonanza croppings and shells is like turtle soup with the meat and gravy of the Eastern dispatches. Then, too, we eagerly look for the ENTERPRISE, with its supplementary details, full accounts, and latest dispatches from all parts of the world, only one day behind the local lightning.</p><p>THAT TREASURY ROBBERY.</p><p>It does seem strange, and does not look well for Storey county, with her treasury in a big brick building, right in the heart of the biggest town or city in the State, to have that treasury vault systematically robbed almost year after year. Treasurer Carrick robbed it, and said he did so because he required coin to put up as ""more mud"" in his little stock speculations, etc. He was sent to State Prison a little while, and then rejoined his wife and family and emigrated to where his grape-vine twineth and his fig tree flourisheth, in a more genial region, where stocks trouble not and the lesson he learned at the expense of Storey county will do him a heap of good. But this last robbery is a stunner. How did those bold, burglarious brigands know that the time-lock on the safe was defective? Why did they so confidently thus order Treasurer Nevin: ""You open the door of the vault and take the combination off the safe, and we will chance the time-lock?"" Well, these enterprising robbers rubbed past the Sheriff's office and jail, just across the entry, and sacked the Treasury of over $8,000, leaving poor Nevin locked up in the safe in place of the gold and silver. It took longer to get him out of that than it did to steal the money and get away with it. Perhaps, however, Nevin was mistaken in his estimate of the amount of coin in the vault. Anyhow, the moral to be pointed in this and sundry other recent cases is somewhat as follows: County Treasurers are too much exposed. They should not be compelled to work in their offices after sunset. They should never be allowed to have over six-bits in the safe at any one time. The time-locks should be perfect. The safe or vault should be abolished, for it is a costly delusion and an infernal humbug. Nevin's bondsmen are responsible only for his personal honesty and efficiency while in office, therefore the misfortune of this bold robbery necessarily has to fall upon the overburdened taxpayers of Storey County.</p><p>A PROSPEROUS RUN.</p><p>The Manhattan mill, which does all the ore grinding and bullion brick production for this mining district, commenced its present long-continued run on the 28th of October, 1882, consequently has been running over a year without having to stop from lack of ore. At one time last Summer it shut down about three weeks for absolutely necessary repairs, and at a few other times during the year requisite repairs have caused stoppages of a day or two, but its general rate of ore reduction has been about 600 tons per month on the average, the year's run yielding considerably over a million dollars. But the best part of the proposition lies in the fact that the mines themselves are looking and promising better even than they did a year ago, with more ore in sight and better facilities for extraction. These mines are very systematically managed, under the control of the Manhattan Company, and most certainly are being worked for all they are worth, due attention being always given to prospecting and exploring ahead for new deposits, while the  present ores are being worked out. Thus a vast amount of costly dead work is constantly being done, but it pays first rate in the end, and although no dividends are declared, no assessments have to be levied, which is a very comfortable circumstance. Anyhow, the Manhattan Company flourishes and prospers well, and supports a very flourishing community.</p><p>AUSTINITES ABROAD.</p><p>John Booth, proprietor of the Reveille, occasionally takes a trip out in the country, and has just returned from one to Idaho, Salt Lake, etc. He had a pretty good time, and was well treated, but found no place like home, even in the City of the Saints, consequently comes back more in love with Austin than ever. As to that matter, scores of old residents find their way back feeling the same way, as has been, and still is, the experience of numerous old Comstockers. They pack up and leave, shaking the dust off their heels, saying, ""Good bye, old played out chicken camp,"" and they go away up in Washington Territory, or some similar seaport, dreaming of the glorious things they have read of and been told about. They all go away hilariously hopeful, and many are never able to get back; yet frequently some return like Prodigal sons, tired of big trout, salmon, fat grouse, quail on toast, and all that sort of fancy husks, and are delighted to get Austin horn steaks and sausage once more. Thus, too, they come back even from ""the old country,"" remembering better prosperity and easier times here than they find abroad. People with plenty of money, however, may find London, Paris, San Francisco, or other outside localities preferable to Austin in some respects.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>The ball of the Austin National Guard night before last, was the chief fantastic toe event of the season. International Hall was crowded all night with the happiest, most festive assemblage in the world, and the consequent wealth flowing into the treasury of the company places it on a bonanza foundation. They will be able to afford more ample coat-tails for dress parade.</p><p>Mr. Dadd thinks Sharon is having a Hill of a time in his present matrimonial blackmailing episode, in fact, too much up hill for a little man. But such seems to be the penalty of affluence on the Pacific Coast; look at Baldwin, Mackay, Fair and others for example. Mr. Dadd most earnestly desires to avoid getting rich. He is poor, but proud and comfortably happy and wishes to remain so. Pride and poverty is said to have been the downfall of old Cole's dog.</p><p>Surprise parties are an especial feature in Austin society notions, and are well followed up, occurring frequently, or as often as occasion offers. They are always agreeable and nobody is ever totally surprised. Balls and dances are frequent and always well attended, and the shrewdest bean is he who gets a chance to go home with a girl that somebody else brought to the dance.</p><p>If Senator Jones cannot be induced to try again to succeed himself, perhaps Hon. C. C. Stevenson, of Gold Hill, might be the man. He has been suggested, and is not only a man of known ability and legislative experience, but also is very influential, with a good, square, politically-consistent record. He is not as good a talker as Jones, but he is always practical, and if he would work as hard and do as well for his constituents and the State as he has always done for himself, he could not fail to give perfect satisfaction. But cannot Carson or Reno put up somebody to succeed Jones? Have they no men of similar ability? There is plenty of time, however, to study over and discuss this important matter.

The stores, bank, express and Postoffices are closed, the saloons are all open and the churches well attended. Austin likes to go to church, especially when the weather is fine, as it is to-day, and he or she always feels better for it, regardless as to what the preacher may say, for [then] it is that each has a square look and intimate considerate inspection of the other from various worldly points of view. And the regular gossips meet and compare notes on the way home, and get a fresh start on the entire week's gossip, or until they meet again. The singing in all three of the churches is excellent and attractive, and the clergy do their part in the way of religious instruction. When there are any sort of outside attractions, however, such as a military or a musical turnout, a target or pigeon shooting, or a baseball game, good sleighing, etc., Austinites do not quite all go to church.</p><p>GONE BEYOND</p><p>George H. Mullen, an old pioneer of California and Nevada, died about 12 o'clock last night, and was buried this afternoon. Mullen was a native of Maine, about fifty years of age, and came to California in 1850. He followed mining, and the silver discoveries attracted him over the Sierra to Nevada, arriving in Austin in 1963, over twenty years ago. He had a wife, a son and daughter; but the wife died some twelve years ago. The children grew to maturity, and the daughter married in the Golden State, and the son is here in Austin. Mullen was always an enterprising, hard working miner, sanguine and hopeful, and though not always successful, he managed to pick up considerable money. Moreover, he knew how to save it pretty well. He had no bad habits, was ignorant of the taste of alcoholic beverages, and did not know whisky toddy from small beer. He held on to a half-dollar as vigorously as others would upon a $20 piece, denying himself the luxuries of life, and almost going without sufficient clothes to wear. He used to have money buried, and, so far as he could be, was his  own banker, always, evidently, fondly dreaming of some day in the sunny future when he could call himself a rich man, and branch out and enjoy himself as such. A year or so ago he got into difficulty with the Manhattan Mining Company about some ore which was in his possession, and a suit by him against that company, for several thousand dollars in the United States Circuit Court, at Carson, is the present outcome of the matter. How it will terminate, under the present circumstances, remains to be seen, of course. He went to Reno a few days ago to consult his lawyer, and contracted a severe cold, which resulted rapidly in pneumonia and death. His very abstemious life had not rendered his constitution proof against that only sickness of his life, and his last hours were a painful, desperate struggle for breath. He was reported to have a large amount of money buried somewhere, and yesterday morning his physician told him to arrange his worldly affairs, for he was very likely to die in a few hours; that if he had any information to divulge to some trusted friend as to his money and property he had better do so forthwith. But Mullen was resolute, and clung fast to the secret of his bosom, saying he would do that by and by, or to-morrow would be time enough. Before noon, however, his brain was deranged, and so remained till he died, he not being even able to recognize his best friends.</p><p>BURIED TREASURE.</p><p>And now the most exciting of popular talk and consideration is: Where is Mullen's money buried? All remember that when he was arrested, over a year ago, at the time of his difficulty with the Manhattan Company, he had money buried beneath the floor of his cabin, which was brought to light with the assistance of the Sheriff, and the popular idea is that he has pots and cans full of golden twenties, and bars of silver buried in some very shrewdly-selected locality. Some who pretend to know stoutly assert that there must be over $40,000 of it. Could the locality of this very desirable treasure trove be known how eagerly half of Austin would be digging for it. How provoking that Mullen should thus carry his great secret to the grave with him. His little cabin is carefully watched, however, under the care of his relatives and interested friends, and proper explorations well be promptly made. The chances are, however, that his money is not buried there this time. He was a man who closely guarded his own financial secrets, and had no personal confidant in that respect, consequently everybody is in a perplexing state of doubt. He had some money banked in San Francisco, also some money coming to him from the firm to whom he has been shipping ores in that city, but perhaps his savings and money account has been overrated. Perhaps he left no money buried at all. But hundreds who knew him well stoutly assert their belief that he did, and whether he did or did not, both open and secret search will be made in years to come for Mullen's buried treasure. It is the old Captain Kidd and Cocos Islands stories on a small scale at present, but as the years advance it will grow larger and expand into hundreds of thousands. But the great moral in all this consists in the fact that Mullen was not ready to die. Never having been sick before, he saw no reason for giving up life, and his precious, carefully kept secrets, therefore clung eagerly to all till the last, refusing to even consider the death proposition. What a fine subject for a sermon.</p><p>MONGOLIAN FUNERAL EPISODE.</p><p>Last Sunday we had a way up Chinese funeral by way of variety. Ah Cheow, a man of prominence in the celestial circles of Austin, was the subject. He had been a resident here for several years, principally following the business of restaurant cook, etc., and was reputed to have accumulated a few thousands in ready coin. Anyhow the Chinese had quite a time over his remains. They put the body in a fine American casket and kept it three days till Sunday. It was a cloudy day, inclined to be stormy, and snow already covered the ground. In an open space between the houses in the Chinese quarter they had four tables. On one was the coffin; next came one with a cooked chicken, little dishes of rice, liquids of some kind in open dishes, and a lot of candles and rush lights burning. The third table was spread with apples and other fruits and sweetmeats, and the fourth was occupied by a large roasted hog, cooked whole and spread out with his back upward. Some queer looking sausage garnished the outfit, and flags and banners were interspersed. There were also two bands of music present—one a regular brass band from down town, which was hired for $50 to lead off the funeral in good Melican style, and the other was the Chinese band of gong, drum, cymbals, etc. These bands alternated and strongly contrasted in the playing, and drew large crowds of men, women and children, Indians, etc., from all quarters. Soon the plumed hearse and carriages arrived, and about 2 o'clock P.M. the funeral procession started, passing through the principal streets. A Chinaman on horseback, with a red and white sash, acted as chief marshal, and a sort of lieutenant, also mounted and sashed, brought up the rear. The brass band on foot, at the head of the procession, played lively airs, and all marched at rather a quick step. The hearse, with pall-bearers, followed the band, and then came a hack and an omnibus containing Chinese women and the Celestial band, which kept up a steady din in passing through the streets, regardless of time, tune or anything else but noise. One little Chinaman walked behind the hearse, bearing three slim punk candles, to be burned on the grave, and about fifty Chinamen on foot followed the carriages. Ah Cheow was a Chinese Free Mason, hence this unusual turnout and display. The big dragon flag and streamers floated from the flagstaff of their little Masonic Temple, various flags and banners were borne in the procession, appropriately Inscribed with Chinese characters and each of the Chinamen following the carriages, two and two, carried small flags, more or less in number, according to the degrees in their Masonry they had attained. Crowds of people lined the sidewalks, to the utter desertion of the churches, and although larger processions of the same kind are common enough in San Francisco, yet none could outdo this in genuine Celestial-American style and novelty. At the cemetery below town, where the Chinese have a little heathen corner to themselves, they had more music by both bands, a weak-voiced Mongolian sang a plaintively unmusical song, extolling the virtues of deceased and bidding him an eternal farewell, and after the candle-burning and other ceremonies were arranged, a good sized pork roast, the chicken and a few other provisions and sweetmeats were spread out for the benefit of the departed, but speedily [consumed] by sundry watchful Piutes and Shoshones as soon as the mourners had left the coast clear. The deceased had on his best clothes, hat, shoes and all, and also had small sums of Chinese money in each hand and in his mouth, therefore was supposed to have a good start, so to speak, for the next world. Being among the other interested observers before the procession started, I asked one intelligent looking Chinaman standing near the corpse:</p><p>""Why you no shut him eyes?""</p><p>""He no likes,"" replied he; ""we shut 'em plenty times, but he open 'em again.""</p><p>""Yes, but you should put pieces of money on them.""</p><p>""No, no; dat's bad; we never does dat; he couldn't see Joss.""</p><p>""That' so; but Ah Cheow had lots of money, didn't he, thousands of dollars; what's to be done with it?""</p><p>""No; he no money, he poor; he no gottee dam cent; but he Flee Mason, you see, De udder Masons put up plenty money to give him good funeral, you see. He no Flee Mason one cart nuff to take him 'long down. The Masons purty god for him, you see.""</p><p>POLITICAL</p><p>The late election news from the East naturally interests us all considerably, and Republicans feel rather jubilant over the general result, and especially over the general result, and especially over the rather amusing set-back Ben Butler got in Massachusetts. Old Ben has shown himself so anxious to ride into office regardless and unscrupulous as to what sort of, or how many political horses he used for the purpose, that to see him made to take a back seat altogether would be gratifying to his numerous political opponents. Local and State politics, although rather quiet again at present, will revive and become rampant before long, and keep stirred up spasmodically until the campaign is properly started.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>About this time our ladies are getting out in their best Winter rig and style, with new hats and other things to match. People like to dress well here, if they don't make a cent or pay their bills.</p><p>Coasting down the shady hillsides where the unmelted snow affords an opportunity is a favorite amusement with the Piute squaws as well as juvenile white Austinites.

The ranchers of both Reese River and Smoky Valleys have shown their ability and natural facilities in that respect by bringing in some big cages on wheels, of the aforesaid birds, and they find a very good market, at good prices. Seventeen pound turkeys are common, and raffling for all sized turkeys and chickens, as well as shooting for the same, is now fully in order. Some of our local pigeon shootists tried it on last Sunday. No very good shooting was done, but the best shooter got away with the most birds all the same.</p><p>THE STAR-ROUTE ARREST.</p><p>The recent arrest of Hon. G. E. Spencer, ex-United States Senator form Alabama, at this place, created no serious excitement. Spencer is well known in this section and was not hard to find. When Attorney General Brewster, at Washington, telegraphed to United States Marshal Corbett, of this State, that Spencer was wanted, L. P. Wardle, of Virginia City, and Al. Knuckols, of Cherry Creek, who were deputized, had no difficulty in capturing their man. Spencer is a pleasant gentleman and offered to armed resistance; in fact, when he left here on Tuesday morning last, en route to Washington, he looked like a man starting on a pleasure trip with a couple of invited friends. They will doubtless be his guests during the trip and while in Washington, and he may bring them back home with him. What specific effect this important arrest may have in the great Star-route investigation at Washington remains to be seen; anyhow it was not made anything of a local sensation here.</p><p>GONE EAST.</p><p>And now the newspapers say that John Mackay has also gone East on his telegraph business. The grievous decline in stocks would seem to indicate that such is the case, and that the hopeful little boom, presumably induced by his presence on the Comstock and in the city of Sin and stocks by the Golden Gate, had collapsed in consequence. The chances are that the sufferers in the outcome were not the brokers or the shrewd dealers. They knew Mackay's presence would make a comfortable little deal, regardless of any increased merit or good prospects in the mines, and they figured thereon, getting out nicely before MacKay got out for the East. When our Uncle James comes along, in a few weeks from now, look out for another boom, either up or down. But the small outside stock dealers are inclined to be distrustful when Fair comes, and do not care to shove up all their coin recklessly in honor of the occasion. In fact, the shrewdest among them are those who sail in when John comes, but judiciously copper the market when Uncle Jimmy is around. Yet after all, stock booms are somewhat like soap bubbles, beautiful while they last, and most attractive when most inflated. And when they collapse, the margins and ""soap"" as suddenly disappear. The manipulators of the suds can blow more bubbles as readily when they see fit, yet what mortal man has ever ascertained the thickness of a soap bubble?</p><p>RELICS.</p><p>And so they have found the old sledge that John Mackay used to practice with when mining in the Ophir twenty years ago. John, no doubt, played ""old sledge"" quite frequently in the early days, but the chances are that it is not easy to prove satisfactorily that John Mackay ever swung that identical old sledge. No wonder it was found to be badly rusted and the handle rotted off, after its long sleep in the upper levels. It must look as badly dilapidated as Rip Van Winkle's gun. Mr. Dadd has in his possession the field glass with which old Reese discovered Reese river. It is strongly microscopic, and had need to be, otherwise the river would never have been discovered with it. The cork slide at the top is somewhat decayed, but on removal the interior of the glass still retains a faint smell of whisky. He will contribute this interesting relic to the cabinet of the Reese River Pioneers.</p><p>ORE MILLING.</p><p>The Manhattan mill still continues its chronic and prosperous run, which has now lasted over a year. It is pounding right straight along in the even tenor of its way, and bids fair to keep doing so for the next year or two. There is plenty of ore in this section besides what is required to run this one mill; any amount of ledges containing ores rich in silver, more or less combined with base metals and minerals, are lying idle in the adjacent hillsides, and it seems strange that some enterprising capitalists do not venture a few of their rusty thousands in trying their luck with a new mill or a smelter. But perhaps the disastrous experience of the numerous mills built here in the early days is a sufficient warning to capitalists of the present time. They worked rich ores and charged huge prices, but somehow failed to win, and one after the other died and passed into the abyssmal pit of disastrous experimental history. I heard a queer little story the other day about one of these old pioneer rock smashers. It was down the canyon, below town, and had lots of work for a time, or until it bursted its proprietors and was moved out to White Pine. The cost of working the peculiar ores of this section was fearful, owing to lack of understanding and experiences, and even exorbitant rates, waste and other perquisites failed to produce affluent profits to the mill company. A mining man brought in a lot of ore from Yankee Blade, worth about $600 a ton, and had it put through the mill. After deducting all expenses, they paid him a balance in his favor of $7 50. He took it like a philosopher, thoughtfully put it in his hungry purse, and reflectively remarked: ""That's not a very big pile, considering the quality of the ore, but, after all, I s'pose I ought to be thankful for that much. You most certainly do work ore very close in this mill; very close; almighty close; in fact, I may say damn close; a little closer, and you'd have took it all.""</p><p>MULLEN'S BURIED TREASURE.</p><p>Since the recent death of Mullen, considerable quiet search has been made for the $40,000 or less of money or bullion he was reputed to have buried somewhere about here, and the locality of which he unfortunately was unable to reveal before delirium and death prevented. Sundry shrewd parties conversant with Mullen and his habits in life, where he worked and used to be seen going regularly, or at various times, or at various odd times, and as various localities have been judiciously putting in their picks, but thus far with no success whatever. It is said, however, that in tearing down his little old cabin, $11 was found in one chink of the wall, and $80 in another chink, almost sufficient to pay his funeral expenses. The foundations were also vigorously uprooted to the most hopeful extent, but with no further financial returns. The chances are against finding the main body of the treasure, yet some folks still have a wonderful faith therein. Let them dream on the problem, and work on it. They are sure to solve it somehow.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Under this head can come all sorts of irrelevant trash, like the ""local"" item headings of some newspapers nowadays, but this is not allowable in these letters.</p><p>Mr. Dadd, who attends all three of the churches regularly, is much pleased to observe the good attendance at each, and feels better for it every Sunday, and all through the week. There's novelty and variety to it for him. At one he says he holds copy while the preacher reads; at another he merely listens and watches the ceremonies, and at the third he credits the pulpit with considerable work and intelligent discussion.</p><p>Our Austin dry goods dealers have inaugurated a regular red-hot rivalry episode, like the famous ""clothing war"" on the Comstock a few years ago, when the miners and poor men of Virginia and Gold Hill were given a glorious opportunity to buy themselves rich and wear better clothes than they ever had before in their lives. I shall soon be able to appear in gorgeous array once more at little or no expense. A patient waiter is no loser.</p><p>The weather continues fine, but there is snow on the hillsides, and the Piutes wear blankets over or under their linen dusters. They live on pine nuts, and use the shells for fuel.</p><p>Spykens has found a ledge of argentiferous silica, which is rich in base metal of some kind. He is hopefully investigating it.   ALF.

TE36,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday……….December 9, 1883.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Congressional Notes and Propositions—Blood and Crime in the East—Something about Bondsmen—Sunset Gorgeousness—Fog and Ashes—Silver Bricks—What Headlight Oil is—Matrimonial—Gastronomic—Heel and Toe and Beautiful Snow.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., December 7, 1883.</p><p>The re-assembling of Congress is the principal item of exciting interest outside of local affairs, to us of Eastern Nevada. Yet even that does not much disturb the even tenor of our chronic equanimity. We keep somewhat of an interested eye, however, upon the doings of our Congressional Representatives, and do not forget to remember what we expect of them. And if they desire to remain in favor with their constituents, it will be well for them to bear this proposition in mind. No plans or political wires laid for re-election are half as effective as a handsome, well approved record of good stewardship—of faithful services rendered.</p><p>In the coming campaign Nevada’s Representatives at Washington, if they desire to continue in public favor, will have to render account to their constituents of their doings, and happy and successful may they be, if the popular verdict is: Well done good and faithful, etc., enter thou into the halls of Congress again.</p><p>A BOOM OF CRIME.</p><p>Why is it that the telegraphic wires from the East come laden at the present time with so many accounts of terrible murderous deeds and criminal horrors? Does the scent of blood come from some fresh murder, wafted upon the first cold breezes of Winter, get into the nostrils of the devilishly inclined, and excite them to competitive emulation in crime? The good people of the East, with plenty of churches and other arrangements to keep them good, have always been too readily inclined to consider the great, broad West, and especially California, Nevada and other newly-settled sections of the Pacific Coast, as semi-civilized, and the abode of all sorts of border ruffians, natural desperadoes, outlaws and blood-thirsty villains generally; yet we are always away behind Eastern wickedness in that respect. Occasionally somebody gets killed in an incidental row or a drunken fracas, or somebody is deliberately murdered for money, or some other quiet, mercenary motive, and the result is an occasional hanging; but wholesale butcheries, the slaughtering of whole families, and similar domestic horrors, such as we read of as occurring so frequently in various parts of the Atlantic States, are most gratifyingly absent from our criminal record. Our most noted desperadoes, murderers and scoundrels generally, come from the East; but there is evidently plenty of that element left to serve the devil and curse the reputation of the country.</p><p>THE LIABILITIES OF BONDSMEN.</p><p>Perhaps it is right that the bondsmen of your County Treasurer Nevin should be held responsible for his robbery. Perhaps it is right that public moneys taken forcibly by burglars should be forcibly restored by legal or illegal drafts upon the pockets of a few honest private citizens who have been accommodating enough to sign a bond merely that the Treasurer elected by the people may be enabled to assume and conduct the duties of the office. They signed Nevin’s bond, but presumably not that of the burglars. But they are held for the burglary, all the same. Legally this may be all right, but morally and socially it is not. They did not participate in the emoluments or financial benefits of the office, but are held responsible for an outside misfortune, so to speak, not contemplated or included in the election or official career of Nevin. Suppose a red-not streak of lightning should melt both vault and coin into one mass and drive it down to the lowest unproductive level of the Comstock, or suppose a gaping earthquake should swallow it; or suppose some bloody Britisher of the O’Donovan Rossa stamp, or other enemy of the Irish cause, should put a hatful of dynamite under the Treasury and blow Nevin and all sky-high, should his bondsmen be held responsible and be made to pay for it? A man may guarantee the financial honesty of his friend by signing his note, yet should that note happen to get lost or destroyed, the friendly responsibility ceases. These are interesting points for the consideration of all who may wish to show their financial vanity in the future by becoming sureties on the bonds of newly elected public officers. The best way to solve this problem would be for everybody hereafter to refuse to sign each and all such bonds and so let the thing work itself out.</p><p>THOSE GORGEOUS SUNSETS.</p><p>As regards those magnificent sunsets which have been so glowingly expatiated upon by the press of late throughout the Pacific Coast, I would simply remark that they have been very common here in Austin for years, in fact so common as not to have been considered worth mentioning. But they have always been esthetically appreciated and enjoyed, however, all the same, and it is gratifying to know that they have at length been observably extended to the Comstock and the rest of the Pacific Coast. Yet, judging from the various well-written and critical descriptions they can hardly be, elsewhere, more than mere reflections of Austin sunsets. And refulgently glowing as are those newspaper descriptions they do not, cannot do justice to the original subject. A genuine Austin sunset of the extra sort is a successive episode of golden, roseate, grandly-pervading glory that can only be witnessed and experienced with holy, heartfelt emotion. As the retiring God of Day slowly and impressively sinks below the serrated tops of the sagebrush-coated mountains he casts aloft diagonally across the cloud-embroidered sky long arms of golden light, as though giving his parting benediction. Then tier upon tier of silver and gilt-edged clouds, terraced one above the other, reflect back the grand overflow of glory, slowly changing from one glorious hue and combination of hues to another until the whole face of the western heavens is one noble, glowing panorama, painted by an immortal artist, whose pictures cannot be truly copied or even their colors transferred to human canvas. Even as the creeping, stealthy darkness glooms upward and gently erases the grand picture, the fading, dying hues still linger photographed upon the entranced vision and die pleasantly within the soul. Italian sunsets, or sunsets anywhere else are mere zephyr wool and crotchet finery as compared with a first-class Austin sunset.</p><p>WHAT THEY PORTEND.</p><p>Some newspaper authorities pretend to say that these gorgeous sunsets signify and prognosticate pleasant weather and a dry, open winter, while others set forth a directly contrary idea. Both are right to a certain extent. Some ascribe the cause of them to dry fog, others to atmospheric humidity; many say it is electricity, and one shrewd authority says they are caused by traveling clouds of ashes from volcanic eruptions in Alaska. Meanwhile the Manhattan mill pounds right steadily along, the mines are worked vigorously and well, and the resultant silver bricks are even more financially and mercenarily gratifying than even the most glorious sunset.</p><p>LUMINOUSLY EXPLANATORY.</p><p>Not to make light of anything connected with glorious brilliancy, I am reminded of old Bob’s explanation of the real nature and merits of that brand of kerosene ""Headlight Oil."" Old Bob is a Reese River pioneer, therefore is well posted and always adheres rigidly to the truth.</p><p>""When I was a-whalin’ in the old May and Marthy, way up in the Artic Ocean,"" said he, ""here’s the way we got our headlight ile. You see, boys, when you’ve got a whale alongside and cuttin’ him in, the blubber is taken off in long strips, or blanket pieces, just as you’d pare an apple or a pertater, the carcass of the whale turnin’ over and over in the water as the strips peel off in h’istin’ ‘em aboard; but fust of all we go for the head matter. A whale’s head is the biggest end of him, and we call it the case. All there is ter do is ter cut a hole in the top of it and bail out his brains with draw buckets. I’ve seen as high as twenty-eight bar’ls of it taken out of a single case, It’s whitish and mushy, but its where the spermacetty comes from, and the best ile. And that’s why they call it headlight ile.""</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Last Tuesday evening Warner Hillyer was married at St. George’s Church to Miss Christine White, a nice young lady of this place, about eighteen years of age. Hillyer is a nephew of Judge E. W. Hillyer, deceased, Curt. Hillyer and M. C. Hillyer, of your section. He is a young man, formerly well known in the Comstock region, and was a resident of Como in its palmy days. He has been in Reese River Valley and vicinity for the last few years, engaged in ranching and cattle-herding, and has picked up a few shells for himself, so he is considered tolerably well fixed and worthy of matrimony. He has many friends to wish him joy.</p><p>Colonel U. E. Allen, formerly member of the Legislature, and well known in your section, as well as here, occasionally aggravates his Austin friends by sending them bills of fare of the Scoville House Waterbury, Connecticut, of which hostelry he is major domo or commissary.

It is both pleasing and scientifically interesting to hear or read the various theories advanced as to the cause of this beautiful phenomenon, yet none give a perfectly satisfactory explanation any more than they could successfully diagnose those rich, red Northern lights during the last midsummer nights. Perhaps there may be some connection between the two, or that, as come shrewd savant recently sets forth, the transit of Venus is ding the business, that famous planet having worn a totally changed appearance since her recent notable drag across the face of the sun. Perhaps it may be the advance glow from the headlight of the new comet, now so rapidly approaching the earth. Stillwater Thompson, who is as shrewd and close an observer of heavenly phenomenon as any other Piute in this section, puts the whole thing in a pine-nut shell, as follows: “No sarby.”</p><p>BONANZA REDNESS.</p><p>The recent red-hot contest for the control of Ophir is more easily explained and understood, and many a shrewd, small outside manipulator of mining stocks hopefully predicts a red-hot boom in the market before many months, resulting from the uncovering of sundry rich ore bodies mythically situated in the lower levels of Ophir, the revelation of which has been interestedly deferred. Perhaps Coll Dean might now appropriately step to the front with some definite statement in that line.  Bonanza revelations are always in order. But in Ophir, of late years, they have always proven too stringy for any practical satisfaction. All these little circumstances, however, help out the stock market and assist in equalizing the distribution or concentration of money. Anyhow, it makes coin change hands, which is always gratifying to the general public.</p><p>BONANZA KING ASPIRATIONS.</p><p>In this connection it is quite interesting to note the movements of the famous bonanza kings, Mackay and Fair. They, as well as Flood, lovingly and lingeringly desire to hold on to the north end of the Comstock—the grand subterranean spring from whence they drew their overflowing, immense wealth, yet Flood seems to cling to the old groove more tenaciously than his other companions in Fortune’s smiles. Fair branched ambitiously and easily off into politics, seeking some indefinite degree of renown or notability in that direction, and now John Mackay, after quite a rambling vacation in Europe and America, or in frequent transit across the Atlantic between the two localities, suddenly and ambitiously steps out on top as a grand manipulator of telegraphic communication—a sort of Jupiter Tonans, as it were, to sling the wired lightning across mountain and plain and beneath the ocean, east and west, and other eligible points of the compass. He is actively and literally laying his wires to become the most popular of the three, as well as the richest—or the poorest—man in America. Fair emulously follows suit in the matter of public enterprise, but his old mining proclivities carry his aspirations in a subterranean direction after public approval. He desires to do his State service in the mater of striking more water where it is most needed, and has introduced a bill, in his Senatorial capacity, to promote the boring of artesian wells on Government lands in Nevada. Kendall and Cassidy bored a little on the same lead in times past, but they never struck water. Now if our genial and financially potent Uncle James will only succeed in tapping the basins of our sunken rivers, make Nevada’s mountain streams reappear above the alkali, and cause our deserts to blossom as the rose, all hands will rise right up in their boots and call him blessed. The movements of Mackay in lightning, and Fair in water will be regarded hereafter with more interest than even the most gorgeous sunsets.</p><p>UNFORTUNATE POSTMASTERS.</p><p>The third-class Postmasters of the Pacific Coast received a particularly rough stroke in the recent general reduction of salaries. It costs more to live, especially in Nevada and other interior sections, than it does in the East, therefore many a poor devil of a Postmaster stands shivering and undecided whether to continue honestly serving Uncle Sam, or starvation wages, or to throw up the sponge and go to robbing the stages for a living. Here, in Austin, the Postmaster has been particularly and peculiarly unfortunate. The disastrous cloudburst and flood of August, 1874, swept away the Postoffice entirely, fixtures and all, and it was only by the liveliest and most indomitable exertions that the mails were saved. Again, by the big fire in September, 1881, was the Austin Postoffice totally obliterated. On both occasions the mails alone were saved, and at the expense of the office fixtures, boxes and all similar necessary public conveniences, which, under the laws of the Department, have to be furnished and maintained by Postmasters themselves. This unfortunate Postmaster has applied to the Department for adequate reimbursement or relief in the matter, and may be properly heard and responded to, if he should live long enough, but red tape official justice is slow, very slow, even in America.</p><p>THE OLD BANGER.</p><p>The Manhattan mill, in this place, is one of the most persistent old ore smashers in the country. It does all the ore reduction, and bullion production of this district and vicinity, and, as stated in a previous letter, its present run, commencing October 28, over a year ago, has been continuous ever since with the exception of a few days’ pause for absolutely necessary repairs. The chances are that it will have to stop before long for a thorough overhauling and preparation for another long run. But it will not stop for lack of ore, for there is plenty on top, plenty in sight, plenty in reserve and plenty in prospective, and rich ore at that. These mines are exceedingly well managed, and judiciously worked with an eye both to the present and future supply, and steadily continuous, profitable output. This fact is significantly attested to by the regular, unfailing shipment of silver bricks every day or two, assaying over $1,000 apiece.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>Ducks and geese are plenty, and tolerably cheap, the Piutes are bringing them in from the Humboldt, as well as from eligible neighboring localities. But they stick to good prices and will not sell a duck for two bits unless he is stale or otherwise unprofitable.</p><p>A sad accident occurred last Sunday when a little ten-year-old boy, picking into the merits of an innocent-looking giant powder cap or exploder which his still smaller brother had found, had his left hand blown off and was otherwise so badly injured that he died next morning. The moral to this is too obvious and frequent, yet naturally to be continued.</p><p>George H. Morrison, of your section, engaged in collecting data and material for Bancroft’s History of Nevada, was here the other night, arriving by private conveyance overland from Carson, and left next morning for Ruby Valley, Eureka and otherwheres in the eastern part of the State. He proposed returning here in a few days to stop awhile. George is a popular gentleman and has many friends here.</p><p>John Booth, of the Reveille, is getting rich some more. He has the model newspaper of this section, filling the wants of the community in that respect, consequently he is deservedly doing an excellent business. The old Reveille show for itself.</p><p>Politics is a subject which is laid over for the holidays, like the adjournment of Congress for that purpose. But Austin is sure to join with the rest of Eastern Nevada in the grand turmoil and trouble of the coming political campaign of next year, and nobody need forget it.</p><p>Somebody has located a skating rink on Main Street, on a vacant lot just opposite the Court-house. But he has got it on the wrong side of the street.

It was not the first time there had been a man, but this man was more manish than other men of his day and generation. His name was Horton, and he hailed from Baltimore. I first knew him as a California gold miner, working on Woods' creek, a tributary of the Tuolumne, in the Winter of '49. He was a dark complexion, full bearded six-footer, strong as a young giant, with a peculiar massiveness of countenance, and general style of character naturally attracting the attention of most any one who saw him. He was a hard worker and always had plenty of money, spent it freely, but never seemed contented to work long in any one place. In fact he seemed to be naturally a prospector, and found more new and rich spots to work in than anybody. Two years afterward I met him at Hart's Bar on the Calaveras, still delving away with pick, shovel and cradle, and still working spending plenty of money. He left shortly afterward, and I did not see him again till August 27, 1855. It was at Volcano, Amador county. There had been a Democratic mass meeting that evening, and Governor John Bigler, Colonel J. C, Zabriskie and James Farley had addressed the citizens from a stand on the main street. Suddenly there was a row in a saloon, and I saw a light-built fellow trying to defend himself against two burly rascals who were attacking him most viciously. No weapons were used, but the young man struck out with his fists very lively. They had him backed up against the wall and were getting the best of him. Just then a stranger, riding on a mule, paused for a moment in front of the door, and the next instant he leaped to the ground, brushed past me, and directly formed a fourth party in the fight. He knocked the two big men right and left, had them both on the floor at a time, then stood over them, knocking them down every time they attempted to rise. The young fellow took the opportunity to slip out, and the stranger coolly marched up street, leading his mule to a stable. His floored antagonists seemed really thankful for a chance to arise, and philosophically wiped their bloody noses without evidently caring to follow up such a disagreeably vigorous acquaintance. But I followed him, though, for I had recognized Horton. He explained thus:</p><p>""You see, I've been down on James' Bar, below Mokelumne Hill, the last three months, and done first rate; but I got tired and concluded to try the Fiddletown diggings. I was a little late getting to this place and shall go on early in the morning; but, really, now, I did happen along in good time to interfere in a one-sided muss. Never was here before, but hope those two chaps down there won't think harder of me on that account.""</p><p>He camped with me that night; we ate beans together, talked over old times, and before sunrise he was on his mule and his way to Fiddletown. I never saw or heard of him afterward until last Sunday, yet I recognized him at once by his strong, massive features and self-possessed manner. His dark hair had become considerably tray-mixed, and he did not walk up street with his old, independent swing. He was simply Horton, thirty years later. But he was the same hearty, whole-souled man as of yore.</p><p>""I've had lots of experience since then,"" said he, ""and handled just as much money as I desired. Have been all up and down the coast, yet never have lacked good food and good clothes and a good place to sleep. Worked the last ten years around Nevada City and Grass Valley, and only been in this State six months. Got in last evening across the country from the Candelaria and Hawthorne section. Good mines over there, but I don't like their kind. Now I'm going on to Osceola to prospect those gold diggin's, and the chances are that next thing I shall get out of this cussed sagebrush range, and back again over in God's country. Don't you know, sometimes I think I'm getting old enough to quit prospecting, and that I'll settle down on a ranch and get me a wife. Must have somebody to leave my gold dust to when I go under the daisies. Adios, old pard; you're getting a little gray, too. Call over and see me in the sweet by and by, on my ranch, you know.""</p><p>On his ranch! He'll never settle down on a ranch. Bless his grizzled beard and big heart, he is too inveterate an old prospector for that. He always seemed to me to be cut out for a very different style of man; a leader among men, socially, intellectually or politically, yet somehow he never took the lead, except as a pioneer and a prospector. Verily, ""there's a divinity that shapes our ends,"" and the future history of this old timer will be interesting to study, for he can but follow out his manifest destiny, finish digging his grave, and tramp more and more wearily onward after the numerous old pioneers gone before him over the well-worn trail, out into the mythical beyond.</p><p>OLD COMSTOCKERS.</p><p>Writing about the aforesaid old California prospector, calls to mind the numerous old residents of Virginia and Gold Hill to be found everywhere throughout Eastern Nevada. When adversity descended, like a cold fog, upon the Comstock they had to seek homes and employment elsewhere, but your old-time Comstockers never forget what they remember, and longingly hope for a renewal of bonanza days, willing and ready to rush back to the hoped-for revival at short notice. And as they thus hopefully dream of better times, they gently hum: ""Oh, carry me back to old Virginny."" But most of them are too poor to get back there any other way.</p><p>MANHATTAN BRICKS.</p><p>The old Manhattan mill has just started on a fresh run, after a couple of weeks' rest for repairs and a thorough clean-up. A gratifying peculiarity with this institution, is that its bullion yield is chronically continuous, the regular shipments of bricks being made every other day, or oftener, whether the mill runs or not. In fact, some of the heaviest shipments have been made since the mill shut down. A thorough clean-up of this mill, literally means something, and something elaborately valuable. Crushing the ore by the Stedefeldt dry process involves the gradual accumulation of light, rich chloride dust everywhere, as well as in the regular dust chambers and other traps. The whole concern has to be scraped and swept from one end to the other, and the pans are thus kept working long after the batteries have ceased their noisy racket. Just what bricks have [been] turned out in the way of bullion shipments during these two weeks that the mill has shut down, would make any newspaper man feel remarkably rich, and financially comfortable.</p><p>OUR NARROW GAUGE</p><p>Railroad between here and Battle Mountain, ninety-three miles, is a more profitable concern than it has been. This is not by reason of any reduction of freights and fares, but in the greater economy of management, running less trains, or only enough to fill the requirements, and in the total abolishment of the dead-head system. No free passes are allowed, even to the clergy, little children or officers of the road. The conductor is the only man allowed a free pass, which is obviously good policy in that respect. Moreover, it is to the benefit of the road, as well as to Austin, that impecunious scrubs cannot get here without putting up or walking. The other railroads in this State may be financially demoralized by the free pass, dead-head system, but not the Nevada Central.</p><p>OUR HOLIDAYS</p><p>Passed off very nicely here in Austin, and all the children, as well as many of the grown folks, received Christmas and New Year's presents in abundance, mail and railroad facilities bringing in many from outside, to say nothing of the affluent abundance to be found in the stores. The toy and fancy goods trade was better than it has been for years, and Wright, Sower and others in that line increased their personal wealth very materially.</p><p>ALF.

Anyhow, the temperature here is numerously variable, and it is no trick whatever for a nice, Spring-like day to wind up with a vicious zero freeze. As to that matter, the average Austin thermometer slides up or down the scale as if it were greased. A fellow finds his ears and mustache freezing from no apparent cause, and on looking at the thermometer finds it away down among the lower zeros. Then he for the first time realized that it is cold. But the greatest difficulty that the skating rink projectors heretofore mentioned, on Main street, have to contend with, is the porousness of the soil. They poured on the water, and plenty of it, but the porous soil took it in like a sponge. A cold snap caught some of the water before it could soak away, and since then, by frequently and judiciously irrigating the surface of the ice, they have at last succeeded in forming a pretty good rink upon which skaters may amuse themselves with perfect safety, knowing that if they could break through, they would be in no danger from drowning, but more from suffocation with dust.</p><p>REESE RIVER ICE.</p><p>Speaking ice, Joaquin Patargo, who cuts up Reese river every Winter, and hauls it to town for Summer use, complains that he has not been able to get over two feet in thickness of ice thus far this season. Last Winter it froze five feet deep, or away down into the mud, compelling the catfish to burrow deeper for safety. This depth of water or thickness of ice can, of course, only be secured by damming the river. This he did this season in good time, therefore has it all secured, and will finally bring it to town, leaving the catfish to depend upon the Spring thaw from the headwaters for desired irrigation. Reese river catfish, however, although you may dig them up like potatoes, don't seem to mind it so long as there is any moisture at all in the soil, but are willing to wait till water comes. Mr. Dadd gives me these facts in piscatorial experience, corroborated and verified by Joaquin himself. They are both prominent members of the Society of Reese River Pioneers, consequently can be depended upon as perfectly reliable. And I have noticed myself that the genuine Reese river catfish have snouts or noses like hogs, made especially for rooting or burrowing in dry weather, and also have a pouch in each cheek, like a gopher.</p><p>THE NEW COMET</p><p>Has become stale in the estimation of Austinites. It has an extremely insignificant look, and is evidently a two bits a bushel affair, and as for any extra merit claimed for it on account of having two tails, that's nothing. Four tails and an extra set of legs would not add any dignity to its pusillanimous appearance. It comes in with the grand red sunsets, and can best be seen as the sunsets fade away into nightly darkness, yet it is apparently too insignificant and not influential enough to produce these famous and truly remarkable sunsets. It will be observed that this glowingly redolent phenomenon still continues, regardless of all theories. It is simply a peculiarity of the season. Only this, and nothing more.</p><p>THE FINAL ENDING.</p><p>Fannie Schuyler, one of the demi-monde, died of pneumonia last Friday. She was about thirty-six years of age, as near as she could remember, and was formerly well known in your city in the flush times. Many will recollect her as a very pretty woman, with a neat, doll-like complexion and appearance, but whisky, opium and general dissipation destroyed her beauty and made her a wreck. She came to Austin immediately after the great fire of October 26, 1875, and here remained, continuing her downward career. She was quiet and inoffensive and evidently her own worst enemy. Her funeral was quite largely attended by people of her own class and others, and she received decent burial in the public cemetery below town. In accordance with her request no minster officiated. An ancient colored woman, known as ""Old Car'line,"" read a hymn; there was some singing, and the hearse was followed by a large hack, three buggies, one omnibus, two grocery wagons and a butcher cart, containing those attending the funeral. Her real name was Margaret Ann Dumarsh; she was of Canadian parentage, and a native of Watertown, New York. Whatever may have been the primary inducing causes of her downward career in life were best known to herself, but it may be a consolation to the poor creature's relatives to know that she received proper care at the final ending and decent burial.</p><p>THE CURFEW BELL.</p><p>Owing to the tendency of our young Austin boys to gravitate toward hoodlumism and get into bad company and follow bad habits after dark, the Board of Commissioners concluded to make them go home at night and not run the streets any more. A town ordinance was accordingly passed to that effect, and now form the tower of the hall of Eagle Engine company, No. 3, rings aloud the curfew bill every evening, at 8 o'clock, giving just eight taps as a warning for the boys to vanish homeward or be arrested. The boys tumbled to the racket forthwith, not willingly but judiciously, knowing that the entire police force stood ready and watching to gobble them up unless they could show authoritative permission from parents or guardians, or that they were on errands, or in the discharge of some legitimate duty. At all public entertainments heretofore, especially theatrical, etc., these boys have been a very serious source of annoyance to both performers and audience, crowding the back seats and entry and driving decent people wild with their yells, shrieks, whistling and stamping. It had to be stopped. This ordinance is a most excellent one, operates well, and other towns and cities besides Austin might adopt the same plan to very good advantage.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>The importance of the coming political campaign is very well appreciated, but the political pot does not boil very fiercely as yet; in fact, it is hardly time. The shrewdest question on the political docket for consideration is, Who is to succeed Jones as United States Senator from Nevada. The chances are that he will be a candidate to succeed himself, in view of which proposition those who do not like Jones are trying hard to study up some man to beat him. This point is not easily decided, with the material at hand, but some kind of a Joshua may come in to the rescue between now and November. We shall see.</p><p>GONE PROSPECTING.</p><p>Harry Bluett, formerly well known among the miners of the Comstock, but for the last few years an active worker in the subterranean operations of Austin, left here yesterday morning for Butte, Montana. He proposes prospecting that section of the country for a few months but will of course return, unless he can do better there than here. He struck a good pitch or so in these mines last year, and paid a visit to his relatives and friends in England. He also got married, and was going to take his wife on a prospecting expedition to Mexico, but the prevalence of yellow fever there prevented, so he left his wife in the cold country and came back. But he has sent for her, and expects to meet her here in the sweet by and by, when he, too, like scores of others who have tried it, shall have come to the conclusion that Montana, with her nickel-souled population from the East, is no profitable or congenial community for an old Comstock Nevadan. Anyhow, Harry is a very popular gentleman, with lots of friends to wish him the best of luck.</p><p>VENUS.</p><p>Old Joe was drunk again last evening, and, as usual, waxed sentimental. He held up a telegraph pole on the street corner and gazed fondly and reverentially upon the red sunset and the comet, and especially upon Venus, thus rapturously soliloquizing as he gazed: ""Dear gor-blessed old Veny, night after night I've watched you patiently transitin' arosser face of the sun, yet other folks failin' ter reckernize yer. But old Joe recks'nize yer, betcher ribs, old gal. Won't throw off on yer for no damn snide of a two-tail comet, either. But, sh-h-h! here comes Mrs. B., a-huntin for me. Good-bye, old Veny, gorbless yer. Adios."" Right here his home regulator seized him gently by the collar and elbow and dragged him off up a side street.</p><p>The clouds have rolled by, and the weather is milder, sunshiny and genial.

And it was noticeable that they passed off to the westward. The comet, also, is about played out; but the snow remains in all its original purity, and plenty of it for the present. Old settlers say there has not been so heavy a snowfall for years along the Toiyabe range and in Smoky Valley as was deposited by the recent storm. Between here and Belmont the depth of the snow is variously estimated at from two to twenty feet. Indeed, an old Reese River pioneer, who came in from a scouting raid in that direction, pledges me his word that he found the snow over forty feet deep in some places, and still coming down at the rate of a foot an hour, ""every flake big as a flapjack,"" and that he waded over ten miles that way without a drink of whisky. He describes his sufferings as something fearful, but he had no snowshoes, and when he tells of any one of his venerated old kind traveling ten miles without whisky, under any circumstances whatever, I know he lies.</p><p>CHINA NEW YEAR</p><p>Was ushered in after the true Celestial style by our numerous Mongolian fellow citizens. The noisy, infernal racket of crackers, bombs and heavy torpedoes blew up the latent stinks and thoroughly fumigated Chinatown, but as they do the same thing on the Fourth of July or any other proud occasion, the Piutes are thrown into a state of perpetual wonder as to its real signification. Sam Kee, the washman, came around smiling and treated every one of his numerous patrons to a cigar. He said his lily, Soi Sin Fwar (Water-God Flower) was in full bloom that day, insuring him luck and prosperity for the year; therefore his celestial goose hung particularly high. All the Johns and Sams put on their most stylish rig, had their tails freshly braided, and went around calling. The women, too, wore their best dungaree pants, bloomingest paint, nobbiest hair-pins and gayest handkerchiefs, and in all the principal houses were nice little lay-outs of cakes, sweetmeats, nuts, rice brandy, cigars, etc., for all who would partake. The chief drummer and the B flat gong performer lost heavily at ""tan"" the night before, and got drunk; therefore, there was none of their inspiring strains to mar the festivities of the occasion, but the big dragon flag and various streamers floated above the smoke and hilarious explosive din, and the moon-eyed sons and daughters of Confucius grinned at each other, exchanged salutes, and were happy, if nothing else.</p><p>STOX.</p><p>It is rather refreshing to note the present little boom in stocks by way of agreeable variety from the universal apathetic monotony which has so long ruled the market. From conversation with parties who have been there and seen, there is little doubt that another very rich prospect is opened up in the Bodie mine. How extensive and expensive the new development is, remains to be seen; but it is sufficient to cause a lively stir in stocks, and give somebody a chance to get even, some to get rich; and many to get broke. The rich strike in that mine a few years ago was well groomed and boomed in the newspapers. Yet newspaper men are not the ones who reap the profit on these interesting occasions. They always do their best to represent and truly set forth the mining resources and prospects of their respective localities, as well of the State generally, but they simply beat the bush for somebody else to catch the bird. The assessment of $8 per share just levied on Northern Belle is a stunner to most people. With the stock selling at ten cents, it looks like a ridiculously bad business proposition, in fact, financial suicide to pay that assessment. But just wait till about the time it is delinquent, or sale day approaches, and the chances are that some sort of a boom will be worked up, through the newspapers, inducing hopeful stockholders to continue in the good faith, and send more good money after bad. Without the newspapers Northern Belle would not be dead and buried, with no possible hope of resurrection. But so it has been in the history of the Comstock---the newspapers always showed up all mining development to the very best advantage, and worked up the stock booms, yet somebody else always reaped the harvest, and though millions were thereby made by other people, the newspaper men remained poor; the crumbs falling to them from the rich man's table being merely a profitless aggravation in the way of excited hopes.</p><p>THE MINING OUTLOOK</p><p>At the present time, generally speaking, it not particularly healthy. Many localities in this section and elsewhere in the State which were producing bullion a year ago are not doing so now, and assessments are levied on mines that were paying dividends. Some new and good prospects have been developed in the Carson and Colorado Railroad section, the most ponderous and perhaps the most profitable being the Mount Cory, yet the real success of even that development is not yet fully demonstrated. After all, the old Comstock holds out about as well as any of them. It is true her big bonanza days seems to have departed, yet let it not be forgotten that her probabilities and hopes of future bonanzas are still good, and not departed by any means. It is an absurdity on the part of any newspaper to speak of the Comstock as lost to the wealth of the State when the grand old lode is still producing more bullion and employing more labor and capital than any other mine or mining section in the State. Small ledges, let them be ever so rich, can be and are completely worked out, leaving simply the shell with not even low grade ore for future reference, but not so with the Comstock. Many very rich spots have been worked out, yet there is plenty of room for more to be found, and a whole vast wilderness of low-grade ore developed, which can be and is building profitably worked. When the long purses get tired of rushing down into the hot lower levels of the lode, where for years they have expensively delved and found nothing, or go back and pay more attention to explorations above the level of the Sutro tunnel, where all the bonanzas have been found, then renewed prosperity will reign along the Comstock. One straight-forward, practical mining man at the south end, in the Gold Hill section, has followed this idea for years, and has been the only one to make money. He has naturally and deservedly got rich in so doing. What one man has done many others may do. There is plenty of room in the upper workings of the broad Comstock belt, among the affluence of low-grade ore, for more rich bonanzas to be found and some time in the future, when a different policy is pursued, they will be found.

Coal oil only costs six bits a gallon here, and a gallon will start several fires. In fact, we all remember when even a bottle full, judiciously applied, has started a fire destroying a goodly section of Virginia City, or made insurance policies available in Gold Hill. During the last two or three years we haven't had a fire worth mentioning in Austin, and the insurance companies have a soft, lucrative thing of it. This is doubtless owing to the known alertness and efficiency of our Fire Department. Yes, and now it is proposed to buy a lot of Harkness' Fire Extinguishers and distribute them in convenient localities all along Main street. Just imagine a lamp explosion in a toy shop, and forty-seven active citizens rushing madly in, each with a sort of soda fountain or mammoth syringe on his back, and playing forty-seven streams upon the flames, or upon each other, the interest of the occasion still further heightened by the sudden arrival of the Fire Department with big hose nozzles and deluges of water from numerous hydrants. Many a big conflagration has been prevented by the timely arrival and well directed potency of a Babcock fire extinguisher, and the Harkness is said to be even more effective. A gallon of prevention is better than a whole reservoir of cure, sometimes. Mr. Delosse, agent of the Harkness, who is here introducing them, gave a public test day before yesterday which was very satisfactory, and our gallant fire ladies kindly refrained from drowning him with water from their machines, same as was done with Murdock, agent for the Babcock, when he gave a big public test in Virginia City several years ago, with the old volunteer department on hand ready to guard against any possible danger from the fire getting away. Anyhow, whether needed or not, several Harknesses will be disposed of here, and Delosse will be at a loss to explain where de loss comes in, so far as he is concerned.</p><p>FROZEN WATER PIPES</p><p>Are disagreeably prevalent, and many a cuss word is directed at obstinate faucets which unexpectedly refuse to give down. Water seekers rush desperately from house to house, with pails and pitchers, and all whose water pipes are sick send for McGinnis at once. He is kept at work day and night. Joe McGinnis is as much of a public character in that line as ""Water Mac"" used to be in Gold Hill and Virginia. Down in Reese River Valley, at Battle Mountain and all along the line of the Central Pacific the thermometer during the recent cold snap got away down among the lower zeros, from thirty to fifty degrees, the latter figure being reached at Elko. Austin's coldest was about ten degrees below zero, in the shade. Such cold nights make a fellow wish he was a Mormon.</p><p>JARNDYCE VS. JARNDYCE.</p><p>The famous lawsuit of Harris vs. Harris, clothing dealers, etc., here and in San Francisco, came up again in the District Court, before Judge McKenney, last week. It is a sort of diamond cut diamond arrangement, with intervening and side suits to assist in mixing things up most perplexingly, and the numerous lawyers employed are all getting fat. Our local lawyers are all into the suit, and when the legal brigade from San Francisco, Sacramento and elsewhere came in and joined forces, last week, Austin was right lively and the saloons and restaurants did fine business. The lawyers are all provident enough to draw adequate fees at each trial phase of the case, and adjourn or postpone it as often as they can. So, last week they just got fired up right, and people thought there would be a two or three weeks' session of the case, when it was suddenly blocked by adjournment till May. Then it is proposed to commence anew, changing shifts so far as Judge is concerned. Four fresh Judges are given to select from, and by judicious changes, from time to time, the Harris vs. Harris case may be kept for an indefinite length of time in chancery, so to speak, like the famous suit of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, mentioned in Dickens' works.</p><p>ST. VALENTINE</p><p>Was very much celebrated yesterday, and Postmaster Gibson was driven wild with extra work, handling all sorts and sizes of valentines, many of them as big as barn windows. But the easily folded, more hideous and popular kind predominated. Most everybody received a valentine of some sort; but those who expected, and didn't receive, just went and bought the roughest they could find and directed them themselves to themselves. And these were the most proudly hilarious in showing to admiring friends their valentudinous acquisitions. Business men and respectable citizens were not exempt from severe valentine inflictions and atrocities. Jack Lisle, the restaurant man, got five horrible things, so diabolically reflecting upon his manner of feeding his patrons, his personal appearance and general character, that he miserably walked off down to the cemetery and wanted to die. Then there was a sedate, professional man, who got his keenest sensibilities dreadfully harrowed up by a huge picture of a cat—sent all the way from Reno—a fierce old tom cat, viciously gazing at the moon from a house-top, and gently caroling: ""Hinc illae lachrymae."" He regards it as the ghost of a bad cat which he caused to die not long ago, and feels retributively unhappy. The festivities of the day wound up last night with a grand valentine party at International Hall.</p><p>ORE AND BRICKS.</p><p>The mines here are turning out a goodly amount of extra good ore about now. It is of very high grade, some assaying up into the thousands per ton, and coming, as it does, from the lower levels of the Manhattan Company's mines, it shows very conclusively that the ore does not deteriorate, either in quality or quantity, as greater depth is attained, but quite the contract. This ruby silver ore from the condensed narrow ledges peculiar to this locality is the most beautiful silver ore in the world, and its honest richness is properly attested to by the almost daily shipments of ten bricks, worth over $1,000 Hinc illae brix.</p><p>NARROW GAUGE.</p><p>Notwithstanding the total suspension of the entire free list on the Nevada Central, between here and Battle Mountain, the receipts of the road have not fallen off to any appreciable extent, and the annual dividends to stockholders will not be interrupted. That gallant little narrow-gauge has become a prime necessary of life to this community. All the trains rush to and fro on time, regardless of the weather, and snow never cuts off the communication as on the great Central Pacific. The track is always kept clear and open by the millions of cattle in the valley tramping down the snow as they use the track for a convenient thoroughfare in passing through the sagebrush.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>During the coldest of the recent cold snap, Stillwater Thompson, Captain Bob and other Piute chiefs had to wear as high as seven linen dusters in order to keep warm, and the squaws all wound barley sacks around their feet and ankles, and away up till they waddled badly, and their tracks in the cold snow were precisely like unto those famous prehistoric tracks in the State Prison quarry near Carson.</p><p>The Skating rink on Main Street has been made a glorious success by the cold weather, and its proprietors have become so wealthy that they have changed their names to Vanderbilt and Gould.</p><p>A lodge, wigwam or branch of the Young Men's Christian, etc., has been organized here, with a very flourishing membership and outlook. These juvenile Christians will not allow themselves to skate, drink, fish or fiddle on Sundays hereafter, but will attend more to mutual improvement and to the acquiring of further facilities in that line, extending the same to all who desire to join. It is a real good idea.</p><p>""Quijotoa."" We have all read ever so much about it and its splendid bonanza prospects, but can't somebody tell the correct pronunciation of the word? Its derivation, definition, etymology, topography and all that sort of thing have been well ventilated, but won't somebody tell what syllable or syllables the accent comes upon?

TE42,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday. . . . . . . . . . March 2, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Shutting Down of the Manhattan Mill—Rich Sweepings and General Clean—up—Bullion Shipments—Mill Saturation and Human Bodily Richness—A Prosperous Milling run—Good Bullion Yield for Reese River District—About the Mines—Lovely Ruby Silver Veins—Excellent, Advantageous and Successful Mining Management—Present and Future Prospects—Telegraphic—Political—Society Notes—Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., February 29, 1884.</p><p>Our great ore reducer and bullion producer, the Manhattan mill, has at last shut down to take a rest. It shut down on Wednesday of last week, so far as the stamps were concerned, but the pan department kept running for the rest of the week, and, in fact, did not get through with the clean-up until last Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>A CLEAN-UP</p><p>Of the Manhattan mill means something more than with ordinary mills. Being operated by the dry crushing, Stedefeldt process, working rich ore, it becomes loaded with rich chloride dust from one end to the other. Commencing at the reception and battery end, it has to be swept clean throughout every department, and the extensive furnace flue dust chambers, through the intricate winding passages of which the dry-floured ore or pulp has to pass a distance of about 500 feet to the tall, main brick chimney or stack, all are swept clean as soon as sufficiently cooled to permit. These sweepings, added to the accumulated pulp at the furnace when the batteries stop, keep the pan department well and most lucratively employed for some days, for these sweepings are decidedly rich, as shown by the daily shipments of ten bullion bricks, each brick worth over $1,000. Yet, even now, as the old mill stands, thoroughly swept and cleaned out, it is completely saturated with rich chloride ore fumes throughout, even to the shingles on the broad roofs, and were the whole concern to burn up, or down, the ground it covers would pay splendidly to run through amalgamating pans, following up its regular old yield of ten bricks a day for a week. Yes, and then it would pay well to cremate Superintendent Charley Durning, James Robinson, the ore weigher and sampler, and James Sullivan, the furnace manager, all three of whom have worked amid the dust of the mill for so many long years that they, also, have become thoroughly saturated with the richest chloride.</p><p>A PROSPEROUS RUN.</p><p>Occasionally, during the last few years, owing to scarcity of ore in the mine, the mill has only been able to make short runs of three or four months at a time, then having to wait for an adequate ore accumulation before starting up again. This last run commenced on the 28th of October, 1882, and has been continuous with the exception of one or two brief stoppages, for a period of sixteen months, being the longest run for some years. It does not close now from lack of ore entirely, but to make a general overhauling, especially in the pan department, where the old pan frames have been giving considerable trouble, and have to be renewed. The mill will be put in complete repair throughout, meanwhile allowing some weeks' time for a good accumulation of ore, not only at the mill, but at the dumps and ore houses of the various mining works. The result of the sixteen months run is pretty good for an old mill out in the country, grinding up a lot of little narrow ledges. During that period it reduced 8.306 tons of ore, and produced therefrom silver bullion to the amount of $1,662,000, the average yield being a little over $200 per ton. Of course the ore varies very much in value, form below $100 per ton to up in the thousands, but the average output of the mill has been very steadily continuous in the way of regular bullion shipments—ten bars at a time, each brick worth over $1,000. This is essentially silver bullion, the very small proportion of gold contained in it not being taken into consideration. The Manhattan has been the only working mill here for some years past, and from its records, as well as other sources, the yield of Reese River mining district, including neighboring ores milled here, has thus far amounted to over $30,000,000. The Manhattan still averages $1,000,000 a year, right straight along.</p><p>THE MINES.</p><p>It must be borne in mind that although the ore averages so richly the expense of extraction and reduction is much greater here than where the ledges are large, with plenty of free-milling ores. The numerous veins are fames for their narrowness and uncertainty as well as for their richness. The ore belt is about as wide as the Comstock, and the veins are comparatively as numerous as the veins in the human body; yes, and comparatively as large, being from two inches to two or three feet in width, and from three to six inches on the average. And they may appropriately be termed varicose veins, bunching out in places and pinching out in others, with an occasional aneurism that pays big. And the simile holds good in the ruby silver character of the ore composing these pretty little veins, showing streaks and spots like human blood. These mines have been and still are very systematically and carefully worked, most excellent mining judgment and engineering skill controlling the whole. Were they not thus managed, under the most complete, thoroughly-organized system, they could not be made to pay. The past shows for itself, and the future continues very promising. These mines have not yet been worked more than one-third as deep as the Comstock, so far as actual depth is concerned. The veins lie at such a flat angle that the principal incline, the Paxton, has penetrated from the surface some 1800 feet, following  the ledge, or vein, and yet an hardly be considered to have reached 1000 feet below the surface. About 40 men are given employment, nearly half of whom work on lease or contract. Quite a number of prospecting mines are also worked outside of those belonging to the Manhattan Company, but this company regulates and controls the situation. The amount of ore in sight in the various workings of the company is not so good as at the commencement of the recent long run of the mill, yet the showing at all points continues healthy and very promising, and the exceedingly rich character of the ore holds out well at the very lowest depths attained. Some of the richest ruby and stephanite ore ever found here has been produced lately from the lower levels. Owing to the breakages in the veins and general uncertainties, a vast amount of dead work has to be done, and even in bonanza times, when there is plenty of rich ore insight, there is no cessation of prospecting work, with a view to future resources. As before remarked, good practical mining judgment and careful engineering has to be constantly brought to bear, and vigilant watchfulness at all points. The Manhattan Company does not pay dividends at present, but it pays all its bills, needs no assessments, and keeps things running on a solid foundation. The which proposition is pretty good in itself for this community.</p><p>TOO MUCH OF A NOT GOOD THING.</p><p>Why is it that the telegrams from the East are allowed to consist so largely of items unimportant to people of this section generally. It is well enough to state that the Ohio river is up and flooding a large portion of North America, but the vast majority of people on this coast did not come from Ohio, and never even washed in that limpid stream. Consequently, the harrowing details of the sweeping away of pig pens and chicken coops, as well as the specified inches in rise or fall at all the numerous points up and down the river, are of local importance and interest more to Ohioans who are not running for the Presidency than to the general public, for whom newspaper telegrams are supposed to be intended. And so with European telegrams. What the blazes do we care about knowing that Bismarck has the belly-ache? Why physic the telegraph with so much trashy truck? Yet now John Mackay is stringing cables across the ocean, and more wires all over the country, with a new invention which is to give us ever so much more telegraphic facilities than we ever dreamed of before. There is too much of the thing already. If, however, Mackay will succeed in killing about seven-eighths of the present telegraphic noodle reporters and substituting something more practically useful, he will receive the blessing of all sensible newspaper men and the suffering public generally.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>I notice that the Republican State Central Committee is to hold a meeting next Monday in your city. This will be the first meeting of the campaign, and the most important in many respects. It will arrange time and place for the State Convention, give apportionment of delegates thereto, and give other pertinent details of work to be laid out for the campaign. And it should be borne in mind that the Democracy have a special eye to the present campaign, which is likely to prove the most important in the political history of the country. A great responsibility rests upon the action of the present republican committee, and they had better bear this fact in mind, and be careful about making any false moves on the political checker board.</p><p>SOCIETY NOTES.</p><p>The skating rink on Main street has been considerably improved by the recent thaw. A man may skate about and imagine that he is a steamboat skipping through the water, and even the ladies, when they happen to slip up, and come down, can imagine themselves taking a sitz bath, cooling and nice, like mopping up a dining-room floor.</p><p>Austin youngsters are, as a general rule, not worse than the youngsters of other good localities in this State, but at least one youth came to deserved grief the other evening. His viciously amorous propensities induced him to stop ""Topsy,"" a well-known Piute female who happened to be passing along, and the result was that the foolish youth not only got roughly handled by Topsy herself, but her buck, who happened along about that time, jerked an old knife and dug a hole in the back of the boy' neck, and also under his eye. He escaped by lively running, but people generally approve of his bad luck, as a good lesson to the other boys who are big enough to know better. And most people who know Topsy to be a ""son of a gun on wheels"" do not admire the youth's discretion. He got a salutary lesson, which may, perhaps, prove of benefit, even so far as white girls may be concerned.</p><p>Our Austin company of the Nevada National Guard advertised to turn out on public parade Washington's Birthday, but backed out because the expected uniforms for their band did not arrive. Would Washington have failed to turn out with his army to battle for any such reason? People thought it was the company that was to parade, not the band. A plain drum and fife would have answered very well, but the company tacitly said that it was nobody, nothing with a uniformed band.</p><p>The water pipes about town which were frozen have all thawed out or been properly fixed, and all concerned are happy.</p><p>A. A. Flint has torn down a couple of China wash-houses on Main street, and contemplates the erection of an adobe furniture store in their place. This is the only improvement projected in the town at present.</p><p>Many old prospectors are talking glibly about going to Coeur d'Alene or Quijotoa before long, but they won't go. They do not know how to pronounce the name of either locality.</p><p>Is this new moon a dry or a wet one?</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE42.jpg,territorial

Austin people are never happy without plenty of March weather—""wind and cloud and changing skies,"" etc. We read of people in Los Angeles and other effeminate localities gorging themselves on strawberries and all that sort of thing without any feelings of envy. We have plenty of such things—even ripe cherries, green peas and string beans, in cans, yet believe in a season for all things. It is no good eating strawberries the year round; they would become too common to be properly appreciated. Even ice is plenty enough now, but we prefer ice cream and iced punches in the Summer—not in March. Moreover, it is Lent, and all who can are disposed to resist the temptations of appetite, frown upon the great affluence of mortal sin, which smiles and allures us at every turn—wrestle with the devil, as it were, and practically realize what poor, frail, wicked creatures we are. Yet, after all, we feel that it is a comfort to know that</p><p>WORSE PEOPLE</p><p>Live over in Nevada county, California. There, according to the local papers, the conventional footpad, with his cloth or pasteboard mask, infests the public roads, robbing indiscriminately, ranchers, charcoal men, and all who come along, taking even plugs of tobacco or second-hand toothpicks. Miners in any of the little one-horse quartz or drift mines, when payday comes, have no sort of show for getting home with their wages, and road agents are getting so numerous that they frequently waylay and rob each other in order to make business lively and turn an honest penny. Highwaymen used to do a good paying business on the old Comstock Divide until church fairs got too numerous in Gold Hill and Virginia.</p><p>SUDDEN AND NOTABLE DEATH.</p><p>All printers and newspaper men in this section have known Uncle John Booth, but personally they will know him no more, for very suddenly he has laid down his composing-stick and pencil, and gone to join the vast silent majority, out in the mythical beyond. He was the hardest-working newspaper man I ever saw, and his paper always showed good editorial and typographical work. Literally he was the hardest worked man in his own employ, driving himself more incessantly and unrestingly than anybody else. But such work wears heavily, even upon the most rugged constitution, and the final wear out was among the inevitable. For some weeks past he was not able to do half the work that he tried to force upon himself, and he frequently complained of being tired, and unable to get rested. Yet he felt driven to do all he could in his office, and to carefully oversee all the details of his business. Thriftily he made money, and liberally he spent it, for the benefit of his family and himself; yet he had accumulated some little worldly wealth, and looked forward to future enjoyment thereof; latterly, however, moments of depression have clouded his spirits occasionally, and symptoms of breaking down have become more and more apparent. Evening before last, however, he was about town, and his friends all noticed that he seemed to be in an unusually pleasant and genial mood. He went home to his residence before 9 o'clock, and seemed very happy in the society of his family, yet complained sadly of being ""tireder than ever before in his life."" About an hour afterward he went to bed for the night. Half an hour later his wife was suddenly aroused by violent struggles on his part, accompanied by gasping and rattling of the throat. She sprang out and struck a light, and summoned the assistance of their son, Ed., sleeping in the next room. The old man was writhing about, foaming at the mouth, in an evident attack of apoplexy, perfectly speechless, and directly he subsided into a quiet degree of insensibility, only opening his eyes for a moment when L. W. Getchell, his son-in-law, came in and spoke to him, and then closed them forever. Ample surgical aid was summoned, but he was past all human aid. He lay insensible, with his whole body paralyzed all that night and the next day, the only sign of life being his quick, labored breathing, until about 7 o'clock last evening when he quietly subsided into the long, dreamless sleep that knows no earthly waking.</p><p>JOHN BOOTH</p><p>Was born in York, England, March 16, 1818, consequently would have been sixty-six years old on Sunday next. He came to the United States in 1835, went to Cincinnati, Ohio, and shortly afterward to Louisville, Kentucky, and finally to Alton, Illinois. At the age of eighteen he went to Mobile, Alabama, and served a four-years' apprenticeship in a printing office. Subsequently he went to Georgetown, Ohio, where he was employed for some time in the office of the Political Examiner, a Whig paper. February 28, 1840, he married Miss Jane Price, his present widow, in Georgetown, and from 1840 to 1852 was engaged in general merchandizing. In 1853, with his wife and three children, he crossed the plains to California, arriving at Vallecito, Calaveras county, on the 10th of October. He kept a hotel, and had an orchard at or near there for a number of years. In 1874 he was engaged in freighting across the Sierra Nevada, to Virginia City, and subsequently to Ione, in this State. He came to Austin in that same year, and in the year following ran a four-horse coach between here and Ione, carrying passengers, mail and express. He quit the stage business in the latter part of 1865, and went to Virginia City, where he worked for three years as a printer in the Enterprise office. His family joined him there, from Vallecito, and went with him in August, 1868, to Bloomington, Illinois, where he published the Weekly Republican for a year, and then returned to Gold Hill, Nevada, being meantime rejoined by his family. In 1870 he was publisher and proprietor of the Silver State, Unionville, Humboldt county, Nevada; in '71 he ran the Carson Register; in '72 the Pioche Record, and in '73 bought out the interest of John H. Dennis in the Reese River Reveille, with Andrew Casamayou as partner. For three years they also owned the Belmont Courier, Booth personally running that paper. Upon the death of Casamayou in 1877, Mr. Booth traded with the widow of deceased, she taking the Courier and he the Reveille, also trading residences, and thus he removed permanently to Austin, where he has resided with his family ever since, conducting the Reveille with notable success, financially and otherwise. Eleven children were born to himself and wife, five of whom are still living—three sons and two daughters—M. P, Booth, at Tuscarora; W. W. Booth, Belleville; J. E. Booth, Austin; Mrs. Laura Wing, Reno, and Mrs. L. W. Getchell, Austin. J. E. (Ed) Booth, now working in the Reveille office, was recently editor of the Shoshone Rustler, Idaho, on the Oregon Short Line Railroad, fifty miles south of Hailey.</p><p>John Booth was among the most energetic and public-spirited of Austin's citizens. He was a Master Mason, belonging to the Lodge here, and President of the Society of Reese River Pioneers at the time of his death. Conscientious, and of strict integrity in all his business dealings, a kind husband, and most notably a true father and never-failing friend to all his children under all circumstances, he has gone to his just reward, and numerous warm friends will deeply regret his loss. A very varied and busy life has suddenly ended, and John Booth's funeral will take place on Sunday, the sixty-sixth anniversary of his birth.   ALF.

It is poetically recorded that ""St. Patrick was a jintleman, and born av daycint payple,"" which brief biographical sketch is generally accepted as true. This anniversary day will not be publicly celebrated this time in Eastern Nevada, except by balls in the evening at various points, one of which—in Austin—will be given at International Hall, under the auspices of the Irish-American Benevolent Society, in first-class style, as usual. Yesterday looked more like a celebration day, so far as a parade of the military, with martial music, was concerned; but, alas ! it was on the occasion of two funerals. And it happened that they were of two old Reese River pioneers. The first was the</p><p>FUNERAL OF JOHN BOOTH.</p><p>This took pace at 2 o'clock P. M. Our local military company volunteered to do escort duty, with their finely-uniformed band, and they did it in very soldier-like style. They escorted the remains from the family residence to the Episcopal Church, where the religious services to place, after which the funeral procession formed and proceeded down Main street to the cemetery, the band playing a dirge and the military marching with arms reversed. Lander Lodge No.8, of the Masonic fraternity, followed and the society of Reese River Pioneers; then came the hearse, with Masonic pall-bearers, followed by carriages containing members of the family and mourning friends of deceased, succeeded by the longest procession of citizens on foot that has been seen in Austin for many a day, several more carriages bringing up the rear. At the cemetery the burial services were conducted by the Masons according to their peculiarly beautiful and impressive ritual observances on such occasions. The weather had been temporarily sunny and pleasant during the march to the grave, but now, as the burial services were being concluded by the usual march of the Masons around the open grave of their deceased brother, singing as they cast their cypress offerings into it, a ponderous snow-cloud came slowly sweeping across Reese River Valley and along the ghostly snow-sheeted peaks of the Toiyabe range. The broad, heavy flakes came fleecing gently down as a silent tribute from the darkened heavens, covering the coffin with a thick, pure white blanked shroud, and as the large assemblage turned away, leaving the remains of Uncle John Booth reposing quietly in their narrow bed among those of numerous old friends and neighbors he has followed thither in times past, so, too, the snow-storm passed away.</p><p>THE SECOND FUNERAL</p><p>Was that of Ralph Woodward. The services, held at the Catholic Church, were concluded as the procession returned from the cemetery, therefore directly the band came returning down Main street, escorting another long procession. Ralph Woodward was an old man of about the age of John Booth. He was a quiet, unassuming little man, and was elected Public Administrator, on the Democratic ticket, at the last election. He leaves no family or relatives here, and no enemies. For some time past he has been employed as a miner out at Yankee Blade, but his health and strength failing from a severe cold, which culminated in pneumonia, he was brought in from there last Tuesday, and died on Friday. The Society of Reese River Pioneers have dwindled down to a mere handful. A dozen more such drafts upon their ranks as that of yesterday would wipe them all out.</p><p>PIUTE RETRIBUTION.</p><p>The latest and newest howling doctor, or medicine man, in the Piute camp, on the hillside south of town, having recently lost three cases, and been otherwise professionally unfortunate, they were obliged to kill him last Thursday evening. His predecessor was similarly unfortunate, so when they went down among the pine groves of Churchill county last Fall to gather nuts they took him along and killed him. This last doctor could out-howl any I have yet heard, and when he had a case of sickness his wild, unearthly shouts and howlings at the door of the campoody, in his frantic efforts to exorcise or drive away the evil spirit that was afflicting his patient, were as meritorious as they were inefficient. He stood in like a Christian bugler, and when tuned up to concert pitch, and sailing in on his merits, he could be heard all over town. His losing three patients in succession was considered ample and just cause for his judicious removal, although he never had any pay for his professional services, but it was also ascertained that he was a witch, from his having worked on sundry occasions for D. B. Starratt and John Booth, both of whom have died, thus proving him to be a deadly witch, and therefore all the worse for a responsible doctor. The legal patience and forbearance of the tribe was exhausted, consequently they held a council, and decided to kill him. So they deputized and instructed Big Bob to do the job.  Bob visited him with an axe in the evening, while he was asleep, smashed his head, and after stripping the body, to save the clothes, they dragged it over back of the hill, made the job surer with a few rocks, and then threw the corpse into an old prospect hole, where it still remains. One of his numerous ""brothers"" got on the vendetta war-path next day, whetted up his tomahawk and scalping knife, and wanted Big Bob. But B. B. heard of it, and very judiciously vamoosed to some unknown locality where the sagebrush twineth more securely. This matter is not a legal subject for interference on the part of the white people, as it is a case coming under the head of ""tribal relations."" And tribal relations are therefore left to settle these disagreeable little tribulations among themselves.  ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE44.jpg,territorial

April 1, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>A Local Snow Boom—Its Influence—A Legend of Reese River—The Piute Doctor's Grave Filled, but Not His Place—Medical Justice—Political Movements—A Harvest for Austin—Apoplectic Deaths—How the Pilgrim Followed Copy—Farming—Profit and Loss—Dry Moon.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., March 28, 1884.</p><p>Eastern Nevada is enjoying a glorious boom of beautiful snow weather at present, which seems exclusively for the benefit of this particular section, taking in Eureka and contiguous localities, and quite a distance south of here, but not north to Battle Mountain and along the Central Pacific. It commences snowing just at sunset every evening, regularly, and deposits from four to eight inches before morning. Over six inches fell last night. The sun comes out every forenoon and melts off some of it, and in the afternoon it clouds up again for the night's performance. If it would only give some rain, instead of all snow, it would seem some like the famous Winters of '49 and '52 in California, when there were big hail and snow squalls with steady rain between. Now is the Winter of our discontent, in some respects, for ranchers, wood haulers and other outsiders can't come to town conveniently to bring things for sale and spend their money for things they need; consequently, business is dull, and the mill being shut down, does not help matters any in that respect. The mines, however, are working right straight along, and accumulating much rich ore for another prosperous run of the mill.</p><p>REESE RIVER BOOMS.</p><p>It is very rarely that Reese river gets up on its hydraulic ear, floods the valley and goes booming through to a conjunction with the Humboldt. About once in a dozen years, though, it is said to do that. But it has to flood and thoroughly soak the valley first, and have the aqueous material to do it with. George Watt, the veteran rancher and legislative statesman, and Alex. McCafferty, our popular Democratic County Assessor, who takes an interest in water occasionally, both inform me, on their honor as old pioneer settlers, that in the Spring of '74 Reese river ran a good, big stream, booming, rolling and flowing clear through to the Humboldt, for fully two months, every day and regularly. This is corroborated by many other old timers and Piutes, and perhaps this confoundedly stormy March, with its chronic storms and huge piles of snow, may produce a similar boom in this famous river. And they say that trout and sturgeon as long as fence rails come up from Humboldt Lake, which I believe, because Mr. Dadd and John Leutgens say they fished for them, but when they come to remark that whales, crocodiles, unicorns and other nautical monstrosities also came paddling up the mighty Reese, they can tell that to the horse marines and other proverbially credulous persons.</p><p>INTERRED.</p><p>In my last I made mention of our Piute fellow citizens being obliged to kill their latest medicine man by braining him with an axe and some rocks, on account of his having lost three patients in succession, and being also discovered to be a witch. They saved the clothes from the body, and dragged it over to the other side of the hill, where they chucked it into an old prospect hole. There it would have remained exposed till yet, had not some interested friends and relatives of the deceased growled about the matter, and taken upon themselves to go and fill up the hole. By reason of their having to kill their two last medicine men, no other Esculapian or hygienic Piute has felt impelled to generously volunteer his services in the good cause, but some one will, for a heroic ambition for medical honors and distinction inspires them, and they recognize the justice of the fatal contingency. We boast of our civilization, yet see how much the Piutes are in advance of us. Why should the spirit of white mortals be proud? Give it up.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>A meeting of the Lander County Republican Central Committee is to be held here to-morrow evening for the purpose of making arrangements for the requisite primaries for the election of delegates to the State Convention at Virginia City, April 30. That convention will select the delegates from the State to the National Convention at Chicago, June3, which is supposed to nominate the next President of the great American Republic. It is gratifying to know that the Democracy have decided to hold their State Convention June 30, here in Austin. Not that Lander County requires the injection of any fresh backbone material, for there is plenty of it here already, but it will bring welcome railroad, hotel and saloon receipts, which cannot fail to be admiringly appreciated. One hundred drinks apiece for 111 delegates, at two bits a drink, will be no insignificant or unacceptable sum, to say nothing of the army of attendants and interested hangers-on, all of whom will necessarily contribute to Austin's financial aid and comfort. Perhaps, however, it is all for the best, so far as the Republican party is concerned, in that the Democrats may furnish some horrible examples of social and political depravity and demoralization, which may inure to the benefit and advantage of the Republicans and give them the county at the grand election. Anyhow, it will give our local railroad from Battle Mountain a boom, even at half price, and help out future dividends.</p><p>FOLLOWING COPY.</p><p>Is it in the air, or why is it that so many people have recently died very suddenly and unexpectedly, and from apoplectic causes. Only a few weeks ago, D. B. Starratt, one of our leading business men, and a most exemplary citizen in every respect, was thus stricken and in a few short hours was dead. John Booth met with a similar death, and now Alex. McKenzie, so well-known among the mining and social circles of the Comstock and the State, has suddenly stepped out into the mythical realms of the eternal, the lost and the irrecoverable. Speaking of John Booth's death, reminds one of a queer incident in his journalistic career, while running the Carson Register, in 1871, Hazlett, the well-known ""Pilgrim,"" tramp printer, who has for many years traveled from office to office all over the United States, happened along one Friday, and, as usual, the poor, luny little chap was given a job at ""distributing"" type to earn his food. Being short-handed, Uncle John put him at work at a case next morning setting up reprint ""copy."" Knowing his liability to incorrectness, he told the Pilgrim to strictly ""follow copy""—be sure and follow copy at all hazards. It was in the hottest part of the season, but the office being in the second story, with all the windows open, a fine draught of air was circulating through. Suddenly a strong gust of wind whirled in, and away went the piece of copy which Pilgrim was at work on out through a side window. He watched its disappearance, and, remembering his strict orders to ""follow copy,"" made a headlong dash after it out of the window. His tumble was a fearful one, but he did not break his neck, and shortly afterward came limping up the stairs with his rescued copy in hand, looking hilariously triumphant although somewhat dilapidated.</p><p>GENERAL NOTES.</p><p>Farmers beyond the borders of the local snow range, to the northward, are getting in their crops at a lively rate, and as soon as the snow will get out of the way the upper Reese River ranchers will resume work to that effect.</p><p>According to the papers, Governor Adams is reported to have sunk $20,000 in his Nye county mining operations. Who raised what he sunk, or who made what he lost? Some papers publish the item in a hilarious strain, yet Adams most probably sees nothing particularly funny in the proposition. He was reported last year to have made $20,000 in a good cattle speculation.

The two diseases seem to have made an offensive and extremely effectual combination against the peace and welfare of this community, not neglecting any child or young person who has not thereby been afflicted before. Only one or two cases have resulted fatally thus far, but others are now verging upon death. The epidemic apparently commenced with the measles, about six weeks ago, yet one physician declared the presence of scarletina or scarlet fever from the first, and the result indicates that he was right. Ordinarily the measles is regarded as among the necessities and accomplishments of childhood, something no well-constituted youngster should do without. For one to be able to say that he never had the measles, merely indicated that his early training had been sadly neglected, or his preliminary constitutional requirements were not completed, a crime which nothing short of malignant confluent smallpox could expiate. But scarlet fever is much more to be dreaded from its more fatal results and the lasting effects which it is said to entail upon the constitution, sometimes real and sometimes purely imaginary.</p><p>A MUSICAL EPISODE.</p><p>Lieutenant governor Laughton's unexpected visit here, last week was an unexpected visit here last week was an occasion of as much holiday hilarity as if a circus had come to town. Our local brass band turned out and serenaded him on his arrival in the evening, and next morning early they serenaded him again. The band consists of sixteen pieces, and with their handsome new uniform they presented a very creditable appearance. Being attached to Austin's crack military corps, the National Guard, it was appropriate that they should thus do honor to the Adjutant General of the State Militia. And they did not neglect him in the least, but serenaded him some more, every time they thought of it. All day, in the frequent intervals between refreshments they played either from the balcony of the International or their armory, or on the street, or somewhere, and until away late in the night some of them were still unabatedly blasting away. It was in reality a spontaneous impromptu musical ovation, of which Laughton might well be proud. This is now the best band in the State, outside of Virginia City. In the afternoon they succeeded in corralling Laughton in one corner of the armory drew a fiddle on him, and in compliance with unanimous request he favored them with a few choice specimens of his well known artistic skill on that king of all instruments. Jeff. Hall, ex-County Commissioner, and a leading member of the band, was right off from a bed of sickness to which he had been tied for several weeks with a sort of rheumatic fever, and as he sat wearily on a bench, slowly rubbing his rheumatic legs and complaining of his painful weakness, Laughton was tuning up the violin. Then he drew out a few harmonious flourishes, and launched forth on a bright rippling stream of operatic melody which made Jeff fairly squirm in his seat. He swung his ears forward like a Washoe mule and took it all in, and when, with a richly rounded musical peroration, Laughton concluded, Jeff sprang to his feet spry as a bucking goat, slapped him on the shoulder, shook him by the hand, and hilariously declared that no such music had been heard in Austin since Parepa Rosa was here several years ago. It is seldom that one sees a poor, miserable convalescent so suddenly and effectually galvanized into life as was Jeff Hall on this occasion. The band couldn't play without him all the rest of that day, and he has felt better for his harmonious medication, so to speak, ever since. This military company includes among its members a number of excellent marksmen, but they could do no credit to themselves with the old fifty-caliber guns they were provided with. They have not just received a full supply of first-rate forty-five-caliber guns from Lieutenant Governor Laughton since his return to Carson. With these new guns they feel sure they can knock out a chipmunk's eye at 100 yards in less than six weeks' practice.</p><p>MINING OPERATIONS.</p><p>The Manhattan Mill still reposes in status quo, getting ready for another prosperous run, and will start up again about the 1st of next month. Meanwhile Superintendent Curtis has been actively advancing his mining work in all directions, and the result is a goodly accumulation of ore, with plenty more in sight and in prospective, so that when the mill starts again it will not lack for ore to keep it running for a good long time. All the various mining works of the Manhattan Company are in good effective condition, and operating to the best and most economical advantage. Owing to the famous narrowness and eccentric variations of these ore veins, a large amount of prospecting and dead work has necessarily to be done all the time, but the whole is conducted systematically and with excellent judgment, constant watchfulness and engineering skill being brought to bear throughout.</p><p>PUMPING IMPROVEMENT.</p><p>For the first time in the history of this mining district a genuine Cornish plunger pump is being introduced, or, rather, a pair of them. And they are from the old Comstock--two ten-inch pumps, from the Sierra Nevada new works. The pump bob is that of the Woodville works, Lower Gold Hill, and notably strong enough for anything that can be required of it here for several years to come. These pumps are about being placed in the Frost shaft, and will pump from a perpendicular depth of 570 feet. This will correspond with the 800 level of the Lander shaft and the 1800 level of the Paxton incline; in fact, forming a new water level 200 feet below the present general workings, with the best possible facilities for extending as much deeper as may be required in future operations. An immense excavation has been made in the solid rock at the west side of the shaft, for the bob and the pump engine, two new boilers and smokestacks have been placed in position, and under the efficient supervision of John Frost, the well known old chief engineering mechanic of the works of the company for nearly twenty years, or since its first organization, the work is being properly and substantially done. The principal part of the material, even to the pump rods, of Oregon pine timber, ten inches square and sixty feet long, are on the ground, and the huge castings for the pump gearings, etc., are being made at the Fulton foundry, on the Comstock—not that they could not be made here as well, but there is not the requisite iron on hand. When these pumps are placed in full working operation, they will keep all these mines drained with perfect ease, and not work half the time.</p><p>SPECULATIONS.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if the rest of the world is as well favored with snow as Eastern Nevada. It did not snow much last night, but we had a full inch the night before, and snow-squalls prevailed yesterday and last evening. The sky is comparatively clear this morning, but the chances are in favor of more snow before night.</p><p>The farmers of Reese River, Smoky and adjacent valley ranges are hilarious over their prospects for big crops of grain and everything else this season. The Austin baby crop is turning out liberally, but not altogether owing to the weather. It seems to break out periodically, something like the measles.</p><p>Blaine men are plenty enough in this section in the way of ideals for the next Presidency, but there are also numerous warm indorsers of the old chief, Grant, for that highest and most honorable American office, regardless of special prejudices against second, third, fourth or any other particular number of terms. What the Republican party substantially requires is success in that very important and essential matter, and the strongest element or elements should be brought to bear to that end. And let it not be forgotten that the unterrified Democracy have similar ideas on the subject themselves, although in a different and perhaps more effective direction.</p><p>Why is it that a writer for the press cannot possibly write the letter u (you), in a proper name so that the intelligent compositor will not make an n of it? He may form the letter ever so laboriously, underscore it, and all that sort of thing, but it will come out wrong in spite of all precautions. I have come to firmly believe that were the intelligent compositor aforesaid to set up his own obituary, he would obstinately and designedly spell his own name wrong, if it was the last act of his life.</p><p>ALF.

March has generally belied herself in the matter of being considered the stormiest month of the year, and May, the gentlest, floweringest month, has frequently exhibited some very unexpected, as well as uncalled-for and unseasonable weather eccentricities. Of course, all the old-timers tell wonderful stories of hailstorms in July, and we all even remember how Tom Fitch, the silver-tongued, etc., was forcibly interrupted in the midst of one of his best Fourth of July orations, a few years ago in Gold Hill, but the tremendous roar of a fearful hail-storm rattling upon the roof of Homestead Hall, in which the exercises were being held—every hailstone as big as a small potato. But for regular heavy snow-storms, May has always stood in handsomely and done more than her part. Last May we had three inches of snow here on the 1st, three or four more on the 6th and 7th, about four inches on the 15th, three inches more on the 17th, and a heavy hail-storm, by way of variety, on the 3st. But the old-timers here tell of heavy snowfalls sometimes in June. A. S. Learned tells me that about the middle of June, 1872, he was out on a little fishing and hunting excursion with General E. S. Davis, J. A. Wright and two or three others, on the headwaters of the Reese river, when a heavy snow-storm gave them fully eighteen inches of snow to wade through. They were fortunate in finding a lumber camp on one of the forks of the river, and they piled up a lot of timber, forming a very comfortable shelter. They also had a good supply of whisky along, and filled up on hot toddies and punches, and were able to shout hilarious defiance at the unseasonable elements. And they found plenty of fish and game also, and, better than all, came home to Austin with over 900 fine trout, to say nothing of rabbits, quail and other small game.</p><p>THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES</p><p>On the 12th instant passed off very quietly, and three good Blaine delegates were elected to the State convention in your city next Wednesday. Only about three dozen votes were cast, but there was no opposition, and the Presidential preferences indicated on the tickets were nearly unanimous for Blaine. Only one patriot voted in favor of Grant, evidently with the idea that he did not like to see the grand old American chief left entirely out in the cold. Straws are said to show which way the wind blows, and surely this three dozen votes was a mere straw as compared to the real Republican vote of this populous locality. As goes Austin, so goes the nation, of course, consequently Blaine will be hilariously nominated at Chicago on the first ballot. It is pleasing to note the general unanimity and enthusiasm of Blaine's numerous admirers in this section as well as elsewhere, and few of them have any doubt of his nomination, any more than they have of his being qualified for and deserving the Presidency. Yet very few seem to question the real political expediency of his nomination, or to consider the possibility that the Democracy may put up a man whose political record is cleaner and more popular, and whom the solid South, in combination with some millions of Republicans, may elect in preference to Blaine, the plumed warrior from the tall timber of ""away down East."" Blaine is apparently the most popular of Presidential aspirants, but all practical Republican party men will bear in mind that the candidate possessing not only popularity, but the greatest elements of strength, is the man required. In politics, success is everything, and defeat is simply an unpardonable crime. Eastern Nevada, however, seems determined to mount the Blaine hobby with the rest of the country, and ride it regardless of all chances of losing the race.</p><p>HOWLING FOR DEAR LIFE.</p><p>The new medicine man of the Piutes, in their little village on the hillside south of town, is now doing his level best in the way of medicated howling, so to speak, every night, and as often as he can raise his voice during the day, against the evil spirit of disease which is assailing their little community. The fate of the doctor whom they took down in Churchill county last Fall and stoned to death, and his successor, whom they also felt obliged to similarly dispose of a few weeks ago, stares him in the face, and nerves him to more strenuous efforts. He has lost one patient already, and a second is very shaky. Too well he appreciates the chances of retribution upon his devoted head in case of a third being lost, and the poor aboriginal medico hardly eats or sleeps, and is hoarsely howling, literally for dear life. He dares not leave, for he knows they would follow and kill him, and he can only stay and battle with disease and manifest destiny. At one time last night his second patient had a sort of measly cramp or colic for a few minutes, and the way the poor doctor did bounce out of the campoodie and desperately howl was piteous to contemplate.</p><p>MILITARY AND MUSICAL</p><p>As heretofore remarked, we have a well organized military company here in Austin which has just been supplied with a full set of new regulation forty-five-caliber guns by Adjutant General, Lieutenant Governor Laughton. The boys are very proud of their new weapons, and have a grand uniform and target excursion every Sunday. Their greatest ambition is to beat the record of the once famous Sarsfield Guard, of Gold Hill. It is said that Cara's noted brass band, in your city, has fallen into a decline, in which case the National Guard band, here, is the best in the State. Two or three of its members formerly played in Cara's band, and one of them, Fred O'Brien, is unequaled as a performer on the tuba—the big horn that a man gets inside of, as it were, blows around himself a few times and discharges a continuous stream of ponderous notes from the smoke-stack, over the top of his head. Notwithstanding its ungainly appearance it is an essential power in the band, and yields good music under skillful manipulation. It used to belong to Dick Chegwidden of Gold Hill, and during the few years he played it in the brass and string bands of the Comstock he stuffed it full of harmony, which O'Brien finds easy to blow out as occasion requires.</p><p>RUBEOLA.</p><p>The measles, or rubeola, as it is professionally termed, is abating very rapidly. The epidemic disease which has to thoroughly swept through among the juveniles of Austin during the past few weeks resulted fatally in only three instances, although there has been over 200 cases of it. Generally speaking, it seemed to be a cross between Measles and scarlet fever, mild in most cases, but bad in others. Measles should never be called anything but rubeola hereafter, for most people are eternally getting the singular and plural of measles worse mixed than the disease itself.</p><p>STRAY NOTES.</p><p>The snow along the summit of the Toiyabe range has melted off considerably under the benign influence of the nice Spring weather of the last few days, and loads of wood are once more being hauled to town from the ranches of the Smoky Valley slope.</p><p>A prominent grocery man was paralyzed a day or two ago by a man inquiring for canned limburger. He rallied, however, and informed his would-be customer that it had been found to be impossible to confine limburger in cans, but when hot weather came, by-and-by, if he could find a swelled can of rotten oysters he would save it for him.</p><p>It rained and snowed finely here yesterday. The backbone of Winter seems to be again fractured, but the weather is still anything but settled. As Blauvelt, of Gold Hill, used to so originally and felicitously remark, ""Winter still lingers in the lap of Spring.""</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE47.jpg,territorial
TE48,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday. . . . . . . . . . May 11, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Spring Sproutings—Pastoral Notes—The Domestic Ranchers and Horace Greeleys of Austin—Unfortunate Trees—Manhattan Mill Matters and Personalities—Another Prosperous Run Inaugurated—Mining Operations and Rich Ruby Silver Ore—Enterprising Miners—The Big Pump—West Point and Miscellaneous Points.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., May 9, 1884.</p><p>The present moon commenced wet enough, but has dried out finely since. We have had three days, now, without any snow or hail squalls, encouraging us to presume that the mythical backbone of Winter has been broken for the last time, so far as the present Spring is concerned. Nobody weeps to see the genial sunshine, and especially bare ground once more, and the grateful sagebrush, resurrected from its frosty winding sheet, is sprouting and greening forth in spicy fragrance upon the breezes of Spring. Babbling brooks are somewhat scarce about here, and so are babbling birds, except turkeys, hens, ducks and other domestic fowls, but the chances are not good that the numerous locusts and poplars which embellish Austin homes will be all leaved out and verdant by the 10th of next month, when the Democratic State Convention meets here.</p><p>AGRICULTURAL.</p><p>Throughout the Reese River section, as well as the rest of Eastern Nevada, the farmers  have been, and still are, very busy putting in their crops, and more hay, grain and potatoes will be raised this season than for several years past. This refers to the valleys and creek bottom lands, but let it be also known and appreciated that the home domestic ranchers are not idle. They are at work, and the chances are that there will be more spading up of door yards and back yards for agricultural and floricultural purposes than for several years past. And about now it is that the locust trees are receiving their regular annual trimming. For some unaccountable reason, it has become a general, unmitigated observance throughout Austin to keep the locust trees, particularly, well headed down, and therefore it is that this variety of tree looks scrubby and subdued. In fact, the habit has become so chronic that in many instances, where the old tree trimmers have methodically disregarded last year's growth, the trees grow shorter and shorter, and consist of merely dwarfed trunks and discouraged, stubby limbs, with no hope of heavily extensive foliage. Owing to this arbitrary trimming observance, all the trees in town put together would not furnish half enough shade for an old-time Comstock picnic. Not so, however, with ""garden sass."" Everybody with a door-yard which will justify it buys vegetable seeds by the quantity and sows the same liberally, regardless of expense or limited territory. The Austin domestic rancher allows that he who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, does tolerably well, but if he can make seventeen beets grow where there is only room for one, he knocks spots out of the two-bladed grass man. Our genial County Assessor, Alex. McCafferty, who has got married and settled down, is deeply absorbed in Horace Greeley's famous book on farming, and out of the seven loads of good dirt he has had hauled into his door-yard he expects to realize seven loads of cabbages, to say nothing of his beds of hominy, pearl barley, sage and other farinaceous shrubs, of which he is very fond. He is very liable to find that in agriculture it is sometimes easier to assess than to collect.</p><p>THE MILL REVIVAL.</p><p>The Manhattan mill started up again last Monday for a long and prosperous run after a judicious rest since February 20, principally for much needed repairs and renovation from its previous run of sixteen months. The whole concern received a thorough overhauling, and sundry advantageous improvements have been introduced. Meanwhile some of the well known old employees were given a welcome chance for rest and recuperation. Charley Durning, the long time Superintendent, put on a boiled shirt and store clothes and took a cruise down to San Francisco and other sections of the golden land of sunshine and flowers. James Sullivan, the manager of the Stedefeldt furnace connected with the mill, laid off on his laurels and fixed himself up for another run of five years, if required. But Jimmy Robinson, the ore receiver, weigher and sampler, took a wider range. He went to the Sandwich Islands. There he gorged himself with bananas and yams, hobnobbed with King Kalakaua, admired Daggett, roamed among the orange groves and taro patches and was happy. And the trip to and fro across the blue Pacific was glorious. The salt sea breeze thoroughly chlorinated the rich ore dust which has so completely filled and saturated his system during his sixteen years' run in the mill, and he came home to resume his old post as efficiently as ever, for another sixteen years. The other old hands are in place, and the mill, machine shop, foundry and other concomitant arrangements all fall in to work together harmoniously and prosperously.</p><p>MINING MATTERS.</p><p>While the mill was resting and recuperating, the mines were not at all idle, by any means. The regular ore resources were actively developed, and new work pushed ahead at all eligible points, new stopes opened up and plenty of ore accumulated, assuring an indefinitely long run of the mill. Some very rich ore has been taken from the lander shaft of late, and the munificent yield still continues. Some specimens of the beautiful ruby silver, a foot thick and worth $3,000 or $4,000 a ton, from the Lander, were brought to the office of the company, near the mill, a day or two since, and are on exhibition. If that little vein was only a few hundred feet wider, it would very perceptibly decrease the price of silver in the financial markets of the world. But that's the grand trouble here; these exceedingly rich veins are limited to a very few inches in width, and although very reliable in the matter of continuity, vary exceedingly in the matter of size and situation. A five or six-inch bonanza is liable to break off suddenly at any time, yet the old-experienced miner knows very well that he has only to drive east, beyond the break, to find the continuation. But he may have to drift far enough to break him before he gets through. Nevertheless, the numerous chloriders, tributers or leasers, like old California gold-diggers, prefer to take their chances, instead of hiring out for ""day's pay,"" and some of them make nice little piles by so doing, while others, of course, merely subsist along, year after year, and with the assistance of the company.</p><p>THE PUMP.</p><p>The big Cornish plunger pump being put in at the Frost shaft is one of the most important improvements in that line yet adopted in these mines, and will most assuredly prove to be so. As mentioned in a former letter it is a ponderous, double affair, from the Comstock. The large excavation for the powerful pump-bog is slowly but substantially being filled with the requisite masonry for the anchor bolts, etc., and some of the big bed timbers are in place. Another month will make a well advanced showing. Each department of the work is in very competent charge, and when done, all will be well done.</p><p>WEST POINT.</p><p>The West Point cadetship would seem to be a hard point for the Commissioners at Winnemucca to decide. Yet should they decide in favor of our Austin boy, Robbie Eames, who was not behind any, at last accounts, nobody here would object. It will have to be an exceedingly smart and meritorious lad that will beat young Eames. And the young man that succeeds not only here, but at West Point, will simply be made for life. What grander prestige could a truly American youth desire than simply this one cardinal point of success?—West Point.</p><p>SUNDRY POINTS.</p><p>Wiggins' weather predictions never fail. They are sure to come true somewhere or somewhere else. And so, too, with the Washoe Bowers Seeress. She predicted that Reno would be destroyed by fire in the latter part of April or the first of May. But it was Wadsworth that was destroyed instead. She wasn't forty miles out of the way, which is more than Wiggins can brag of generally. The insinuation that our Washoe Seeress was subsidized by the insurance companies in this matter is both mean and unjustifiable.</p><p>It is politically pleasant to hear that the Republican delegates to Chicago go unpledged, although not uninstructed. They are good, square, sensible men without exception, and in the case of Blaine is not nominated on the first ballot, and a dark horse is required, he might be found in Austin. But modesty forbids any suggestions on my part.</p><p>Cassidy's speech in Congress on April 1, relative to the retirement and recoinage of the trade dollar, and the silver question generally, was one of his best efforts, and very creditable to a representative from Eastern Nevada and the Pacific Coast. It had a decidedly Jonesy ring to it, and, by-the-by, Jones himself is liable to express himself on this exceedingly interesting subject before long.</p><p>Local politics in this section do not boil just yet, but will in due time, when I will try and give you the true inwardness of the matter and the various points of interest at stake.</p><p>The World's International and Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans will be most worthily represented by Colonel C. C. Thomas, whom we all so long and favorable know, in behalf of our young and ambitious State. It has been suggested that he should commence calling in Nevada mineral contributions at an early date. The richest and most beautiful specimen of silver ore from this State at the Denver Exposition was from Austin, and Austin is prepared to send something even finer and better to New Orleans.     ALF.

April 30, 1884</p><p>A LOST BUT TOUGH LITTLE BOY</p><p>Out All Night in a Violent Snow Storm, and Found Next Day Under a Sagebush, Chewing Gum.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., April 27, 1884.</p><p>Saturday afternoon being tolerably pleasant, the family of Richard Husband, living in the upper part of Austin, together with a few friends, went over to Marshall Canyon, a mile or so south of town, on a sort of picnic excursion. Little Dicky Husband, about seven years of age, with some of the other children of the party, after a while strayed around the hillsides and ravines in search of wild flowers, and somehow he got separated from the rest and they came in without him. Search was immediately made, but he could not be found. There being indications of stormy weather, the women and children returned to town, and, the alarm being given, quite a strong party of men started out to assist in the search for the missing lad.</p><p>ON TRACK.</p><p>They met an Indian, who told them, in response to their eager inquiries, that he had seen a little white boy running along a hillside away to the southward, crying, and when he went toward him the little fellow was frightened and ran faster, screaming with terror. Snow was then falling, and although they found his track and followed for a mile or so, they soon list it in the gathering darkness and increasing snow. They followed on in the same direction among the foothills of the Toiyabe range, and all night, in one of the heaviest snow storms of the season, they wandered over the rocky slopes and through steep ravines, with no success whatever. When daylight came the snow was several inches in depth, and</p><p>THE STORM STILL RAGING.</p><p>Scattering themselves over the country in all likely directions the eager searchers pressed onward, hoping to find the little wanderer still alive. Meanwhile, other parties from town, on foot and on horseback, also started out to assist in the search, for by this time the alarm was general. The mother of the little boy was nearly distracted, and could hardly be restrained from also going forth out into the wild storm and deep snow to look for her darling.</p><p>RESCUED AND ALIVE.</p><p>About 9 o'clock this forenoon a portion of the first searching party suddenly saw what they were after. The little fellow stood by a large sagebrush on the hillside not far distant, but when he saw them he dodged down out of sight. Hurrying thither they found him crouching down on the ground beneath the sheltering bush, with both hands in his pockets, and apparently all right, except somewhat cold and uneasy, but on recognizing some of them he expressed his gladness to be found. He said when he strayed out of sight of the other children the evening before, and thought he was lost, he ran as hard as he could along the first path he could see and did not stop till he got to where they found him, and crawled under the sagebrush, out of the snow, completely exhausted. One of the men noticing that he was chewing something, said: ""What are you eating sagebrush for, bub? Are you hungry?"" ""No,"" stoutly replied little Dicky, ""I ain't a eating sagebrush,""</p><p>I'M A CHEWIN' MY GUM,</p><p>And I ain't hungry, neither."" The lost little boy was carried triumphantly homeward, and is apparently not injured at all, except that he is pretty well tired out, and his little feet are sore. The place where he was found is within a mile and a half of Big Creek, over ten miles from Austin, therefore this youngster may be considered a tough, hardy specimen and not easily killed.</p><p>OTHER ITEMS.</p><p>A damp, heavy snowstorm prevailed last night and all day to-day, and this evening it bids fair to continue for another twenty-four hours. The sleighing is splendid, but nobody cares to enjoy it. Indeed the beautiful snow has become boringly wearisome.</p><p>As stated in my letter of the 11th instant, the Manhattan mill will start up for another long and prosperous run on the 1st of May. In fact the furnace will be lighted to-morrow, but it takes three or four days to get that huge old Stedefeldt furnace arrangement properly heated up for regular work.</p><p>ALF.

TE50,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Tuesday. . . . . . . . . . May 27, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Thundering Humidity—A Surplus of Rain—An Austin Alarm—Hopeful Chances—Political Whisky—No Proxies Wanted in the Coming Democratic State Convention—The Next President—Local Politics—An Old Forty-Niner Passes By—Some Well-Known Visitors—Festival Doings—Floatings—Dollars.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., May 23, 1884.</p><p>The rattle and the roar of heaven's artillery has considerably commingled with the busy racket of the hammer and the saw during the last two or three days, especially in the afternoon, and quite a perceptible flavor of excitement has disturbed the chronic equanimity of Austin's population. Heavy thunder storms have prevailed every afternoon for a week, but Tuesday afternoon a small waterlogged cloud dumped its contents against the summit sagebrush sources of this canyon, and pretty soon torrents of dirty water came rolling down. The Manhattan mill whistle tooted the alarm, and everybody knew what it meant. Miners got out in a hurry, and there was a rush from all quarters to see the flood come down. But, bah ! it wasn't much of a flood after all. Nothing to be compared to the famous cloudburst floods of August, 1874, which swept away the Postoffice and other buildings, and again in August, 1878, when the Reveille office was washed down stream, and both sides of Main street generally wrecked. This time two or three pretty good-sized streams of water sloshed drunkenly down the street, doing no material damage, but considerably interesting the crowds of Piutes—bucks, squaws and papooses—who lined the sidewalks beneath the protecting awnings. The main sewer of Gold Hill would easily carry twice as much of a flood. But that is about three times as big as Austin's Main-street sewer, with five times steeper descent. And the old Reese River Pioneer shook his head ominously, and hopefully said to Johnny-Come-Lately, with a tinge of disappointment, ""Oh, no; this ain't nothin'. Jest you wait till August, the proper time for 'em, and we'll show you a cloudburst that'll make yer eyes bug out. Don't smile, sonny; we'll show you the true racket yet.""</p><p>PREPARATORY.</p><p>Most of the hammering and sawing before mentioned was in putting up barricades against the anticipated flood. All along both sides of Main street everybody have their floodgates ready to slip in across their doorways, three or four feet high above the thresholds, and planks always at hand to nail across any other vulnerable point. Yet all this hammering and sawing is not on account of floods of water, but some of it is preparatory to furnishing floods of whisky for the thirsty Democratic throats which will constitute a part of the Democratic State Convention to meet here on the 10th of next month. Sundry new saloons are being opened and fitted up in good style for the reception and entertainment of those delegates, and carpenters, painters and whitewashers find busy employment. But it is desired to be particularly understood that all delegates elected should by all means come, and not be mean enough to send proxies. Proxies don't drink; proxies don't roll the festive billiard ball; proxies don't run faro or even restaurants; there's no nutriment in proxies. One Matt. Canavan is worth three dozen proxies. If the Democratic party expects to achieve any success in Austin through this convention, every delegate must come in person, and with money, but no proxies in his pocket.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>The chances are that before my next regular letter the Chicago Convention will decide who is to be the next President of these United States. Blaine's chances are too good for success, and Arthur's chances are not good enough. Grant's recent misfortune in stocks, and the resultant announcement of a desire on the part of personally admiring friends to make up another purse to put him on his feet again, does not meet with general admiration, as looking too much like making him a sort of popular mendicant. And the old Chief himself would doubtless rather be left out of the contest, yet should he be nominated he will be elected, even though, perhaps, Austin should go against him. Will the sable caballo be Edmunds, Washburne or Ben. Butler? We shall soon know. Ah ! but should Blaine be nominated just think of how that book of his will be criticized and politically banged over his unfortunate head. ""Would that mine enemy would write a book,"" would come smilingly into the minds and voices of his opponents, and they would hilariously remark: ""Here we have him."" So, even if Blaine gets beaten in the nomination, his book will be finely advertised and make him rich.</p><p>LOCAL POLITICS.</p><p>Of course, is a matter of not pronounced excitement at present, but all sorts of rumors are floating in the air, as for instance, to the effect that Mr. Wren, of Eureka, wants to be United States Senator in place of J. P. Jones, and that M. D. Foley, of Eureka, would like Cassidy's place in Congress; also, that Fred. Hart, the well-known and popular young journalist, is coming over from San Francisco shortly to run the Eureka Leader, which they own, in their political interest. Political aspirations, locally nearer to where I am now writing, will be subject to future notice and critical consideration, on both sides of the political proposition, in due time.</p><p>ONE OF THEM.</p><p>A genuine old Forty-niner passed down Main street day before yesterday. Most people who saw him merely considered him a queer-looking old duck, but there were many, like myself, who fraternally smiled as we recognized one of the typical old boys. The old California gold miner was unmistakably written all over him. He was a short, square-built old youngster, with full grizzled hair and beard that had seen no other trimming than his old shears or knife could do since he came into the land of gold in the days of old, and his dilapidated brown felt hat had a peculiar jaunty old mash over the larboard side of his head that only belongs to and is accomplished successfully by his kind. One trousers' leg was in his boot, and the other wasn't, and no overcoat obscured the old gray flannel shirt he wore. His trusty old double-barreled shotgun—sudden death to thousands of quail, jackass rabbits, deer, etc.---was slung under his left arm by a bit of baling rope across his right shoulder, and an old briar-root pipe was in his mouth. He led a quiet-looking sorrel horse, well packed with a canvas tent, cooking utensils, pick, shovel and other practical utensils, and the independent, dam-yer-eyes swing of that blessed old-time gold digger was refreshing to contemplate. He cast a sort of practical glance at the street and buildings as he went along, same as he has in passing through hundreds of towns, many of which have died in the long ago, but he was not worrying his old noddle very much as to his night's lodging. He looked straight down the grade toward Reese river, and thought only of a place to picket out his horse in good feed, and where he could set up his little old hotel and camp for a day or two. He had got out of California by way of Bodie; had cruised around through the eastern part of the State, almost to the Utah line, seen and prospected the reputed rich gold mines of Osceola, and was now pointing his weather-beaten old pioneer nose straight toward the Golden west—to God's country—the genial land of sunshine and flowers, the grape and the fig, where he can always live easily and comfortably amid glorious surroundings, pleasant reminiscences, and die happy. Pass along, old boy, may your old briar-root pipe always smoke freely amid peace and contentment.</p><p>PERSONAL.</p><p>William Hardy, well-known as a thoroughly experienced mining and millman for numerous years on the Comstock, was here a few days ago, and took a good look at the mining and milling situation generally, and very practically, as he might be expected to do. He found considerable rich ore in the mining depths, and proved the method of ore reduction; in short he left with a good impression of Austin and its bullion resources.</p><p>Bishop Whitaker arrived night before last, and has renewed acquaintance with many old personal friends. He attended the strawberry festival given by the ladies of the M. E. Church last evening, and will go to Belmont to-morrow, to return next Monday and stay a few days in Austin. The festival  last evening was a grand success in every respect, financially and all other ways, the hall being crowded and everybody enjoying it. Strawberries two-bits a box.</p><p>FLOATINGS.</p><p>The Piute bucks here in Austin always carefully protect their hats against the heavy rain showers, by tying barley sacks over and around them, but their linen dusters have to take it.</p><p>The numerous big failures in the East are simply terrific, but it is remarkable that most of them promise to pay about ninety cents on the dollar-equally remarkable that they don't do it.</p><p>The item going the round of the papers about how our big millionaires made their first dollar is well enough as far as it goes. But how about the spending of their last dollar? Ask Jim Keene, and, a few years hence, ask some of the rest. Yet the item speaks of none that got their first dollar before they were ten years old. Bah ! how slow. Hundreds of smart boys have gobbled their first dollar, got into jail for it and built railroads afterward. No one can safely bet on the outcroppings or outcomings of fortune.    ALF.

June 11, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Grand Odd Fellows' Visit to Austin—Some Sweet Singing-Sagebrush Hospitality—Reese River Extension Railroad Troubles—Devilish Ham—Uncle George Tufly—Five Thousand Dollar Rock—Educational—Hurrah! For Blaine—Torchlight Procession and General Rejoicing—Stray Notes and Observations—The Coming Saloon Bonanza—Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., June 6, 1884.</p><p>The weather throughout this section has been principally rainy for the past few weeks, but one of the principal sensations of the last few days has been the Annual Convention or meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Odd Fellows of this State. The parade on Thursday of the Grand Lodge, escorted by the Encampment and Austin Lodge, No. 9, preceded by our local band in full uniform, was very fine, and the exercises at the Methodist Church peculiarly interesting. Some neat and felicitating speeches were made by H. T. Creswell, Grand Master W. J. Smith, D. O. Adkison, George H. Morrison and A. D. Rock, and the singing by the choir was the best I have ever heard on such an occasion.</p><p>AUSTIN'S SWEET SINGER,</p><p>Mrs. Prisk, fairly exceeded all her former efforts. She is endowed with a clear, rich soprano voice, of remarkable purity and power, and her solos were given with bird-like sweetness and effect. It will be borne in mind that Miss Wixom, the ""Emma Nevada"" now achieving such magnificent success in the operatic circles of Europe, grew up from childhood here in Austin, developed her wonderful powers as a singer, and from here went forth to her triumphant career in the musical world. By many, Mrs. Prisk is considered to possess nearly or quite as fine a voice, in some respects, only requiring proper cultivation and opportunity to give it full effect.</p><p>ROYALLY ENTERTAINED.</p><p>The fraternity of Austin did their level best to entertain their brethren from the rest of the State, and succeeded most admirably. They gave them the best of everything to eat and drink, showed them everything of interest and tried hard to get up an old time cloudburst, being perfectly willing to have half of the town washed away if it would conduce to the sensational entertainment and novel pleasure of their guests; and this morning a couple of flat cars, fitted up with seats, took them down the steep railroad grade from town to the depot at Clifton, from whence they took their departure on the regular train for their respective homes at 2 o'clock A. M. A large assemblage of their brother Odd fellows, friends and townspeople cheered lustily as they left town, and they cheered lustily in response. Our people feel very grateful for this fraternal visit, and would be happy to have it repeated every years.</p><p>TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS.</p><p>Owing to the copious rains and melting snows Reese river has, within the past two weeks, succeeded in running through to a connection with the Humboldt at or near Battle Mountain, something it has not achieved since the spring of 1874, ten years ago, when it thus wildly flowed for two months. And, as I have before stated, according to the statement of Mr. Dadd, George Watt, Alex. McCafferty, John Leutjens and other veracious Austin pioneers, trout and sturgeon, as big as saw logs, came up the river from Humboldt Lake. But now the rise in this famous river comes as a special and unwelcome calamity, for it has washed away the railroad in one place, about half way between here and Battle Mountain, and threatens other points. In fact, it has interrupted mail and passenger communication to a limited extend, and but for the most active exertions on the part of the railroad company, the interruption would be really disastrous.</p><p>Last Monday night, when the Odd Fellows were coming up, they were detained at the washout five hours before the track could be fixed, so as to allow them to pass over and onward. It was very rough on the brethren to be thus cast away, as it were, a long distance from home or any reliable source of supply in the shape of food or drink, and there was, consequently, a considerable amount of skirmishing after anything to be found in the shape of eatables or beverages. Somebody found a nice basket of lunch, which George Stewart had lain in, and confiscated the contents for the benefit of the crowd without waiting for George to do so. There were lots of deviled ham sandwiches in the outfit, and they were not slow in being placed where they would do the most good. Uncle George Tufly got a bite, but here's what he says of it: ""Oh, Dot Pilly Rogers, der gay poy from Elko, he gifs me der pread fon der sandwiches, und eats all der devilish ham himself.""</p><p>AN INVERTED RIVER.</p><p>Uncle George rather likes Austin and the people generally, for he has crowds of friends here. Sayd he: ""Ph shingo! Der sageprush looks pully, unt der hills is shust so green as Carson, but vot a tang queer river is dot Reese. Vay down to Paddlemountain it's no pigger as a Tutch prewer could dhring; but it kits pigger as you kits up to it, vhere it ought ter git schmaller, unt blays hell mit der railrote. Der tam schtream was pilt der wrong end up hill. Dots vots der matter.""</p><p>RUBY SILVER.</p><p>But Uncle George goes home happy in the possession of one of the richest and prettiest specimens of ruby silver ore to be found in these mines, presented to him by the Manhattan folks. It weighs about three pounds, and will assay over $5,000 to the ton. Fifty American dollars couldn't buy it now, and Uncle George exultantly shows it to his envious contemporaries, telling them how much better he is appreciated than they, and how a man of 300 pounds responsibility and true moral goodness will always be favored before any ordinary human shrimp.</p><p>OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</p><p>By special invitation I visited the public schools in this town the other day. The school building is principally of brick eligibly situated in the upper part of town, and consists of four departments—high school, first and second grammar and primary—employing four teachers. The average daily attendance is about 200. The high school, conducted by Professor S. D. Bristow, Principal, has an average attendance of about thirty-two scholars and among the higher branches taught are algebra, geometry, rhetoric, chemistry, physiology, etc. There are some very bright youths in this department, and their achievements on the blackboard, in both figures and writing, were very creditable, and their ready and generally correct replies showed evidence of very careful and judicious training. The first grammar department, conducted by Professor J. B. Cowden, has forty-eight scholars, and a very good degree of advancement is noticeable in the various students. In the second grammar department, Miss Kate T. Gallagher, teacher, there are sixty-nine scholars, and in the primary department, Miss Fannie J. Work, teacher, fifty scholars. The scholars are ably managed, and creditable advancement is the result. The rooms are well lighted and ventilated throughout the building, but certain improvements in construction could be advantageously made. No such degree of interest or effort in the management or conduct of the scholars is manifested here as is seen in the Reno, Comstock or Carson schools, parents, guardians or even the Trustees rarely visiting the schools. This is complimentary, as showing the implicit degree of confidence reposed in the teachers, all of whom are talented and well qualified for their respective positions. As for the scholars, they are generally smart and intelligent, about as much so as those of other parts of the State. To say they are not would be a reflection upon their parents and their home management</p><p>HURRAH ! FOR BLAINE.</p><p>The nomination of Blaine this day was the occasion of a high degree of excitement in Austin, as no doubt it was to a greater or less extent in other parts of the nation. An eager crowd gathered in front of the telegraph office, reading the result of the various ballots posted in the window as fast as received, and when the final announcement of Blaine's success came, the glad news spread like wildfire, and directly the steam whistles gave a startling salute. Up went flags, and down went the beer into many a rejoicing throat, and scores of hilarious revelers were soon shouting and hurrahing for Blaine. At dark the brass band, in full uniform, marched with numerous citizens up to the Manhattan mill, where a train of six flat cars was fitted up,, and as the shades of evening gathered the train slowly moved down the track through town and up again, the ""Mules Relief"" locomotive being attached. Four large iron baskets of fire blazed from posts on the cars, and the crowd of citizens on board bore lighted torches and waved the old Stars and Stripes, as the band played ""Hail, Columbia!"" and other patriotic American airs. And mounted on the end car was a lively little cannon, which belched forth small thunder at frequent intervals as the train moved along. It was a brilliant and novel sight, and a sort of wake to the dead hopes of the Democracy. Now let them trot out their old Presidential corpse, Sammy Tilden, and we'll bury him so deep that the sound of the resurrection trumpet will never reach him. After passing down and up street this torchlight procession on wheels dissolved and dispersed, but much jollification was kept up the rest of the night.</p><p>STRAY NOTES.</p><p>The old pioneer says no white man ever saw Reese river so boomingly high before. It really is quite a sizeable river in this vicinity, but gets much absorbed and attenuated before reaching the Humboldt. It is of the catfish or sculpin style, more head than tail.</p><p>I know most of the delegate members to the Grand Lodge personally, and all seemed to have grown older in the last two or three years except D. O. Adkison. He looked about as old fifteen years ago, on the Comstock, as he does now. Like a Chinaman's donkey, after reaching a certain degree of age, he can get no older.</p><p>The other day, on the street, Uncle George Tufly offered to pick up any man in the crowd and carry him up stairs, and then wanted to get a bet of $100 that no two men in the crowd could carry him up stairs.</p><p>The next sensation in this mad whirl of public excitement will be the Democratic State Convention here on the 10th—next Tuesday. The recent Democratic primaries in Austin elected delegates not favorable to Cassidy for Congress. So Matt. Canavan will find himself perfectly at home here, if he feels Congressionally inclined. The saloons are all doing a fine business now, and look forward to the coming convention as a big bonanza.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE51.jpg,territorial
TE52,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Saturday. . . . . . . . . . June 14, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Democratic State Convention—Too Short, Sweet and Unprofitable—Uncle James Gets Set Down Upon—A Friendly Crime—Auriferous Veal Barbecue—Local Sagebrush Minstrelsy—The Beautiful Rain.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., June 12, 1884.</p><p>The Democratic State Convention, like a political cloudburst, as it were, has visited Austin, passed away, and the staunch old town comes out bright and smiling from the portentous episode. The visitation was short and sweet, and unanimously enjoyed while it lasted. The popular objections to it were its brevity, unanimity, numerous proxies and its consequent degree of unprofitableness. Only fifty-seven out of 111 delegates coming to a political convention—in an expectant town—is a grievous wrong. True, the delegates spent considerable money, yet they did not show any very remarkable degree of Democratic recklessness in that desirable respect, although the boys stood up to the bar manfully with them whenever they slung out any inducements. Of course there was much financial nutriment in it, but had it lasted three days instead of one, it would have been three times as profitable. There is getting to be too much Republican unanimity in these Democratic Conventions—also too many proxies. It hardly pays to fit up new saloons for the occasion.</p><p>THE CONVENTION</p><p>Ran through all its business on Tuesday evening, and the delegates departed by railroad or private carriage before next morning. It was like a circus in some respects, having its ring-master and its clown. And it was also some like a Congress. Its ""Websterian"" representative or prototype was the ponderously eloquent Cresswell; its Clay, John H. Dennis; its Calhoun, Sadler, of Eureka; its Douglas, Canavan, of Storey, and its ""fiery Rupert of Debate,"" Hagerman, of Reno. Colonel Jerry Moore looked out of place, and reminded one of the old story about the little story who accidentally got among a lot of crows, and his fate will be similar. Colonel Hardesty, of Elko, carried his head nearly a foot higher than any of them, and had the least to say. He is just half an inch taller than Dunphy, the other great cattle man of this section. How is it that most of the great cattle kings or bovine rulers of the sagebrush, whose domains and cattle and sheep cover thousands of hills and numerous valleys, monopolize more of the public lands than anybody, are Democrats? The platform and resolutions of this convention have been published for the public edification.  As Colonel Ellis, of Carson, read one plank after the other, each prominent [… line missing] applauded, even to that peculiarly significant one opposing any division of the public school funds or sectarian purposes. The regular biennial Democratic arrangement of the Republican party, the nomination of Cassidy for Congress, and Sewell for Justice of the Supreme Court, by acclamation, and everything else passed off harmoniously till it came to nominations for the six delegates to the National Convention at Chicago. Then came</p><p>THE ONLY WRANGLE.</p><p>Senator Fair was placed in nomination as a delegate. Captain Matt. Canavan had already been given a special acclamatory nomination, and it was proposed to compliment Senator Fair the same way. Somebody filed a demurrer, others demurred and argued, and the hitch became a remarkably vigorous wrangle. One delegate got in a remark about worshiping the golden calf, meaning Fair, and another delegate ambitiously, yet inconsistently, claimed himself to be the auriferous juvenile ovine referred to. Explanations, appeals from decisions of the chair, points of order, and all sorts of parliamentary rackets were tumbled up, and the wrangle rolled forward into wearisome monotony. The Chairman, G. W. Baker, of Eureka, proved himself a trump, and all hi rulings were sustained. Fair's real friends insisted that this being a Tilden and Hendricks Convention, his name should be withdrawn, he having in times past expressed his opinion that Tilden was not capable or suitable man for President. The Storey county delegation unanimously opposed Fair's nomination for this reason, and as a matter of justice to him, considering that he would himself object to being pledged or in any way bound with the other delegates to the support of a man he would not have for President. This useless and exceedingly detrimental wrangle was finally brought to a close by a ballot, in which Fair was left away out in the cold, and with nobody to thank for his being thus injudiciously slaughtered in the house of his friends.</p><p>LOCAL TALENT.</p><p>The first regular entertainment of the Savannah Minstrels was given at International Hall evening before last, and was well attended. The company consists of about a dozen Austin youngsters, including three young misses, two of whom are very small in stature, but are really possessed of no small degree of musical and artistic ability. They appeared in songs and character acts very creditably, and all hands did very well in their burnt-cork variety performance. Master Willie Howard, the leading minstrel, is a genuine colored youth of about fifteen, born and raised in Austin, and in song, dance and general acting exhibits a remarkable degree of talent, and a natural adaptability for that line of business.</p><p>WEATHER.</p><p>Much rain fell yesterday; in fact, the clerk of the weather gives us each day our daily rain, and the sagebrush never looked greener or more flourishing.</p><p>ALF.

Butler.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., June 21, 1884.</p><p>The Long continued and copiously rainy season had the effect to finally flood Reese River Valley fearfully and wash away an extensive section of the railroad, cutting off our mail, passenger and freight facilities for several days. In fact had it not been for the telegraph we would have been totally cut off from all communication with the outside world. During the last four or five days some real stern hot Summer weather has set in, accompanied by a sudden drought, there being no rain for two days, and causing the river to drop on itself so that the railroad could be mended and trains run over it again. Day before yesterday about a dozen cars got through from Battle Mountain with freight, the first for about two weeks. This sudden drought and hot weather created a very lively demand for beer and other cooling irrigants. The amount of such beverage required to keep the old Reese River pioneer's clay properly moistened is astonishing. Yesterday and day before we had some light thunder showers in the afternoon, and this afternoon a cloudburst is confidently anticipated.</p><p>DEMORALIZED</p><p>The entire Democracy of Austin, from Coffee to Creseenzo are bowed down in the sackcloth and ashes of disgust and demoralization, since the absolute refusal of old Sammy Tilden to be nominated and elected President. They staked their whole political pile on him at their recent State Convention here, enthusiastically swearing eternal fealty to him dead or alive. They declared that he was swindled out of his election eight years ago by an eight to seven fraud, and that he must now be vindicated by a grand unanimous re-election. The Democracy apologize for their neglect to thus vindicate him four years ago on the ground that he refused to have it. He did not really believe he was fairly elected four years ago, neither did they. Then affecting to believe so now is merely a measure of popular Democratic enthusiasm through which they hoped to win. ""Whom the gods would destroy they first made mad,"" and our Democratic friends in this convention did so many mad things and made such mad blunders, that they have been mad ever since and willing to be destroyed. The worst blunder was the snubbing of Senator Fair. When he was placed in nomination as delegate to the National Convention at Chicago, a friend arose and expressed an earnest hope that this convention would not make the same blunder that the Republicans had in similarly rejecting two of their best men, Mackay and Jones, by refusing to send them to Chicago. But they deliberately and cold-bloodedly did snub our Uncle Jeems, on the ground that he was not a Tilden man, and now that Tilden has declined they are madder than ever to know that they slaughtered Fair, and destroyed all future chances at his plethoric sack, all to no purpose whatever.</p><p>MATRIMONIAL.</p><p>Last Friday evening Fred. O'Brien married Miss Mary Crosswhite, of this town. Fred. was formerly a good Comstocker, and played the tuba, or mammoth Ramshorn, in Rippingham's brass band. He plays the same in our excellent local band, and, being a first-class musician as well as a first-rate fellow generally, he has plenty of good friends. About fifty ladies and gentlemen were present at the wedding, and the band came and serenaded; and there was lots of good singing and good things to eat and drink, and everybody went home happy. His brother musicians all wish his married live may be one long harmonious tune, with happy variations and no discords.</p><p>""BOWERS.""</p><p>This is a name given by our miners to the poorest class of their ore. Those working on tribute, especially, sort their ore very carefully, breaking it with a small hammer on an anvil and distributing it into three or four piles. The first-class may be worth $2,000 per ton; the second, $400; third, $125; and the rest is thrown out as waste. This third or poorest grade then all call ""Bowers,"" or, more properly spelled, Bauer's. I asked a tributing ore-sorter the other day why such a peculiar name was given to that class of ore. He said: ""You see, after the milling, discount and other drawbacks are taken out of it, what little there is left goes for beer; so we call it ""Bauer's."" By way of further explanation, I will state that Gus Bauer is the well-known brewer of Austin, and brews the only genuine lager beer in this state. The delegates to the Odd Fellows' Grand Lodge from your section all pronounced it the true business, and would drink nothing else.</p><p>A REAR ATTACK.</p><p>A couple of our most prominent and orderly citizens got into a spat the other day about the collections for the coming Fourth of July celebration. Mean words passed and one kicked the other. The kicker was arrested on charge of assault and battery, and to-day a jury trial before Justice Weller was the result. The strongest point in evidence hinged on whether the victim told the other to kiss or kick him, and two witnesses swore that he said both. So the jury immediately gave in a verdict of not guilty. The trial was a very funny one, with a crowded audience, and for lively interest came fully up to the Democratic Convention.</p><p>FISH STORIES..</p><p>Down at Ledlie, on Reese river, half a dozen miles from here, a large salmon of the land-locked variety is reported to have been caught and placed in a small pond for people to look at. It came up the river from the Humboldt, and its weight has been variously estimated by sundry veracious persons at from thirty to 180 pounds. If that fish is not killed soon he will weigh a couple of tons before the Summer is over. The other day Uncle Isaac James, Bob Boyle and Billy Ohugemar went down to the river fishing. It was a hot day, but they sat under the shade of the mushrooms along the banks and fished very comfortably for four hours without getting a bite. Suddenly Bob waked out of a sound snooze and excitedly shouted: ""Look here, boys ! I've got him ! One of them bit fish from the Humboldt ! Lord, how he springs my pole. See that, now."" Just then his pole snapped short off in the middle. Bob rushed frantically and grabbed the piece with the line to it. Then he followed up the line till he found his baited hook stuck fast in one of those big mushrooms, not having been in the water at all. Bob's exploit waked up Uncle Isaac, who pulled in his line and found he had forgotten to bait his hook. Billy crawled out from under his toadstool, rubbed his eyes and hitched up the horses to the buckboard, saying he thought 'twas about time they went back home. Then they borrowed an ax, and in ten minutes loaded their vehicle with choice mushrooms, and treated their friends freely to them when they got back home to Austin, declaring that was what they went after. They report mushrooms standing so thick in some of the fields along the river as to completely cover the ground, like a great white scab.</p><p>LOCAL REFLECTIONS.</p><p>Quite a snug little sum of money has been raised for the celebration of the coming Fourth in true Austin and Gold Hill style.</p><p>The closing examination for the term of our public schools is progressing, and the pupils are acquitting themselves very creditably. The schools will close for a two month's vacation next Thursday.</p><p>A Blaine and Logan Club will be formed here after the Fourth.</p><p>Kites of all sizes and degrees of meritorious construction are seen floating in the air on favorable days. The heathen Chinee is the boss kite-maker.</p><p>Sagebrush is used to a considerable extent as fuel, especially by the Piutes about town. And as it burns it sends forth upon the atmosphere a very di-stink-tive, original or aboriginal smell.</p><p>If the present weather indications hold out, the chances for a good crop of cloudbursts during the season will be excellent.</p><p>Louis Loustalot, of the Lafayette restaurant, looks as much like Ben Butler as a twin brother. And he is a Democrat, but he swears that if the party nominate old Ben he won't vote for him. He says he has run a restaurant too long to admire a man who steals spoons.  ALF.

July 9, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Austin's Fourth of July -- Goddesses -- Cannon -- The Old Stiffs -- Cousin Jack's View of the Situation -- Wood River and Coeur d'Alene Returns -- Cloudbursts -- Senatorial -- Etc.</p><p>Correspondence of the Enterprise .</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., July 6, 1884</p><p>The greatest of all American National days was celebrated here in properly glorious style day before yesterday. We had the conventional procession, oration, poem, reading of the Declaration, music by the band, benediction, etc. -- same as they did in thousands of other communities throughout the Republic. Yet our procession differed from all others in that our Car of State was a genuine railroad car, drawn by a locomotive. This style of team, named ""Mules' Relief,"" is special and peculiar to Austin. It also hauled another car filled with children and people of all sizes and ages, and the decorations were elaborately fine and tasteful. The Car of State, with its crowd of little girls, ranged in seats one above another, and all dressed in white with red and blue sashes and ribbons and each waving a gay little flag, reminded one of a grand, lovely bouquet of rosebuds, surmounted by a sweetly, blooming young rose, representing the Goddess of Liberty. And it was a real, live, human, happy bouquet, representing the home paradise of earth as well as the kingdom of heaven. I sometimes wonder if each succeeding generation of little girls is really prettier than the last, and, anyhow, feel disinclined to consider even the possibility that this huge car-load of sweet, pretty little misses can ever grow up to be wrinkled, snuffy-nosed, vinegar-faced matrons, or vicious, snaggle-toothed old mothers-in-law. Manhattan Hose Company had a duplicate goddess, and the boys, in their neat uniform, marched like a guard of honor, and as festively proud as did the numerous gay companies of the old Virginia and Gold Hill Volunteer Fire Departments in the blooming and booming days, when the Comstock goose hung high and nobody cared a dern for expense. They used to run half a dozen or more goddesses sometimes. We are noways short of goddesses here, but comparatively short of companies to parade them.</p><p>INCIDENTALS.</p><p>Owing to the strategy of Lieutenant Governor Laughton in getting our time-honored big cannon away for exhibition in Carson, the little gun cast at the Manhattan foundry had to do the national saluting on this occasion. It is of the bull-fyste order, little, but willing, and the artillery boys running it fed powder into it by the hatfull, then got out of the way and pulled the string. After each discharge they had to hunt up the gun, but they managed to keep it bouncing pretty regularly while each salute lasted. Of course everybody stuck up their flags. In fact I think there were about seven flags displayed for every man, woman and child in Austin. Ranchers, with wives and families, were in from the surrounding country, and the Piutes had on their best holiday rig. But this kind of a celebration does not suit our hungry Piute citizens half so well as a barbecue or a high-toned Chinese funeral. Professor Bristow's oration was a most worthy effort, and Mrs. Vollmer read Longfellow's poem, ""America,"" very acceptably. Hon. H. T. Creswell read the Declaration just as well as anybody can, and all who knew it was not his own original production encouragingly applauded him as he waded through his laborious task. The band and the military did themselves and the occasion high honor, and we all feel justly proud of them. It is seldom that a celebration passes off anywhere as smoothly and satisfactorily .</p><p>THE ""OLD STIFFS.""</p><p>Lander Post, of the Grand Army of the Republic, showed interestingly in the procession, but not strong in point of numbers, like the Reese River Pioneers. The ball of the Pioneers in the evening was very well attended, but almost entirely by comparatively juvenile people. Thanks to a complimentary invitation from the society, I was present for a time, but had to quit because so few could come up to my style of dancing. Even the old veteran, John Frost, although the chief in the manipulation of mining pumps, is just nowhere in dancing pumps.</p><p>""COUSIN JACK""</p><p>Laid down his pick and was ""on top"" that day. All the miners, of whatever nationality, that could be spared, had a holiday, and with their imposing numbers and honest substantial appearance formed a materially interesting feature of the procession. And Cousin Jack entered into the spirit of the occasion as enthusiastically as any native born citizen. Said he: ""You see the old country was obliged to separate from the new, because ee was gettin' to big for 'er. Good thing 'nuff for both of 'em; 'ooray for the Queen and the Heagle hennyow. Coom in 'ere old son, thee'll be called on for a song next. Just look at the bunch 'o Gold 'Illers 'round the table in the corner - Old man Luke, Billy Benny, Simmons, Bawden, George Laity and Joppa Bennetts - 'Eres to the lads; 'eres to the old Comstock; 'ooray for the Fourth!"" Cousin Jack's rich voice rolled forth in melodious chorus, responsively to many a ""worthy call,"" during the last two evenings, but to-day being Sunday, he considers the celebration over, and will go to work with all hands as usual to-morrow.</p><p>RETURNINGS.</p><p>Harry Bluett, formerly well-known on the Comstock, returned to Austin the other day, from a six months' visit to the Wood River country. He talks as if he was glad to get back, though he says he had a pretty good time and saw lots of good people, found many old Nevada friends and was well treated generally. The Minnie Moore mine at Bellevue and the Elkhorn and Parker mines at Ketchum were the best mines he saw to support those towns, and Hailey seemed to derive its chief importance and support from being the county seat of Alturas county. He does not, in fact, seem deeply impressed with the present and future prospects of the Wood River section. He saw also hundreds of returning prospectors from the Coeur d'Alene. they were all on foot, and sore footed at that, packing their blankets and glad to get somewhere. They were unanimous in denouncing Coeur d'Alene as a pretty tough humbug. The only returning traveler from there who had any good word to say for the country and the mines was a Chicago drummer who retained money enough to pay railroad fare instead of walking like the rest. Harry has concluded to send for his wife and make his permanent home in Austin.</p><p>PROGNOSTICAL.</p><p>All weather indications go to show that a big old time cloudburst may be looked for most any day during the next two or three months.</p><p>If John Mackay wants to be the next United States Senator for Nevada, he will be, if not, you have another man in the western part of the State who is well deserving and capable, and can be Senator if he likes.</p><p>ALF.

July 13, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Completion of the Austin Street Railway Through to the Manhattan Mines—Steepest Railroad in the World—Plunger Pump—Busy Scenes—The Doctor Called For—Water Reserves—Something About Soapsuds—Fruit and Vegetables--Butterflies, Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., July 10, 1884.</p><p>Aside from the general interest we all take in the troubles and trials of the Democracy at Chicago, one of the most important items of local interest, so far as this community is concerned, was the completion of the Austin Street Railway this day from the Nevada Central depot, at the mouth of the canyon, below town, through to the Paxton incline on Lander Hill, away above town. This is the highest point in the mines or mining works of the Manhattan Company desired to be attained at present, by the locomotive, although a few hundred yards more road will be constructed to a point opposite the Lander shaft, where a very steep tramway and stationary engine will elevate wood and supplies and lower rich ores, to and from the aforesaid shaft, where the most elevated and efficient works of the company are carried on. The railroad depot of the Nevada Central is about half a mile or thereabout below town, where Pony Canyon opens into Reese River Valley, and the entire length of the narrow gauge road belonging to the Austin Street Railway Company to the Paxton incline is something over two miles. The height surmounted is between 800 and 900 feet, or over 400 feet to the mile, constituting it the steepest plain railroad of its length in the United States or the world. The mill of the Manhattan Company is 500 feet higher than the Clifton or Nevada Central depot, and the Paxton incline works are 300 feet still higher. This new section of the railway, from the mill to the mines, has been surveyed and contemplated for some time, but has been made a practical reality only within the past two months. Winding around the steep hillsides, with the unprecedented up-grade described, it passes right among the principal mining works of the company, and will prove of great practical utility in the matter of transportation. Its completion and the passage of the locomotive through to the Paxton terminus this afternoon was made the occasion of local congratulation. The whistles of the mining works tooted a noisy passing salute, and the surface employees drank sundry kegs of cool beer brought up by the locomotive, direct from the brewery. Your correspondent incidentally had the honor of being the first and only through passenger over the entire length of the road. It is now and forever too late for any one else in the world to brag of this. The climbing capabilities of the famous locomotive, which is appropriately named Mule's Relief, are limited only to the height of the mountain it may be desired to climb.</p><p>THE BIG PUMP.</p><p>The ten-inch Cornish plunger pump mentioned in a former letter as being put into the Frost shaft is now nearly ready for work, and will probably start into practical operation in the course of a week or ten days. It consists, in fact, of two pumps, from the Sierra Nevada new works, near your city. The ponderous pump-bob, from the Woodville works, Lower Gold Hill, is in position ready to connect, the powerful engine in place, and about half the pump rod is in. This is of Oregon pine timbers, ten inches square and in sections of from thirty-seven to fifty-two feet in length, very substantially spliced and strapped together. This pump will have a stroke of eight feet, and raise the water from a perpendicular depth of 570 feet. With nine or ten strokes a minute it is expected to raise 10,000 gallons an hour, and keep the entire system of mines at this point drained with perfect ease working half the time, or twelve hours in twenty-four. Under the direction of the old engineering manager, John Frost, all this heavy work has been mostly managed thus far without an accident or blunder. As for Superintendent Curtis, he is to be found everywhere in the thickest of the fray, making himself useful as well as ornamental, in the mines, in the mill, on the cars, surveyor, engineer, brakeman, shift boss and general roustabout.</p><p>A RUN FOR THE DOCTOR.</p><p>As we were returning from the mines, in passing a small house just above the Manhattan mill, a woman came running out waving her hands, and directly the locomotive came to a standstill. With tears flowing down her cheeks she shouted, ""Oh, please won't you tell Dr. Hammond to hurry up here quick? My little girl is dying."" Engineer Hale responded with a prompt touch of the lever, and away went the gallant little motor at a lively rate of speed for about a third of a mile, stopping in front of the drug store, where fireman Rice found the Doctor, who sprang on board, and in just seven minutes from the time the weeping mother spoke, the motor had performed its impromptu errand, and the Doctor was by the side of her afflicted little one.</p><p>LARGE BOX OF WATER.</p><p>Near the Frost shaft a pretty good sized tank, or reservoir, for water pumped from the mines has been recently constructed. It is twenty-eight feet wide and fifty six feet long and ten feet deep, and its full capacity is 118,000 gallons. This is intended for supplying the fire department hydrants down town and for door-yard irrigation, street sprinkling and all that sort of thing. There is another reservoir of smaller size near the mill, heretofore used for the same purpose, but this new one is over 200 feet higher, with that much more pressure.</p><p>AGRICULTURAL.</p><p>The fruit crop from California is fine and very abundant. It would be cheap, were it not for the costly freight. In fact, a fellow feels as though he was eating freight instead of fruit, and the cost lies heavy in his stomach as well as purse. The vegetable crops about town and on the ranches are splendid, and so are the grain and hay crops. The sagebrush never looked more verdantly luxuriant, and flowers of all styles of beauty and limited degrees of fragrance cover the hills and valleys. But among all the vegetable productions of this State, I have not yet seen any of that peculiar husky vegetable so plentifully and universally known over in California as</p><p>SOAPROOT.</p><p>I was mentioning this circumstance to Mr. Dadd, the other day, and he agreed with me that such was the fact; he, one of the oldest pioneers, had found none here. He considered it an important element of prosperity which was lacking, and had felt lonely without it ever since he left the old California diggin's. Says he: ""When I was minin' jest below Dutch Flat in the Spring of '52, me and my partner was out in the hills one day and we found some green shoot growin' that he said was wild mustard. We gathered a lot, and next biled it with some bacon for dinner. It tasted fine, and we both took in a pretty good feed of it. But in less'n an hour we commenced to bloat up and swell and feel like we was going to bust. Next thing we got to frothin' at the mouth, and was afraid we was pizened. We didn't feel sick any, but mighty oncomfortable. The white froth jest rolled out of us, and directly we dropped on it that it was young soaproot stalks we had been eatin'. For over three hours the soapsuds jest biled out of us by the wheebarrow-load and was knee-deep all over the cabin. Jim had a small mouth and bad delivery, so it served him wuss than me, for--- Yes, thank ye, don't mind if I do take a little beer.""</p><p>MISCELLANEOUS.</p><p>Butterflies are very numerous throughout Austin, and all the juvenile whites and Piutes are after them with little hoop nets, bunches of sagebrush, old jackets and all sorts of contrivances. It is not safe or pleasant to be a butterfly.</p><p>The disease which has recently become so prevalent here, is professionally stated to be epidemic influenza, appearing and developing locally in the throat, but affecting the entire system.</p><p>The farmers down in the valley have commenced cutting their hay. In some places along the river they will have to use boats, or wait till next season.</p><p>Stillwater Thompson and other Piutes have fitted themselves out with new linen dusters and whatever than can pick up, and gone to Wadsworth to a big fandango.</p><p>ALF.

July 20, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Cheerful Republicans -- Eight to Seven -- Political Fallacies and Speculations -- Ben Butler -- Lice and Worms -- A Reese River Ranch and a Cattle Branding Circus -- Dangerous Horns and Lively Dodging -- Indian Strategy -- A Barbarously Trimmed Steer -- A Point in Fattening -- Winter Still Lingers, Etc -- A Notable Visitor -- The Elephant -- An Artful Dodger .</p><p>Correspondence of the Enterprise.</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., July 17, 1884.</p><p>""Hurrah! for Cleveland,"" has been the popular cry here since the great Democratic National Convention at Chicago concluded its mountainous labors and brought forth two such small mice as Cleveland and Hendricks. But the Republicans do the hurrahing over the proposition, and the disappointed Democracy enthuse not over them worth shucks, so to speak. They were nominated on Friday, ""Hangman's Day,"" and the proper head of the ticket being blunderingly hung on to the tail, the defective outfit will be more easily strangled by the Republican rope next November. After waiting eight years for ""vindication,"" it would have been at least decent to have placed the only active survivor of the ""eight to seven fraud"" at the head of the ticket. And it does not always follow that in order to carry New York for the Presidency a New Yorker must be nominated. Surely the Democracy should learn wisdom from disastrous experience and defeat in that respect during the past twenty years. McClellen in 1864, Seymour in 1868, Greeley in 1872, Tilden in 1876, and in 1880 Hancock, who was more of a New Yorker than anything else, was also defeated. Our sagacious friend Spykens, who sets himself up for quite a political sharp, considers this simply a strategic movement in favor of Blaine, and that Ben Butler is at the bottom of it. Old Ben worked all sorts of roots to become Governor of Massachusetts, was defeated year after year as often as he tried it on, but at last succeeded, even as the cockeyed old warrior hopes to eventually succeed in. becoming President of this great American republic. And Spykens predicts that the Democratic party will nevermore achieve success till they nominate and elect old Ben Butler for President.</p><p>LOUSY.</p><p>Hopkins, agent for the ENTERPRISE in this burg, has more lice than anybody. He has a large plum tree just loaded with them. A few big blue flies, somewhat smaller than humming birds, lighted on the tree, and four days after he found the green leaves perfectly alive with small green lice, hatching out from flyblows. On some of the branches they swarmed in huge clusters like bees, and in a few hours began changing to worms of various sizes and degrees of variety, devouring the leaves and sapping the twigs. He found the most effectual remedy was to trim off the limbs and burn them. His plum crop will be omitted this season. Several old Reese River pioneers who saw this affluent display of lice declared with tears in their eyes that it reminded them of the good old times. This seems to be an unusually good year for lice and worms in garden vegetables, trees, and even in grain fields. But the glorious old sagebrush, with its aromatic smell, and pungent, griping taste, is proof against all such creeping vermin, and flourishes in triumphant luxuriance and aboriginal beauty.</p><p>REESE RIVER RANCHING.</p><p>The other day I took a little ride out in the country, to Rooker and Soule's ranch in Reese River Valley, some sixteen miles from here. A friend, interested in beef culture, was with me and told me all he knew about the country -- more than I knew or could take note of myself. We passed Billy Jones' and many other notable ranches, also numerous miles of wire fences, through various stray streams and mudholes, and were hospitably received on arriving at our destination. It is principally a stock ranch, although a considerable portion of it yields heavy crops of hay. The erratic Reese sinks at this point for about ten miles, reappearing in full volume through some heavy springs just above Jones' ranch . Plenty of water is found half a dozen feet below the surface, and a handsome, very effective windmill, of the Althouse pattern, with pump and capacious tank, supplies all the water needed for the cattle and horses. A well of excellent, soft, cool water for domestic use is also near the house. Joe Porter, an old resident, has charge of the ranch, and Mrs. Wilbur is housekeeper, her husband being employed on the ranch.</p><p>CATTLE BRANDING.</p><p>After a very enjoyable dinner, or noon lunch, we went out to the corral near by and witnessed the interesting operation of branding a small drove of cattle which were brought in from Smoky Valley the day previous. Quite a number of Piutes, as well as white men, were employed, and some of the cattle being rather wild, some very lively, as well as dangerous, sport was experienced. In fact at times it looked much like a Spanish bull-fight. Three or four adventurous whites and Indians would be in the corral at a time trying to lasso an animal, yet all the while on their guard, ready to run for the fence in case of an attack from some belligerent cow or steer. Especially was this the case after an animal had been thrown and branded. The lasso being cast over his horns, he was speedily bowsed up to the ""snubbing post,"" and another rope being dexterously cast around the hind legs, the unfortunate brute was speedily stretched out backward and thrown upon his side. Then the big branding irons heating in the fire just outside of the fence were passed in and made to burn large lettered devices upon the side and shoulder, and a peculiar clip with a sharp knife was taken from each ear. Then came more fun, for the moment the lassos were removed, the panting, infuriated animal sprang to his feet and went for his fleeing tormentors. Away they ran for the bars, climbing rapidly out of the way, leaning over and kicking their heels hilariously in the face of the snorting, pawing brute so savagely shaking his horns at them.</p><p>A NARROW ESCAPE.</p><p>Jack, one of the Indians, was a little out of luck, or time, on one occasion. J.. furious steer, with smoking sides and bleeding ears, got after him so closely that, having one of his hands crippled, he could not climb out of reach soon enough. But, quick as a flash he dropped on his side and rolled close up to the bottom of the fence, where the animal could not easily reach or injure him with his horns before his companions attracted or drove him away. It was simply a well-known dodge, understood by all old bullfighters, and very cleverly executed.</p><p>PECULIARLY BARBAROUS</p><p>It looked rough and barbarous enough to thus throw, burn and mutilate the poor beasts, but still further cruelty was reserved for the largest and oldest animal in the herd. He was a great slab-sided, raw-boned, long-horned old steer, a brand-scarred veteran, and evidently a pioneer. They seared his hide deeply with the seething brand, lopped his ears and even cut off his tail, and he stood it like a philosopher, but when the operator took an ax and whacked away at his horns to knock them off close to his head, he bellowed and struggled wildly. It was decidedly a brutal job, but said to be necessary, for that the animal never could get fat with those horns and that tail on him. After he was allowed to get up he cleared the corral of his tormentors directly, being evidently desirous of getting even on somebody, and feeling like a defeated and sore-headed political candidate. In fact he made himself so viciously obnoxious that he had to be turned out of the corral before the circus exercises could be concluded.</p><p>LOCAL NOTES</p><p>Day before yesterday we had a violent snow, hail and rain storm, which left the mountain tops well whitened, and next morning a heavy white frost covered the awnings, roofs, etc., along Main street. Rather cool and refreshing for the middle of July.</p><p>United States Mint Director, Hon. H. C. Burchard, arrived on the train last night. He is on his return to Washington from a visit to the United States Mints on this coast, and visited Austin, for the first time, in order to collect statistics of mining operations, mineral and bullion production, etc. He visited the mines and mill of the Manhattan Company, and will visit other localities on his way eastward, leaving here to-morrow morning.</p><p>The agent for Cole's big white elephant circus also arrived last night, and has been decorating the town with gay pictures and handbills to-day. The show is to appear here August 13.</p><p>The big Cornish plunger pump of the Manhattan Company, mentioned in my last letter, will start into operation next Saturday or Sunday.</p><p>When the Piutes left for the big fandango at Wadsworth, the other day, a dark-complexioned young man about town, who wanted to go in that direction and had no coin to pay his fare, rigged himself up as a squaw and passed along without any difficulty. The Piutes enjoyed the joke and didn't give him away. </p><p>ALF. DOTEN. </p>",public://territorial/TE56.jpg,territorial
TE57,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Wednesday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . July 30, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Reese River Valley, Topographically, Agriculturally and Hydropathically Considered -- A Very Peculiar River -- Nevada's Isolated Mining Points -- Reese River Architecture -- Immense Deposits of Roofing Material -- Political Ruminations -- Health Problems -- A Pump from the Comstock -- A Bloody Tongue Episode -- A Gagged Official -- Gone to Lake Tahoe -- 601 -- Circus – Moon.</p><p>Correspondence of the Enterprise.</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev. , July 26, 1884</p><p>In my last letter I did not record quite all the notes and observations taken on my recent trip through the principal agricultural and cattle cultural range of this section, so here we have a little more on the subject:</p><p>REESE RIVER VALLEY</p><p>Is about 150 miles long, its mouth intersecting Humboldt river and the Central Pacific Railroad at Battle Mountain, some ninety miles from Austin. Like most Valleys it is widest at the lower end, but at this point, and for forty miles above, it averages about six or eight miles in width. It is a treeless expanse of territory, monotonous, with gently indulating sagebrush wastes and occasional alkali patches, yet embracing vast ranges of excellent pasturage and broad wire--fenced tracts of good haying and agricultural ground, especially bordering along the river. White sage, the best Winter feed for cattle and sheep in the country, is abundant in many places along the borders of the valley on either side. Some of the creeks or mountain canyons, which open into the valley, also contain good pasture ranges and agricultural lands, where excellent potatoes and other vegetables are raised, also sundry fine fields of alfalfa. One would naturally suppose that in this fertile valley, supplied with pure, soft river water, trees should line the banks of the stream, yet not even shrubbery is to be seen. Various parties have made attempts to establish shady groves and orchards, but their trees all died, owing probably to an overplus of alkali or other detrimental element in the soil. This total absence of trees makes the valley look much more barren than it really is.</p><p>REESE RIVER.</p><p>It seems like a burlesque to call such an insignificant, uncertain stream a river. Where not obstructed by dams, it is, generally speaking, but a few yards or feet in width, and its volume of water is decidedly an indefinite, unknown quantity. Only about once in ten years, for instance during a season of extraordinary wetness like the past Winter and Spring, this stream becomes of sufficient magnitude to flow from its source continuously through to its intersection with the Humboldt -- 150 miles. During ordinary seasons it is not to be seen flowing one-third of that distance. Opposite here is a section of it which holds good from Jones' ranch, where it rises to the surface through large springs, to Wiggin's ranch, a distance of twelve miles, to where it abruptly sinks. The old emigrant and stage road across the continent at this point crosses the valley, and here the weary pioneer emigrant found good water and good feed for his suffering cattle and horses. Above Jones' is a section of ten miles where the river flows under ground. It is a fine, fertile section, and water is naturally found in abundance by sinking a few feet most anywhere -- soft, pure and cool. Above this ten-mile section to its mountain source, a distance of about forty miles, the stream is continuous and flows in the light of day. Trout, suckers and catfish are found in it, the latter being planted there some years ago.</p><p>ISOLATED.</p><p>Viewed from the valley, the mines of Austin, or Lander Hill, look like an isolated strike, so to speak. They were found through being on the old overland emigrant line of travel, and from the distance show no marked, natural configuration, or prominent mineral formation or outcrop to distinguish them from the general characteristics of numerous similar localities to be seen all along the Toiyabe range. A large amount of prospecting work is observable at various equally eligible points, but with no satisfactory result. Perhaps, however, equally as good or better mines may be eventually discovered at various neighboring points. The rich mines of the Comstock, Eureka, White Pine and Pioche are similarly and unreasonably isolated. The mines of Como are also remarkably isolated, but they never paid the tenth part of any per cent on the money and labor invested.</p><p>ARCHITECTURAL.</p><p>The houses of the numerous ranchers along Reese River Valley are not of the Grecian or Doric order of architecture, but rather of the Greaseran or Adobic style, being composed of adobes or sundried mud bricks, like the old houses of native Californians and Mexicans. These Reese River adobes are made about eight inches wide, a foot long and four inches thick, from the best of alkali mud, and form the walls and partitions. The roofs are rather flat, and made of willow poles covered with sagebrush, and good, stiff mud slapped on top three or four inches thick. It is immensely cheaper than shingles, is this mud, for it is proof against water, snow, fire or frost. Should the roof happen to leak a little at any point, some time, a shovelful of mud will stop it perfectly and effectually in no time at all. These houses need no painting, but are of a delicate light slate-color all over -- it would be like painting the lily. The doors, floors and windows form the only expense in building Reese River residences, but they are tastefully fitted up inside, and are among the most comfortable houses in the world. This alkali mud roofing is found in natural deposits a mile wide and a thousand feet deep all over the valley. There is enough of it to roof all the cities in the world. What a fine chance for an enterprising speculation.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>Politics begins to convulse this section considerably, and quite frequently three or four or five citizens, responsible or otherwise, are to be seen at a time earnestly discussing the various merits, demerits, availability and chances of the respective aspirants for nomination by either of the contesting political parties. Jones seems to have the inside track as his own successor to the United States Senate, and Stephens, Woodburn, Powning and Foley are favorably mentioned for Congressional Representative. Congressman Cassidy has made a good record for himself, not being backward in expressing his views on any of the political questions affecting this State or the nation generally. Austin, at the last State election, gave a majority of 22 for Governor, but 3 Republican majority for Lieutenant Governor, 2 Republican for Congressman and 33 Republican for Supreme Judge, therefore can be counted Republic an by a small majority. Lander county, however, went Democratic for all the State officers except Treasurer, Uncle George Tufly coming out 26 ahead. On this subject of political points, our mutual friend Spykens says the new Democratic platform reminds him of the 2nd Chapter of 2nd Peter, in the New Testament, the 19th and 22nd verses of which read as follows:</p><p>""While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption, for of whom a man is overcome"" of the same is he brought in bondage. ""</p><p>""The dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.""</p><p>SANITARY.</p><p>Thus far the Summer heat in this section has not been oppressive, in fact not quite up to the usual standard by half a dozen degrees, to-day being the hottest of the season -- ninety degrees. It would seem like healthy weather, yet there is considerable sickness prevailing in the form of sore throat, influenza, etc., with a few fatal cases resulting. This is evidently a sympathetic community, so to speak; when one person gets sick the whole town follows suit. Three or four months ago everybody had the measles, and now it is the influenza; cholera morbus or something of the sort may be expected next.</p><p>THE BIG PUMP.</p><p>The big Cornish plunger pump of the Manhattan Company got started a little on Monday afternoon for the first time, and next day went into active service, working just as smoothly and regularly as though it had been successfully running for six months, and it continues doing so. With a ten-inch pump column it raises the water at two lifts 570 feet, draining all the mines to the depth of 200 feet below the present general workings. It took over fifteen tons of counter-weight ballast in the balance bob to stand off the wiight of the pump rod. The engine is of the horizontal style, seventy--five--horse power capacity, with Putnam valve gearing, and three feet stroke. Its foundations, including the pit for the bob, are of the most massive and substantial character possible. The pump has an eight-foot stroke, and can raise 15,000 gallons an hour, although it is now running at about half that rate, nothing more being required at present. A commodious building is now being erected over the whole plant, and when all the carpentering is completed the works will be the best of the company, and compare favorably with the best in the State. The credit of adopting, procuring and placing this effective pumping proposition is due to Superintendent Curtis, and his views and plans have been most faithfully and well carried out by Chief Engineer John Frost. It gives all needed facilities for draining the mines and working hundreds of feet below the present lowest plane of operations more economically than ever, adding much to the prosperity of the company and the resultant benefit of the community generally.</p><p>TONGUE AND PEN.</p><p>Day before yesterday a well known and popular gentleman, who evidently has not got wholly weaned from his schoolboy habits, while writing in the discharge of regular official duty, inadvertently drew his pen across his mouth or tongue, spitting out the ink, as usual. It was a steel pen, and one side of it was defectively sharp. He hardly knows himself how it was done, but a deep gash was made into his tongue, which bled profusely, a blood vessel having evidently been cut. He had to calI on a surgeon, who applied powerful styptics and a big wad of lint. Never was a poor fellow in such a queer fix. There were times when he was obliged to speak, but his mouth was too full for utterance, and the moment the impediment was removed his tongue bled more copiously than ever. He has scarcely eaten anything for two days, and could only drink a glass of beer occasionally by sucking it through a reed pipe-stem. The last two nights he has been compelled to sleep with his mouth jammed full of lint and a bandage tied across to keep it in place. Today the bleeding has ceased, and the wound is evidently healing, but he is still apprehensive, and swears that never, never again will be use his tongue for a pen-wiper.</p><p>CHIT-CHAT</p><p>Superintendent Curtis, of the Manhattan, has gone with his wife and two or three lady and gentleman friends for a two weeks' vacation at Lake Tahoe. They proposed stopping at John McKinney's place, on the other side of the lake, and are doubtless having a good time at that most enjoyable of all Summer resorts.</p><p>Private picnic parties are frequent, though there are no shady groves to go to, yet the shade of a buggy, by the side of a stream of water, with green grass or pig weeds to sit on, is better than nothing, and then there's the ride there and back. The grand picnic excursion of the Miners' Union down the valley to Vaughn's ranch, next Saturday, promises to be a very successful and enjoyable affair. The cars run directly to the grounds, and there are some willows and grass and a clear, running brook. Even grass widows are popular at an Austin picnic.</p><p>A day or two ago two suspicious characters, called ""Wild Bill"" and the ""Broadcloth Gambler,"" were notified to leave town, because they were thought to be connected with a recent attempt at burglary. They left.</p><p>Cole's Circus is the best billed of any ever appearing here, and the Piutes are in a maze of wonder and delight, contemplating the gorgeous galleries of magnificent pictures, covering whole sides of buildings. Every Piute, little and big, will be present when the show opens.</p><p>Again comes up the popular dispute as to whether the present new moon is a dry or a wet one. The established rule is that when it tips up so that the old Indian hunter can't hang his powder horn on to the lower point, it is a dry -- or a wet one -- or both -- I forget which. Anyhow it is a correct and reliable rule.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN. </p>",public://territorial/TE57.jpg,territorial
TE58,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . August 17, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Impending Cloudburst -- Horse and Elephant Opera -- Some Circus Reflections -- Short Grass and a Lamb Tale -- Reese River Flowers -- Austin Agriculture -- Ground Pepper and How to Assay it-- An Absconded Medicine Man -- Politics, Matrimony, Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., August 14, 1884.</p><p>To-morrow will be the anniversary of the fearful cloudburst and flood which so sweepingly devastated Austin in 1878. It occurred at 4 o'clock P.M. A huge, black and soggy old water-logged cloud harikaried itself upon the extensive water shed at the head of Pony Canyon, and the water it shed very suddenly and unexpectedly came rolling and tumbling in huge, tempestuous volume down Main street. Awnings, sidewalks and even some buildings were swept away by the appalling flood and disappeared down the canyon, a man and a mule constituting the list of victims, although there were many narrow escapes from death or serious injury. Now, for about a week, great, black clouds have ominously hovered and portentously thundered around and along the Toiyabe range, and each day the old Reese River pioneer has sagaciously nodded his bald pate toward the threatening heavens as he hopefully predicted the coming cloudburst. Hopefully, for there is not one of these truthful old sinners but would glory in seeing a repetition of the direful calamity they have so eloquently and exaggeratingly bragged about to all recent comers. Not that they would desire any serious damage to be done, but merely as a matter of historical and personal vindication.</p><p>COLE'S BIG SHOW.</p><p>The grand palpitating sensation of the season yesterday came and went. It came like one of those old-time cloudbursts, and its effects were somewhat similar. All day a lively flood, both human and financial, poured down the canyon to the circus ground. Everybody went -- Piutes, Chinese and all -- and the whole surrounding country for dozens of miles was numerously represented. There must have been about 1,500 people present at each performance -- afternoon and evening -- and each and all of the 1,500 consider themselves more or less humbugged and swindled. Oh for a circus or a menagerie that would come even half up to its billed promises. Oh for an impossibility. To-day the truthful old Reese River pioneer gazes despondently at the gay pictured misrepresentations of Cole's show, beautifully and plentifully adorning the entire town, and cheerfully pronounces it the best billed and the biggest bilk of anything since the flood. But Austin is ninety-three miles from the main overland railroad, and the transportation facilities of our local narrow gauge road are, of course, somewhat limited, and too much of a good thing should not be expected; therefore, only thirty-one carloads came, leaving the white elephant, the big elephant, the human fly and other heavy furniture at Battle Mountain. Yet the menagerie department was the best, for the circus was nothing new, and not up to the old regulation style. It had one too many rings, for none but a two-faced or cross-eyed man can satisfactorily watch two ring performances at one and the same time. It was the first circus I ever saw having no lady rider and no clown. Just imagine a circus without a clown -- the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out. The performing ""Arabs"" were hard-looking sons of the desert, and probably good at ""folding the tents and silently stealing away,"" for they didn't show themselves very good at much of anything else. ""Blessed are those who expect nothing, for they shall not be disappointed;"" therefore, nobody here feels very sad over this festive episode, although ""Old King Cole, the merry old soul,"" and his""fiddlers three,"" left at midnight, carrying away all the loose coin in the Reese River section.</p><p>SHORT GRASS.</p><p>The hay crop throughout this section turns out good, and about up to the average, yet on many of the submerged meadows along the river the grass is unusually short, hardly paying to cut for hay. Speaking of this, Sam Fuller, a Reese River pioneer, tells an affecting tale about Somerset county, Maine, where he was born and brought up. It is a very rocky country, therefore sheep have to skirmish around lively to get a living. Sam frequently saw an old sheep lower her lamb by the tail over the edge of a rocky bluff, to pick the grass out of the crevices, the dear little creature filling its mouth and then coming up to divide with its mother. Thousands of sheep got their living and grew fat by this simple, yet very ingenious device. Sam is a democrat, and emigrated to this section a good many years ago, long before the Mormons did. He remembers Gold Hill when its peak was over 300 feet higher than Mount Davidson.</p><p>FLORAL.</p><p>This has been an extraordinary season for flowers, and everywhere on the hills as well as in the valleys many very beautiful varieties are to be found blooming amid the sagebrush. If Professor Lemmon, the botanic Vennor of the Pacific Coast, were here he would doubtless discover many new descriptions of flowers unknown to science. One very rare species of thornless cactus, owing to its peculiar shape and color, I have already named Cactii Limmonii, and then there is a pretty little yellow tulip with a sort of pouch on each leaf, a derringer pocket, as it were, in which it carries its pistils.</p><p>AGRICULTURAL.</p><p>The ravages of the pestiferous army worm have ceased, and door-yard and kitchen-garden agriculture flourishes anew. County Assessor McCafferty saved up his whisky bottles till he got enough to make a nice border around his lettuce patch. The worms devoured all the lettuce and attacked the bottles, but soon got discouraged, or drunk, and died, or evacuated the premises. When they were eating the lettuce he tried to kill them with a copious supply of salt and ground pepper, but they liked the seasoning and called for vinegar and salad oil.</p><p>GROUND PEPPER.</p><p>Speaking of this article, our mutual friend Spykens, who is fond of it, discovered that it made his steak gritty, so he proceeded to assay it. The label on the canister said it was standard ground pepper, and the result proved its correctness -- plenty of ""ground"" in it. He poured a half-pound can of it into a pan of water, stirred and settled it well, washing off the lighter portion, after the style of an old miner panning out gold. When the black pepper was washed off a stratum of white corn meal was reveled, which, on being washed off, left a spoonfull of sand in the bottom of the pan. Any one can easily assay ground pepper in this simple way and prove its correctness. Persons with weak stomachs should grind their own pepper.</p><p>ABORIGINAL GRIEF.</p><p>All day to-day a Piute squaw at the little Indian village on the hillside south of town has kept up a loud and dismal howling. Her husband died last night, and her grief was as sincere and demonstrative as could be desired. This made the third fatal case for the latest medicine man, and his constituency would have made his own case very fatal if they could have found him. He knew that the established disposal of the profession called for his killing, and he didn't care to wait till the boys called on him, so in the darkness of midnight, about the time the circus pulled up stakes, he waited not to fold his tent, but ""silently stole away."" Perhaps he has joined the troupe of performing Arabs. Anyhow, his late neighbors and friends will not enjoy the pleasure of stoning him to death -- rocking him to sleep -- as they kindly did to his predecessor, and a good opening is left for another medicine man.</p><p>PICCALILLI.</p><p>Political wire laying is now in order, also the making of slates. Would-be county officers are plenty, notwithstanding the prospective change from the salary to the fee system. The movements of some of the aspirants, both municipal and legislative, are quite interesting, and may be considered worthy of future mention.</p><p>A rancher from Smoky Valley got very much in love with the seven longhaired sisters in the side show of the circus, and wanted to marry them all. He was willing to embrace Mormonism for their sake.</p><p>The Manhattan mill and big pump are running right straight along and doing excellent work.   ALF.

TE59,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday August 24, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>The Primaries and Delegates - A Political Anomaly - Something About Lawyers - The Filthy Pool of Politics - Domestic Troubles - Badly Foiled Woman - Piute Jealousy - A Prosperous Community</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, Nev., August 21, 1884</p><p>August being put down as the regular cloudburst month, and no such sensational episode having thus far occurred, the old pioneers are declaring it ""off"" for the season; therefore the next thing in order is the Republican primary election next Saturday for delegates to Carson on the 4th of next month. Everybody does not care to go, there not being much in it, so to speak, so a Dutchman, a Cornishman and an American are decided upon to represent Austin, at least that's the way it is told to me by a political insider. It is to be hoped that all three will go, but the chances are that only one will go. Being an emigrant here, comparatively speaking, I am even more bashful politically than I used to be on the Comstock; but I humbly hope that if only one goes, it will be Cousin Jack, with the proxies of the other two in his pocket.</p><p>SUICIDAL.</p><p>One of the queerest of political anomalies consists in the fact that if a good, square English-American Cousin Jack is nominated for office, let him be ever so capable, he is almost sure to be beaten, and by his own nationality. Is it envious jealousy or what is it that induces this? We all know such to be the fact, however. Native Americans and other nationalities vote for him, but he cannot depend upon his own countrymen to squarely back him, as they naturally should. On the contrary, they just coolly repudiate him. ""Its wonderful how they do it, but they do."" And they know they do.</p><p>LAWYERS.</p><p>It seems natural that lawyers should dabble in politics. They always have and they always do. We have only two lawyers in Austin, and one of them has been honorably prominent in the political affairs of this county and State, while the other has been honorably obscure in that respect, yet none the less effective in his quiet way. By the way, according to the Annual Statistician, which is acknowledged standard authority in all matters of statistical or chronological record, out of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence, twenty-five were lawyers. The rest were nine merchants, three statesmen, eight farmers, five doctors, and a printer General, foundrymen, educator, surveyor, soldier, sailor and a shoemaker.</p><p>SLUMGULLION.</p><p>Well, the way filthy, nasty mud is being politically thrown by the newspapers upon Cleveland and Blaine is really discouraging to all decent aspirants for public office. It is a clear case that both should have been hanged years ago or be in the Penitentiary for life. They said the same about Grant, all three being accused of being good men among women. Meanwhile Ben. Butler's familiar cock-eyed old physiog bobs up serenely above the malarious pool, smiling at the idea that the worst that can be said of him is that he stole what spoons he could find in New Orleans. Yet it is perfectly regular and appropriate in all well-ordered old nobility families that the butler should take charge of the spoons. And they were all silver spoons, too, which circumstance indicates that Butler will stand in well for our silver interests, in case he should be elected President, perhaps only second to our worthy Senator Jones. Ah, well, this nasty mud-throwing business will soon play itself out, and after the State Convention at Carson the Republican campaign game may be considered made up, so far as leading State officers are concerned, and good, square standing in for county and legislative officers also will be in order.</p><p>A DOMESTIC EPISODE.</p><p>The other night a woman who formerly lived on the Comstock came up on the train after a little girl nine or ten years of age, which she said belonged to her. She was divorced some years ago, and the father of the child has supported it ever since, giving to the charge of his brother here in Austin, who, with his wife , became very much attached to it. The woman came with an indefinite idea of kidnapping or obtaining possession of the little one by force of arms or something, and going directly to the home of her guardian, she raised merry Gehenna and the whole neighborhood, until gathered in by our faithful Chief of Police, Joe King, and taken to the hotel. By the morning train the little one, in charge of her aunt, departed for Colorado, where her father resides with another wife and children in comfortable circumstances. When this unruly woman found next day that her game had slipped her she became much exasperated, and consulted legal and constabulary authority on the subject, but was advised that she could do nothing. By this time the little girl is happy with her loving father and out of the reach of her unnatural mother. This woman stayed here, conducting herself rather loosely, to say the least, and left for somewhere this morning. Strange to say, she had a pass from a high railroad officer in San Francisco over the Central and Union Pacific roads, and even side lines, telling everybody to give her any reasonable assistance in any respect that she should desire to ask for, and send the bill to him. She is a very pretty little woman, formerly well known at the south end of your city, and at least one of her deserted husbands will recognize her identity on reading this brief sketch.</p><p>ANOTHER DOMESTIC EPISODE.</p><p>""Christian Joe,"" a tall, handsome Piute, had a little trouble yesterday on the sidewalk with his buxom wife. It was apparently a fit of jealousy on her part, but the paroxysm was violent while it lasted. She made a vicious scratch or dig at his eyes, but he was too tall, so she tried to choke him to death with his neck rag, but it came off. Then she destroyed his linen duster and went for his boiled shirt, but he succeeded in twisting away and ran off up the street. She followed, and when she picked up his hat she tore it into four quarters. The last seen of her she was on his trail with tomahawk vengeance in her eye.</p><p>PROSPEROUS.</p><p>Austin is apparently as prosperous as ever at the present time. tlint has just completed and moved into his new fire-proof furniture SDre, other substantial improvements are visible, and people generally seem satisfied to get along do the best they can. The mines are doing well, and the bullion output is very satisfactory, tangible and convincing.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN. </p>",public://territorial/TE59.jpg,territorial
TE60,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Tuesday September 9, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA</p><p>Political, Senatorial, Etc. -- Active Registration of Voters -- Woodburn vs. Cassidy -- A Crippled Miner -- Drunken Catfish -- Cold Moonshine -- Religious Incidentals</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, September 5, 1884</p><p>Throughout Eastern Nevada the political whirl has commenced, and the mythical pot is boiling, and now that the Republican State Convention has set forth its results and its candidates, the aforesaid pot is supposed to boil with constantly increasing ferocity until the grand general election in November. The nomination of Woodburn for Congress and Hawley for Supreme Judge was calculated upon and expected by all Republicans well posted in the inside political policy and with the available personal material of the party. Success, as before remarked, is the grand desideratum in any political party, the nomination of the strongest candidate - the winning horse -- so to speak. The nomination of Woodburn as Congressional Representative from Nevada is a strong one. Others equally strong, and perhaps stronger, could have been made could they have been induced to stand in; but Woodburn is the coming man who is to warm Cassidy's jacket for him properly. Woodburn is a man in the vigorous prime of life, possessed of excellent ability as a statesman and much more than average talent and force as a natural orator. Moreover, he has already very creditably served one term in Congress as Nevada's Representative, and has not to face the Democratic objection to the third term, which most surely must set Cassidy back in case his constituency are properly consistent. As for Hawley, his record for Supreme Judge is very satisfactory and well deserving of continued indorsement; therefore his renomination was a natural consequence, as will be his re-election.</p><p>SENATORIAL.</p><p>For United States Senator for Nevada William Dunphy, the famous cattle king, will most probably be the nominee of the Democracy. He is a gentleman of fine physique, magnetic presence and good address, and cannot be said to possess ""more bullocks than brains,"" for he is intelligent, shrewd, and in real executive ability and bold decisiveness has few superiors. Our present most worthy Senatorial representative, John P. Jones, seems to be the only man to make Dunphy or any other Democratic nominee take a back seat. We all know Jones and his brilliant record in behalf of the true interests of Nevada, and look to him to make a judicious and successful fight. He must and will do it.</p><p>REGISTRATION</p><p>Of voters is, of course, actively going forward here as well as everywhere else. Lander is considered as a Democratic county, or has been heretofore, but judicious political management, as well as natural progressive changes in the minds of the voters, may make it otherwise. The balance of power is light, and not difficult to overcome and control one way or the other, and the Democracy well appreciate this fact, although master of the situation at present. But the fact must not be lost sight of that the Democrats are registering lively, as usual, and not urging Republicans to do so too. Austin's small Democratic majority is very carefully nursed and looked out for.</p><p>A CRIPPLED MINER.</p><p>I see by the Arizona Silver Belt that John Laity, formerly well known on the Comstock, has brought suit against the South Pioneer mine, Gila county, for $20,000 damages, the result of a misfortune in the daily prosecution of his work. He and three other miners were being lowered down the shaft March 12, 1883, by an inexperienced or incompetent person in the employ of the company, when, by a wrong clutch being applied, they were allowed to drop to the bottom, 300 feet, as fast as the reel would allow them. All three were badly hurt. Laity the worst. He had one leg broken and both ankles badly dislocated and injured, making him probably a cripple for life. Laity formerly worked in Gold Hill for several years, principally in the Belcher mine, leaving there for Arizona nearly two years ago. He has many friends to wish him success in his lawsuit.</p><p>SANITARY.</p><p>Whenever any of the old Reese River pioneers, or other ancient relics, get too badly used up by a chronic overplus of whisky or rheumatism they go out to Triplett's Hot Springs, about twenty miles westward from here, in the mountains beyond the valley. There they wallow in soft, black mud and slumgullion for a week or two, or till they soak or poultice all their sins away, and come back looking happy and rejuvenated, with a new lease of life. Whenever one of these old stiffs takes his first swim in the big bathing pond all the catfish go on a hilarious jamboree for three days. Billy Tower and Uncle Isaac James, who have just returned from there, will testify to this fact.</p><p>COLD MOONSHINE.</p><p>Evening before last we had a grand moonlight excursion down to Wiggin's ranch, on Reese river, about a dozen miles from here. Two cars were loaded with about 125 people, including many ladies, and the elite of Austin. It was the finest party gracing such an occasion for a long time. There was plenty of moonlight, but it was clear and coldly beaming. The cars were well fitted with seats, and the ride both ways was very enjoyable. At the grounds was a fine large pavillion, without roof or sides but a good broad floor, and the dancers had to hop around lively to keep warm. There was plenty of good music, good eating, etc., a little side bar and a big bonfire, so everybody contrived to have a pretty good time, although the air was frosty, and overcoats, big shawls and thick wraps were in demand. There were several of the best singers in Austin among the party, and all the way home they gave a continuous grand concert, coming into town a little after midnight with a grand ringing chorus.</p><p>RELIGIOUS.</p><p>The Episcopal parsonage, or rectory, was recently sold for $550, cash, a new one in a better location having been purchased. This is the heaviest transaction in real estate for many months. Rev. Mr. Kirkbride has been appointed Pastor of the Methodist Church, in place of Rev. Hogoboom, deceased.</p><p>ALF DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE60.jpg,territorial
TE61,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday September 21, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Political Buzzing, Points and Prospects -- Still Hunting -- The Coming County Conventions -- Contending Interests -- Tariff Tribulations -- Senator Jones Thereon -- Cousin Jack at Home and Abroad -- A Floating Population -- Political Straws -- Reese River Races and Rackets -- The Mill and the Mines</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, September 19, 1884</p><p>About this time the ambitious aspirant for office and the wide-awake political buzzer are getting in their work very lively, in view of the equinoctial culmination of the political status to take place within the next few days. Day after to-morrow the Democracy of Lander county will hold primaries for delegates to their County Convention, October 1, and one week later the Republican primaries will be held, the time for their County Convention being fixed for October  - three days behind the Democracy. This, of course, is merely a matter of political courtesy on the part of the Republicans, and a delicate recognition of the small, yet predominating Democratic majority and leadership in this county.</p><p>THE STILL HUNT</p><p>Is considered the most effectual style of political work in this section, consequently we have no clubs, spouting demagogues, or howling enthusiasm as yet, though it is hard to tell what may happen before we get through the campaign. One shabby looking person with three pints of whisky in him got on a dry goods box the other evening and undertook to expound the principles of Democracy, but the tariff proposition confounded him, and he wearily sat down, discouraged, retiring to a friendly doorway for a few hours rest and recuperation. We have a very good set of Democratic county officials, all of whom having performed well the duties of their respective offices, naturally desire to be re-elected, with the exception of Treasurer and Sheriff, both of whom modestly stand back. The liveliest contest seems to be between two powerful and popular candidates for Treasurer, and both are working hard for favorable delegates and the nomination at the hands of the convention. Both are quietly, yet very ardently, buzzing around and laying their wires, and every day or two they slip out into the country, hunting or fishing, yet bring home neither rabbits, ducks nor trout. And the only announced Republican candidate for the responsible office, while doing a goodly amount of still hunting for himself, quietly watches them both, hoping that the weakest and least popular of them may get away with the nomination. Austin being the grand metropolis of Lander county, has the lion's share of delegates -- twenty-one out of thirty-nine in the Democratic Convention and twenty seven in the Republicans, consequently Austin has the say and the sway to a majority extent. Battle Mountain, 100 miles hence at the north end, is the next point in voting importance, and has correspondingly just claims for consideration. The Democratic Battle Mountaineers ask as the hands of the Convention, first, a Commissioner; second, Sheriff; third, member of the Legislature. The same may be said of the Republicans at that end of the county. They certainly are entitled to one, if not all three of the positions, and most certainly one of the three Commissioners. Neither party has much to say about members of the Legislature as yet, and no new aspirants came boldly to the front. Some of the old ones, who have been there, signify their willingness to serve again, however, so the country is safe enough on that point, but the selection of county offices seems to be considered of paramount importance. On this special occasion, most certainly, that is an incorrect idea, for the coming Legislature has to elect or re-elect a United States Senator and make some important efforts toward tinkering up our defective State Constitution.</p><p>THE TARIFF.</p><p>This is the knottiest, most irreconcilable and least understandingly discussed of any point in American politics, and very few of our local politicians care to discuss the proposition unless it is forced upon them. In a bar-room discussion the other evening, after Blaine and Cleveland had been disposed of as usual, somebody asked old Jim Sloggers his opinion of the tariff. That solid old pioneer meditatively swallowed another glass of beer, cocked his blessed old sombrero over his larboard ear, twinkled his eyes like shirt-button holes, and sagaciously remarked: ""Well now, gentlemen, this yere tariff question has allers bothered me. Old Reese and me used to talk it over nights when we first discovered and camped along the river. This State don't raise nothin' with protection 'cept silver, and that pays its own tariff. I didn't have nothin' to do with 'lectin Jones, but he's done mighty well for us in protectin' our silver agin Jay Gould, Vanderbilt and othur Greenback ranchers thar in the East. Ef they had their way, in less'n a year silver wouldn't be worth nothin' but to make tin kettles of."" ""Yes, yes, but how about the tariff?"" Old Jim cautiously gulped down another schooner, after the style of popular lecturers taking a glass of water when they come to a hitch in the thread of their discourse, and went on: ""The tariff, boys, is one of the biggest benefits to the country I know of. In seven-up we have high, low game, an' from that we have high, low tariff. Free trade is another branch of the game, got up to rope in the Britishers an' the Chinees. Ef ye conclude ter elect me ter the Carson Legislater, I shall jest go in for combinin' high, low tariff an' free trade together, an' so settle the whole racket satisfactory to all concerned. It might make old Ben Butler President next term, but thar ye have it, anyhow, an' them's my sentiments. Great food for reflection, don't ye see? Call for more beer, somebody; I'm feelin' dry."" His audience admiringly, reflectively and applaudingly responded, yet no one seemed thoroughly enlightened. His views, although uncouthly expressed, are about as clear and sensible, on this subject, as those of many more pretentious and aspiring political expounders. Among the most sensible and concise expressions on the tariff question are those of Hon. J.P. Jones. He believes that everything that can be manufactured or produced at home with the same labor or advantage as the same can be produced abroad, should be protected from foreign competition by a judicious tariff, even though the money price of the home-produced article may, in consequence of higher wages, be permanently higher than the foreign article. He has always been a consistent advocate of good wages for honest labor, and the protection of our home industries from foreign cheap labor competition. On the other hand it would obviously be detrimental policy to obstruct the importation of articles or industries wherein other countries have by climate, location and other natural advantages an invincible superiority over our own in the production. He says: ""No one would propose, for instance, to stimulate by tariff duties the growth of coffee or bananas in this country, or hot-house production of spice or india rubber trees. In such and in similar cases the best policy is to appropriate to our own use the special advantages of other regions, and we effectually do that by free importation, because, in fact the producers are only remunerated for their labor, and scantily at that, while we participate equally with them in the bounties of nature which they enjoy."" On the free trade proposition he says: ""I am opposed to a free trade which subjects the people of this country to the very competition to avoid which either themselves or their ancestors underwent the hazards and dangers of migrating hither. I am opposed to a free trade which reduces the wages of the American laborer to the level of the poorest country in the world, whereas he is entitled to such wages as would result from the material resources and wealth of his own country.</p><p>HOME FROM THE OLD COUNTRY.</p><p>Many Englishmen from Cornwall object to being called Cornishmen, on the ground that it implies an understanding that they are not Englishmen. Yet it is only among the most ignorant classes that the idea can prevail that a Missourian is not an American. In fact, it is really an honorary distinction, for most of us would rather be called a Cornishman than a Cockney, or a Cousin Jack, than a London pick-pocket. This being essentially a mining community, the Cornish element is unusually strong, and many of our best, most loyal and trustworthy American citizens are from the Cornish part of England. They generally prefer working as tributers or leasers in these mines, taking chances on developing good ""pitches,"" or strikes, like old California gold miners, instead of working for regular day wages -- Thus it happens that many of them simply struggle along, month after month, and year after year, just keeping their heads above water, as it were, while others, working no harder, are in prosperous circumstances, and realize small fortunes through incidental good luck. And thus it is that small parties of them frequently go on a visit to their childhood home and friends in the old country. Last February ""Uncle Dick"" Mitchell, Tom Eustace and others made the trip in good style, returning a few days ago with Mrs Mitchell and daughter and Mrs. Bluett, wife of Harry Bluett, formerly well-known among the mining and social fraternity of Gold Hill. Their return trip across the salt water was on the City of Rome, one of the noblest steamships of the Anchor line, or any other line. She is about 600 feet long, and carried 1,700 passengers --about the population of Austin. In fact, they describe it as like being in a big floating town, the long deck resembling a thronged street. The huge vessel ploughed through the rolling salt sea waves like ripples on a mill pond, making the trip from Liverpool to New York in seven days and eighteen hours, her best day's sailing being 430 miles. The boys had a glorious good time, were glad to get back to their sagebrush American home, and have gone to work again with renewed vigor.</p><p>STRAWS.</p><p>When they landed in New York they encountered the reality of the Presidential question, and Cleveland seemed to predominate, but outside of the city Blaine was more popular, and as they came westward the grand chorus was for Blaine all along the line. Coming through Kansas one day in order to ascertain the Presidential views of the passengers on the train, a vote was taken which resulted in 263 for Blaine and 63 for Cleveland, and none for Butler.</p><p>REESE RIVER RIPPLES.</p><p>Last Sunday we had some horse-racing down near the river, which did not exactly throw the records of Flora Temple or Maud S into the shade, but there was lots of fun.</p><p>The other day Dan Wallace, a worthy rancher and County Commissioner, received a letter from a man in Sacramento, kindly informing him that young Wallace, who is at school in that city, had broken his arm and was much in need of $150, which he hoped the father would transmit forthwith. Dan rushed to town, hit the telegraph, and found nothing was the matter with the boy. Somebody didn't pick up $150 by this ingenious little joke.</p><p>Henry Welch, Saul Rosling, Horton and other noted fishermen have distinguished themselves recently by the immense number of chubs they say they have caught in the river. They gave them all away to their friends, therefore they are not worried with bones sticking out through their skins like hogs' bristles.</p><p>Tom Triplett, out at his Hot Springs sanitarium, the other side of the valley, has invented a cage for milking unruly cows. When inside of it they cannot move, and he sits on a piano stool, reaches through the bars, and milks away in perfect comfort and security.</p><p>The Manhattan mill has shut down for a few days in order to make absolutely necessary repairs to the roasting furnace. Meanwhile, work in the mines goes right along as usual, with plenty of ore to keep the mill running when it starts up again.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE61.jpg,territorial
TE62,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday September 28, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Political Primaries -- Cassidy and Woodburn -- Cleveland Discounted Presidential Possibilities -- Irish-American Sense -- Some Legislative Propositions -- State and County Economy -- Constitutional Convention -- St. John, the Evangelist -- Whisky -- Military Revival -- Trout -- Catarrh -- Frost -- Mashed Tomatoes -- Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, September 26, 1884</p><p>Last evening the County Republican Central Committee met and selected twenty-seven delegates to the County Convention on the 4th of next month, to be voted for at the primaries to-morrow. Congressman Cassidy will be present at the primaries, though he is not liable to vote, but in the evening he will deliver his well-written campaign speech with which he has already commenced swinging around the circle among his native sagebrush. Cassidy is a good political worker, and has laid out a lively and extensive amount of work for himself between now and election day. Woodburn, however, will commence camping on his trail shortly. The published test for the democratic primaries last Saturday was merely for the voters to agree to support the nominees of the party at the coming election, but the managers evidently didn't consider that strong and perfect enough, for they asked each voter if it was his intention to support the head of the ticket and vote for Cleveland. Seven said they would not, consequently were barred out, some, of Celtic origin, declared they would not vote for Cassidy or anybody else, as against Woodburn for Congress. There were 168 votes polled, but I hear of several besides those who were barred out who would have voted had not the test been made so stringent in committing them to vote for Cleveland. That illustrious person is not a favorite with the Austin Democrats. As straws are said to show which way the wind blows, and, as there seems to be nothing against Hendricks, perhaps the result of the general election may be Blaine for President and Hendricks for Vice President. In that case Blaine should wear bullet-proof shirts and have his life insured.</p><p>CASSIDY'S CHANCES.</p><p>Our Irish-American fellow citizens are not altogether blind devotees to the Democratic party by any means. They have their eyes open and think for themselves. Many of them are Republicans or next door to it, and go in warmly for Woodburn for Congress. Cassidy has done well for his constituency and the State, but Woodburn can do fully as well or better, and Cassidy is not as popular or strong as he was two years ago. The chances are in favor of Woodburn, warming his jacket pretty effectually, and inducing him to stay at home. Cassidy can afford to rest on his well earned laurels for awhile, and ""may-be-so"" he may succeed Uncle Jimmy Fair to the United States Senate a couple of years from now.</p><p>LEGISLATIVE.</p><p>As before remarked, much more depends upon the judicious selection of men for the Legislature at Carson this time than is generally considered. The election of a United States Senator to succeed Jones is of course important, but beyond this comes very serious propositions of paramount interest to the already over-burthened taxpayers, principal of which is the reduction of the regular grain upon the State Treasury, and the more economical administration of State and county government. The number of officers can be reduced, deputies and other luxuries dispensed with, the county and judicial systems condensed, and the sails of the State properly timed to meet the dilapidating breezes of adversity at present prevailing and likely to continue. Another vexed and much discussed question, is regarding the advisability of a Constitutional Convention to get up a revision or regeneration of the State Constitution. There is no doubt that it needs it badly, but whether biennial legislative tinkerings by novices is better than giving the job to the best men that can be selected for that special and important duty, is a problem to be carefully considered, argued upon and properly solved. Past experience has shown the average Nevada legislator to be capable of not much beyond, 1st -- Looking out for his mileage and salary; 2d -- Electing United States Senator; 3d -- Hatching out various bills and dead failures for the regulation of the railroads; 4th -- Passing scrub relief bills for the mutual relief of both legislator and applicant; 5th -- Studying how not to reduce any running expenses, State or otherwise, and 6th -- Laboriously and anxiously figuring how to fill out the session to its full limit and last minute. If the State House roof needs repairing, remodeling or rebuilding by all means employ the best mechanics adapted for that particular purpose, and not Jacks of all trades, which are traditionally considered to be good at none. It may cost more at first, but will be cheapest in the end. Having expressed these same ideas editorially on the same subject three or four years ago, I can claim the jewel of consistency, if nothing else.</p><p>POLITICAL EVANGELIST.</p><p>The temperance gospel, according to St. John, seems to be obtaining considerable weight in the minds of people throughout the east, and even extends to the wicked Pacific Coast. Many a whisky-hardened old sinner has wished for a time of deliverance from the chains that bound him, and is willing to rise and follow the red cross standard of St. John for his own personal benefit and salvation. But what total destruction to the Democratic party! Republicans some times take a little good whisky, when their seductive Democratic brethren invite them, of course. St. John advises that all whisky be not drank at all, but quietly left in the drug stores, but for what particular purpose he does not say. But what an idea! The drug stores would be worse overloaded with whisky in seven days than the United States Treasury has been with silver coinage in seven years. Yet thousands of suffering wives and families throughout the Nation would bless St. John, nevertheless.</p><p>REESE RIVER RIPPLES.</p><p>A new whisky mill has opened, or a closed one revived, within the last day or two, for the especial benefit of all candidates, traveling speakers, and those engaged in the active work of the campaign. And yet many of the saloon men complain of hard times.</p><p>Our local military company, the National Guard, has reorganized lately, and will shortly bloom out with doubled numbers, a new Captain and other invigorating circumstances. The brass band of sixteen pieces connected with it cannot be beaten and perhaps equaled in the State.</p><p>A party of county officials went out in the country ""fishing,"" they said, the other day, but they brought no fish. They said they fried and ate all as fast as they caught them. Many politicians go a fishing nowadays.</p><p>Catarrh is plenty, now, most anywhere, and lot of people are afflicted with the wearisome complaint without fishing for it. The recent frosts did injure the late wheat crop some, especially that portion of the grain that had fallen down or ""lodged,"" but the present good weather brings most of it out all right, and the crop will be better than average.</p><p>The Fall fights culminated the other evening with a very severe tussle in a variety store. He was drunk and disorderly and tried to beat the head of an innocent drum. The Chief of Police rushed in. There was a terrible struggle, participated in by bystanders, and a general tumbledown, with a United States official underneath, with his broad back on seventy-three pounds of ripe tomatoes. Every tomato was pressed flat and reduced to a flowing stream. The prisoner was taken to the calaboose, and the grand question is who pays for the tomatoes.</p><p>ALF.

TE63,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday October 5, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>The Democratic Convention -- Heavy and Unseasonable Snow Storm -- Congressman Cassidy -- How Judge Scott Got Caught Out -- Mill and Mining Matters -- A Satisfactory Piece of Machinery -- Old Ice -- Cowhide Cocktail -- Shoeing Cows -- Curfew -- Soreheads -- Etc.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, October 3, 1884</p><p>The Democratic County Convention, day before yesterday, brought a lively snow storm, which lasted until last evening, covering the whole country with a wintry blanket about four inches thick. Thus far we have had snow in every month in the year, sufficient to whiten the hillsides and mountain tops about here on each occasion. Last Winter was evidently a ""holdover.""</p><p>THAT CONVENTION.</p><p>The aforesaid convention of our Democratic friends was a model affair of its kind, and passed off very smoothly, James B. Eagan, Chairman, presiding like an old veteran, although he is a young man and this was his first attempt. There were many amusing incidents, such as forty-two votes being cast on the very first ballot, when there were only thirty-nine members. Four nominations were made for the three Assemblymen to be chosen, and a motion was carried to vote for each one separately. It took considerable argument to show that this could not well be done, when the motion was withdrawn, without reconsideration. For County Commissioner one ambitious delegate scattered his ballot by putting the names of all three candidates upon it. Our worthy County Assessor, trusting in the legality of the bill passed by the last Legislature, enabling all County Assessors to hold their offices two years longer than they were elected for, felt serene, and made no fight until the decision of the Supreme Court was telegraphically received, declaring the bill unconstitutional. Then he sailed in and got badly defeated in the convention. He probably saves money by it, however, as all the nominations of this convention, with, perhaps, two or three exceptions, are destined to be beaten at the November election. At the conclusion, three cheers were given for Cleveland and Hendricks, and all hands hilariously broke for the nearest saloons without waiting for any formal sine die adjournment. The chair is in doubt as to whether the convention has taken a general recess or a two years' vacation. All these harmless little irregularities merely gave the spice of variety to the occasion, and perhaps the Republican Convention to-morrow, may be similarly flavored.</p><p>CASSIDY.</p><p>The first heavy artillery of the campaign was fired last Saturday evening, when Congressman Cassidy addressed the population of Austin, giving his views of the political situation, and rendering an account of his stewardship. Bonfires blazed, cannon roared, and martial music swelled forth upon the cool evening air. The spacious court-room was crowded and quite a number of ladies were present. In a two hours' speech of fervid eloquence, our portly, handsome George vindicated himself and his course admirably, discussed the tariff, which, if intended for revenue, he said, should not be placed so high as to prevent importation, or there would be no revenue. He portrayed and represented Cleveland as one of the grandest, ablest, men of the present age, and proved to the satisfaction of all who knew no better, that all the past and present prosperity of this great American nation was due solely to the noble, pure and incorruptible old Democratic party. George is a man of fine presence, positive remarks, and bold, unblushing assertions.</p><p>CAUGHT OUT.</p><p>Among the most frequent visitors to Austin from Battle Mountain, especially during the sessions of the District Court, is Judge E.A. Scott, the veteran journalist. He tells a very good story on himself -- how he got caught out once. It was about nineteen years ago, and he was traveling one night over the New York and Erie Railroad. The train stopped at a station in the town of Binghampton, and he was awakened by a terrible row on the platform of the depot. He sprang out of his berth with nothing but his shirt, drawers and socks on, and rushed to see the fray. Two men were having a desperate and bloody rough and tumble fight, amid a wildly-excited crowd, and sundry policemen were trying to press in to the rescue. Scott got as badly excited as anybody, and joined in the surging mass. Just then the bell rang and the train started. He managed to get out of the crowd and rushed for the cars, but he was too late , and found himself left. Worse than that, the fight was over, and he found himself in the hands of the police and several angry persons, all asking what he had to do with the fight. ""Nothing,"" said he. ""Then what the devil are you stripped for?"" He had a hard time explaining and making them believe, and they held possession of him six hours, till he telegraphed ahead to the next station, intercepting the train, and had his clothes and baggage sent back to him, after which he was permitted to go on.</p><p>MILL AND MINING MATTERS.</p><p>The Manhattan mill has started up again after a couple of weeks rest for much needed repairs to the roasting furnace and sundry improvements to the machinery. There is plenty of rich ore in the ore houses and in sight in the mine to keep the mill running for an indefinite length of time. The big Comstock plunger pump at the Frost shaft, of which I have heretofore made mention, has been running regularly ever since it first started, nearly three months ago, and does even better service than was expected of it. The pump, as stated, was from the Sierra Nevada mine and the bob from the Woodville, Lower Gold Hill. Having better foundations and being set up far better than it was originally, that ponderous bob works very much smoother and more perfectly than it ever did before; in fact the whole arrangement constitutes a very effective, economical and thoroughly satisfactory piece of machinery. Near the huge tank or reservoir into which this pump discharges, a powerful steam pump has recently been located for the purpose of forcing the water to the hoisting works of the neighboring mines, and also supplying the hydrants about the new and extensive buildings erected at the Frost shaft, giving prompt and effective protection in case of fire.</p><p>INCIDENTALS.</p><p>The present cold snap is discouraging and unprofitable to ice-dealers. Joaquin Patargo, who hauls Reese river to town every season and peddles it out in a frozen state, has ice in his storehouse over three years old. It keeps first-rate, not even getting mouldy or wormy.</p><p>A good-looking young lady the other morning stepped into a saloon and struck the barkeeper across the face with a cowhide, remarking: ""I'll learn you how to talk about me. I'm too good for you to talk about."" Then she left him, wondering what it was all about. The cowhide only made a little welt or dent across the corner of his eye, so he considered it a case of mistaken identity, until he could make further inquiries. Anyhow, he don't like that style of lick-er.</p><p>A few days ago, at Watson & Williams' blacksmith shop, I observed a small herd of cows being shod. They were young animals, of fine breed, and being driven from Salt Lake Valley to California. Their feet became worn and tender, so that shoeing became a necessity.</p><p>The curfew bell ringing at 8 o'clock every evening, still works to a charm, sending all the little boys home at the proper time. And everybody counts to see that Chief of Police King doesn't miss a stroke. There being so many candidates in the field for the various county offices, numerous sore-heads naturally resulted from the Democratic Convention, and many more will result from the Republican Convention to-morrow. Political buzzing is the chief feature among the general public just now.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE63.jpg,territorial

Ward Beecher -- Campaign Speakers -- Ore and Bullion -- Military -- Third Party -- Matrimonial Coaching -- Nuts and Blankets -- Grand Coon Dog Ball -- County Consolidation.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise]</p><p>AUSTIN, October 10, 1884</p><p>The wild, whirling cloudburst of politics at present convulsing Eastern Nevada, has descended upon Austin like a cyclone on a millpond, and the consequent disturbance among both big and little fish is demoralizing to contemplate. The crowning culmination was the Republican County Convention of Saturday, placing both sets of political nominees squarely before the public. And now the buzzy candidate flitteth from knot to knot of his friends along the sidewalks and street corners, and the expectant saloonkeeper gleefully rubbeth his hands as he contemplates possible movements in his direction. He complaineth, however, of too much talk and too little beer, and draweth invidious comparisons between this and far more lucrative campaigns in the regretted past.</p><p>ON THE RACK.</p><p>Truth to speak, it were better for the contracted purses of the various candidates that these conventions had been held a week or two later. The successful nominees on both tickets, jealously watchful of their opponents in the contest for popularity and influence among the voters, recklessly spend their coveted official fees in advance, and the defeated aspirants serenely stand in at the bar and help deplete their borrowed treasures, philosophically remarking: ""Go in you galled jades, our withers are unwrung."" Success in the nomination is a tribulative, uncertain quantity at the best, and especially where the political parties are so unevenly divided as they are in Lander county. Many a troubled candidate ardently wishes now that he could sleep beneath the waters of oblivion till the 5th of November and then wake up elected.</p><p>SOREHEADS.</p><p>Conventions without resultant soreheads are not common in the State of Nevada, not even in Lander, the ""mother of counties,"" and the soreheads here, as well everywhere else, look back retrospectively, and see and tell just how they got beaten, and what beat them. But the most fruitful source of soreheadedness is the having to continually explain the how, why and wherefore. If sympathizing friends or hypocritical interviewers would let them alone, as they come out of the fight with lacerated craniums and trailing tail feathers, they would not feel half so sore. We can all see further behind than we can ahead. One poor unfortunate deliberately went into one of the conventions, with the full slate of that convention in his starboard breast pocket, knowing that he was to be slaughtered. He put up his little $5 to learn something, learned it, captured all the votes outside of the slate, and came out defeated a little, yet not crushed nor soreheaded.</p><p>""He who fights and runs away,</p><p>May live to fight another day.""</p><p>Sometimes it is good for a man to try his popularity in this way, to ""drop on himself,"" as it were, and find out his definite status in the opinion of his fellow men. As Bobby Burns so aptly and suggestively remarks:</p><p>""O, wad some power the giftie gie us</p><p>To see oursels as ithers see us!</p><p>It would frae mony a blunder free us,</p><p>And foolish notion.""</p><p>INDEPENDENTS.</p><p>Independent candidates who announce themselves after the convention, are naturally classed among the soreheads, and are equally to be feared. The sorehead naturally tries to get even by slyly coppering sundry portions of the ticket, and influencing his sympathizing friends to do the same. The Independent candidate, however, may have for his only motive the defeat of some individual whom he deems to have been unjustly preferred to him by the slate-makers, and he concentrates his efforts to that one point. In a county where a quiet combination of less than a hundred voters can ""horse"" either party and sway the election as they please, Independent candidates are powerful and have been successful. The only safety with the regular troops is to stand shoulder to shoulder, soothe the soreheads as much as possible, and vote the ticket straight. ""All's well that ends well."" These remarks are not intended to apply in this section any more than to the Comstock and the rest of the State.</p><p>COON DOGS.</p><p>In making up a party ticket blunders are too apt to be made in considering the political availability of individuals, and social preference instead of real merit and popular strength. The idea that a man must be good for a legislator, Superintendent of Schools, or other officer, etc., merely because he is available and thought to be strong, is the old coon dog style of argument: ""H--ll on coons, is he?"" ""Well, I guess so; don't know."" ""Then what makes you call him a coon dog?"" "" 'Cause he ain't worth a damn for anything else."" The chances are that the coon dogs in this fight will be among the corpses found on the field, after the battle in November.</p><p>OUR CONVENTION.</p><p>The Republican County Convention last Saturday bore a singular resemblance in some of its features to that of the Democracy a week previously. A. Nicholls was Chairman, and everything passed off as smoothly as though cut, dried and greased beforehand, occupying only four hours' time, most of the nominations being made by acclamation. The order of business was the same, and it started off exactly like the Democratic Convention, forty two votes being cast on the very first ballot, when there were but thirty-nine members. Some weak, injudicious nominations were made, but, on the whole, the ticket is stronger than that of the Democracy. Those coming under the head of ""coon dogs,"" on either ticket, and destined to be slain in the November battle, can thank the injudicious management, as well as their own personal unfitness, weakness, and unpopularity, and not attribute their defeat to the superior strength and generalship of their opponents.</p><p>AT-CHOO !</p><p>September seems to be the favorite month for catarrh, hay-fever and universal sneezing. Anyhow Henry Ward Beecher has his annual attack of that disease in September, and many people in this section as well as in the East are now, like him, rapidly recovering from it. A New York correspondent of the New Haven Register, writing under date of September 16, says:</p><p>Beecher is so afflicted just now with hay-fever that I doubt if he cares whether we ever have another President. Although a certificate signed by him, and declaring that a certain medicine is a sure cure for that disease, is current in the advertisements, he is having his annual spell of it. His nose is the reddest I ever saw, and his sufferings are so acute that it might be dangerous to ask him why he didn't take the dose which he lauded.</p><p>Beecher has tried to escape the impending calamity by going to the White Mountains and other resorts in September, yet he has not been very successful. Uncle Henry may dodge female blandishments, conviction and tophet, but he can't dodge the hay-fever.</p><p>ANTICIPATION.</p><p>And now we are all looking ahead in hopeful anticipation of the promised visits of campaign speakers to this section -- Woodburn, Jones, Daggett and others. Jones promised to come here two years ago, when he was at Eureka, but disappointed us through inability to connect. He has a host of friends and admirers here who would like to see him and hear him expound some of the leading texts in the political gospel as only he can do it.</p><p>VARIETIES.</p><p>The Manhattan mill is steadily smashing rich ore and turning out plenty of bullion as usual. There is ore enough in sight and available to keep it running till New Years. Meanwhile further developments in the mines may furnish material to keep it running for an indefinite period.</p><p>Our local military company, the National Guard, will, as mentioned in my last, effect its reorganization next Sunday with a very largely-increased membership and Melville Curtis is the new Captain.</p><p>The formation of a third, or Independent party, composed of both Republicans and Democrats, dissatisfied with the result of the recent county conventions, has been quietly discussed the last few days, but the movement has not taken tangible form as yet.</p><p>The homeliest woman in Austin has, for the last twenty years, been spoiling for a husband. She has at last concluded to buy her a coach, but the only trouble now is to secure a suitable coachman.</p><p>The pine nut harvest has been extraordinarily good this season, the nuts being unusually large and plentiful. And the thrifty Piute sells his nuts for coin, and takes more interest in flaming red and yellow blankets than he does in politics.</p><p>A grand ball is advertised in the Reveille of candidates nominated at the recent county conventions of both parties, to take place at International Hall next Tuesday night. No outside invitations are extended, therefore we must infer that they do their own dancing and pay their own fiddler. But the grand coon dog ball, to be given on the night of November 5, composed of defeated candidates, slaughtered aspirants, kickers, independents and soured politicians generally, will totally eclipse anything of the season. Music by the Salt River Codfish band. Admission and exit free, with coon dog cocktails thrown in.</p><p>The ENTERPRISE idea of the consolidation of Washoe, Storey, Ormsby and Lyon into one county is good enough, but too extensive for sudden adoption. Storey should merge into Washoe, and Lyon and Douglas into Ormsby, thus forming two convenient-sized counties to very good advantage. Reno and Carson would then each be a boss county seat, of equalized importance and increased prosperity -- and with trebly increased mutual jealousy.</p><p>ALF.

TE65,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday  October 26, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Congressman Woodburn's Popular Reception and Address in Austin -- Lander Hill Aglow with Republican Enthusiasm -- Bonfires, Cannon and a Torchlight Procession on Wheels -- About the Public Land Donations -- The Senator Jones Standard -- Anxious Candidates -- Smiling Voters -- Salt River -- Coon Dogs -- A Bad ""Pitch.""</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, October 24, 1884</p><p>Again were the patriotic echoes of the old Toiyabe range awakened on Monday evening last by a grand Republican demonstration, similar to that of the Saturday evening previous in honor of Senator Jones. This time it was Hon. William Woodburn, about to be re-elected to Congress from Nevada in place of Cassidy, who was the proud recipient of festive Austin honors and hospitalities. About 7 P.M. the torchlight procession and brass band, on a long train of flat-cars, handled by the street locomotive, Mule's Relief, moved slowly down the street, the numerous torches, huge flaming beacons and lettered transparencies giving it the appearance of an extensive load of seething fire. The cheers of the procession were heartily responded to by the crowds densely lining the sidewalks, and the martial music was rythmetically punctuated, as it were, by the frequent fierce reports of the loudmouthed little brass cannon on the street, near the lofty blazing bonfire. Woodburn had arrived on the train of the previous evening, visited the mines and mill in the forenoon, shook hands with most of the population, including numerous friends and old acquaintances, and was feeling first-rate. He appreciated the novel style of his reception and genuine heartiness very much. International Hall was densely crowded, the front seats being filled with ladies, and the brass band imparted the influence of choice, inspiring music. Chairman Andrew Nicholls, of the County Central Committee, introduced Mr. Woodburn to the audience, and he was received with demonstrative approval. He spoke fully two hours, and his attentive audience frequently interrupted him with appreciative applause. He was placed somewhat at a disadvantage by Jones having preceded him so recently, covering many points of his discourse. Moreover, his subject matter was largely made up of replies to Cassidy's bold, recklessly mendacious assertions, which must not be allowed to go unrefuted or unexposed, and which constitutes no small or easy task. The following is merely a brief sketch or summary of</p><p>MR. WOODBURN'S DISCOURSE.</p><p>Referring to Cassidy's bold claim to having not only his own party's vote, but also many Republican votes, he said: ""I feel a little more modest, and shall only ask for the votes of the Republicans. So, too, as he claims to show up advantageously the Democratic side of this great political argument, I will show up t he Republican side. I also propose to show him up, tell my own story and let the people judge between us. He cites the McSweeney case, to show that our Republican Administration does not protect the rights of adopted or naturalized citizens, yet the record shows that McSweeney had renounced his American citizenship, returned to Ireland, became again an English subject, and was holding as office as such; therefore, was not entitled to any protection or influence on our part. The Kostza case was very different. Austrian officers attempted to kidnap him, in Smyrna, a neutral Turkish port, claiming him as an Austrian and liable to military duty. He called for protection as an American citizen, and Captain Ingraham promptly opened the ports of his war ship and compelled them to release their prisoner and took him under the protection of the stars and stripes. And it was James G. Blaine who called special attention of Congress to this matter, and caused an Act to be passed declaring that a certificate of American naturalization must be properly respected by all nations. Granting to foreigners, whether naturalized or not, who served in our army, 160 acres of land, the Homestead law, the Eight-hour law were all Republican, and not Democratic measures. Cassidy, with the most willful persistency, still states that the Democratic party has never given away one inch of the public domain to aid in building railroads and canals, when the official records show that during the ten years from 1850 to 1860 the Democratic administration did give away no less that 33,680,000 acres for that very purpose. He tries to blame the Republican party for only acquiring Alaska, and not Louisiana, which was acquired many years before the Republican party or even Cassidy was born. No Democrat has ever originated a law to exclude or restrict Chinese immigration. Cassidy ungenerously gives no credit whatever to Senator Jones on the silver question, but to Bland, who had no more to do with its origin than the man in the moon. Yet everybody knows Jones originated, promoted and engineered the Silver bill to final success, remonetizing silver and restoring to it its value and usefulness as a legal coin of the Nation. Dick Bland lived on the Comstock in 1866 and had his headquarters in Judge Pitzer's office. He had leanings toward law, and the height of his ambition was to run for Justice of the Peace. He got defeated, subsided and finally disappeared. He subsequently turned up in Congress, and was put on the Committee on Mines and Mining, being probably considered as a Comstock ""expert."" Banks drew up a Silver bill by way of experiment, and it was referred to the Mines and Mining Committee, who approved it, and Bland had the honor of lying it on the Clerk's desk. This gave it his name, and made him unexpectedly famous. It has kept him in Congress ever since, and it is a wonder that it has not elevated him to the Presidential chair. James G. Blaine was a friend of our silver and did all he could for us, as he also did in the Chinese restriction matter. Cassidy's tariff ideas are too limited and muddled for all practical purposes, -- uncertain and shaky as the tariff plank in the Democratic platform. Cleveland is the representative of free trade, and all the free traders in the country have arrayed themselves under his banner. Cassidy says a County Commissioner is good enough for a President. I don't mind his applying that proposition to his candidate, but not to ours. He also declares that there is too much corruption in Government affairs, anyhow, and thinks a change would be beneficial. I , too, want a change. I want Cassidy put out, and myself put in his place. He says we have no navy, yet what has our Democratic Congress done toward providing one. He claims to have secured the passage of an appropriation of $25,000 for the improvement of the Colorado river, yet it will be borne in mind that when the bill was being considered, Cassidy deliberately rose and said Nevada needed no such appropriation, for she had no river bigger than the stream flowing from the Sutro tunnel. He claims that his bill for $200,000, in liquidation of the Indian war debt passed, but the record shows that it did not. He got $12,000 appropriated for the removal of the remains of deceased soldiers from Fort Churchill, and has distributed barrels of seeds and bushels of documents throughout the State, yet he should not claim credit for doing the simple duty that he was elected, sent there and paid for doing. The Desert Land bill did not originate with Cassidy, but with Uncle Johnny Boland, down at Rye Patch. The meeting adjourned with cheers for Blaine and Logan, and for Woodburn. He left for Belmont next morning, addressed a large and enthusiastic audience there Wednesday evening, returned yesterday to Austin and left again this morning, to speak in Reno to-morrow evening. Woodburn is doing some very arduous and effective work in the good cause, and he will deserve his reward at the polls a week from next Tuesday. Cassidy, the man of bold, reckless assertions, should be glad of a chance to rest and recuperate his conscience.</p><p>A PAYING POLICY.</p><p>Among the numerous campaign documents distributed by the Democracy is a map showing the public lands that have been given away in aid of the construction of railroads and canals throughout the United States. The Democracy desires to thus show up Republican extravagance and venal wastefulness in that respect, totally ignoring the fact that this policy was commenced very liberally under Democratic rule and administration. And yet where is the detriment or loss in so doing? Is it not good policy? Has it not proven to be so? Building railroads through any country and any lands -- good, bad or indifferent -- infallibly increases the value of such lands, or gives a tangible value they never possessed before. Millions of acres given to the Central Pacific Railroad were totally and absolutely valueless until the road was built across the continent. Now the alternate sections reserved by Government are worth ten times more than all the sections ever were before. ""Half a loaf is much better than no bread."" The broad dark streaks on that map merely show improvement and prosperity, and form a most excellent argument in favor of Republican rule and progress. Even owners of valuable town sites or lots find it good paying policy to give away numerous lots to persons who will build upon and make substantial improvements, thereby far more than doubling the value of the rest of the property.</p><p>SENATOR JONES.</p><p>The recent visit of Senator Jones to Eastern Nevada was like a broad ray of warm sunshine beaming diagonally across the political horizon. He had a jolly smile for all, and all hands willingly smiled with him, regardless of political complexion. The Eureka folks declare that he is the best speaker, giving the best political address ever heard in that furnace-fumed burg. The Austin people all swear by Jones, and the old pioneers unhesitatingly declare that nothing like him has been here before or since the flood. They consider him a walking text book on tariff, currency or anything else in that line -- a single standard of forensic eloquence, by which all other speakers have to be comparatively judged and valued hereafter. It will be ""Yes, he's a mighty good talker, but you oughter heerd Jones."" Those who couldn't squeeze into the hall or get far enough up the stairway to hear his voice are regarded as unfortunate. Colonel A.C. Ellis, of Carson, is to be here next Monday evening and talk Democracy. Even now many are asking what sort of a talker he is as compared with Jones. If he falls too far below the standard he will be mobbed.</p><p>TAILINGS.</p><p>Strong delegations of candidates from both parties have gone down to Battle Mountain and the north end of the county electioneering. One stands the other off in the way of securing votes or influence, and the friendly voter smileth with either party when called upon.</p><p>Jones found one freshly-naturalized citizen here named John P. Jones, just like himself. He also found about forty other Jones's, all good men, and all Republicans.</p><p>The Salt River boat is being got ready for passengers, and the coon-dog ball on November 5 is sure to be the grandest success of the season. Many an anxious candidate is in a state of trepidation lest he should be proved to be a coon-dog. Some are already picked out as such.</p><p>The other evening ""Red Jimmy"" Williams, speaking politically, cocked his head over one side, as he sagaciously remarked, ""It's my opinion, old son, that the Democratic party's workin' on tribute, and they's got a dam pad pitch.""       </p><p>ALF.

TE66,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday November 2, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Colonel A.C. Ellis Enlightens the Austin Political Horizon -- He Talks Two Hours Without Serious Detriment -- Silver, Tariff, Chinese and Mcsweeney -- The Coon-Dog Ball and Supper -- Not Registered -- Cranky Notions -- Dry Compliments -- The Next Circus</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, October 30, 1884</p><p>The political discourse of Colonel A.C. Ellis, on Monday Evening, was the latest sensation in that line. The Austin Democracy were out in full force, had two grand bonfires on Main street, and the little brass cannon banging away fiercely, making more noise than a whole park of artillery in war time. The National Guard Band did the music for the occasion in excellent style, and, although there was no procession, the street looked hilariously lively. International Hall was crowded to its utmost capacity, a large number of ladies being present, and numerous Republicans helping to make up the audience. The stage was adorned with green bushes, and, with the band in full uniform, presented a pleasing appearance. Hon. H. T. Creswell, Chairman of the Democratic County Central Committee, introduced Colonel Ellis to the audience, and he made a good lively address for a little over two hours. His good voice and delivery and general pleasing style impressed his audience very favorably, and he was frequently applauded. He spoke rapidly and talked more in two hours than many can in four. The following is a condensed reference to the principal points of his discourse:</p><p>COLONEL ELLIS' SPEECH.</p><p>He commenced by saying it was ten years ago that he first had the honor to address a meeting of citizens of Lander County in this very hall. At that time he was politically asking something for himself, but on this present occasion he only appeared in behalf of the Democratic ticket generally, and the national nominees, and neither should he resort to the repetition of those foul slanders regarding the private and domestic characters of the leading candidates on either ticket, which had already formed too much of the stock in the present campaign. He proposed to consider the respective candidates from the standpoint of their true merit and comparative qualifications. So, also, he should present and discuss the motives, acts, and national trend or drift of each party, and judging the present and future by the past, show which party was the best entitled to public confidence and support. This was a promisingly fair and candid starting out on the part of the talented speaker, but he seemed to forget all about it before he got half through, and constituted himself a special pleader in behalf of the Democratic party and its nominees. He saw nothing but usurpation, barefaced dishonesty and arrogant corruption on the part of the Republicans; while the Democracy shone forth as a model of patient, guileless innocence, and longsuffering, down-trodden ambition, whose sole desire was to once more get on deck and rescue the country from the chaos of ruin and disrepute into which it was plunged by the venal, destructive machinations of the willfully, selfishly corrupt party now in power. If he saw or knew of any good deeds by the Republican party, he did not apparently deem them worthy of mention, but claimed all good acts, deeds and intentions for the Democracy. In short, he distorted facts, and was not candidly honest in his charges and illustrations, freely laying himself open to criticism in that respect at various points. In the matter of bold, reckless assertions, he was almost equal to Cassidy, and could not fail to show that he was a genuine, consistent old dyed-in-the-wool Bourbon Democrat.</p><p>The first great burningly important measure which concerns the whole nation, and especially Lander county, said he, is called the silver question. You all remember how, like a thief in the night, silver was demonetized in 1873 at the hands of the Republican party. They had the Presidency, House, Senate and all departments of Government, therefore that party alone is responsible for that great wrong to our mining and business interests throughout the country. There was no relief from the consequent deep and disastrous depression until under beneficent Democratic rule silver was remonetized in 1878, and prosperity once more smiled throughout the land. A Democrat, of whom Mr. Woodburn has told you, formerly lived on the Comstock and whose highest ambition was to be a Justice of the Peace -- which was no criterion to judge of him detrimentally, for even Jefferson and others of our leading statesmen had similar aspirations -- this gentleman introduced a bill before Congress providing for the coinage of the silver dollar of 412 ½ grains and also for the free coinage of silver, on the same principle or privilege as that of gold. This part was stricken out by the Republicans, and among those voting against it was Mr. Blaine. He favored and advocated a dollar of 430 grains, which would debase silver still more in value, and be ruinous to our great Western silver mining interests. Colonel Ellis read the Bland bill, including the rejected free coinage provision, and went on to state that after it passed with a provision authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 of silver per month to be coined into the standard dollar of 412 ½  grains each, that Republican official, in the interest of those unfriendly to silver, always, from that day to this, has adhered to the minimum amount, and never purchased more than the $2,000,000 per month. Colonel Ellis says Blaine opposed and voted against the Bland bill, and was the enemy of silver, but the record shows very differently. Colonel Ellis also very deliberately ignored our ""Silver Senator,"" Jones, entirely in the matter of giving him no credit whatever for his herculean efforts in the solution of the great silver problem. Yet the whole financial world knows that to Senator Jones are we principally indebted for the remonetization of silver, and the restoration of our silver dollars.</p><p>The Colonel, of course, claimed all honor for the Democratic party in the disposal of the Chinese question, that the Democratic party had fought that battle in many campaigns, and finally won it. He neglected to mention that they had any assistance from the Republicans of the Pacific Coast, but stated that only three Republicans east of the Rocky Mountains voted for the Restriction bill which is now rules. He neglected also to state that the Chinese came to the Pacific Coast in the early days of California by the direct invitation and under the fostering care and protection of the Democratic party. Democrats and Chinamen affiliated very well in those days, and would yet if the Chinese had been shrewd enough or cared to become citizens, and thus placed themselves on voting equality. All old timers will remember how the ""China boys,"" with their little red button skull-caps, baggy-seated breeches and long tails, accompanied by their truly devilish band of music, were given an honorary position in public processions in California, and how old John Bigler, the Democratic Governor of California, presided at Chinese banquets until he naturally received the humorous soubriquet of ""Mandarin John."" It was not until the Republicans came into power that the Democrats discovered that their voteless Celestial brethren were all long-tailed curses of the first water.</p><p>The speaker compared the platforms of the two political parties, and showed how recklessly the Republican party has been giving away the public lands to railroads, canals, and foreigners, by millions upon millions of acres, during its reign of terror, yet omitted to mention the numerous millions of acres similarly given away by the Democracy, to say nothing of several entire States and other Government property before the Republican party came into power.</p><p>Next came the tariff. Daggett, sitting by a purling brook beneath the lovely banana trees of Honolulu, had read the platform of the Democratic party on that knotty problem in American politics, and couldn't make out what it meant, and he (the Colonel) was free to remark that the tariff planks of both parties are so worded that no living soul can understand them. He spoke of the enormous revenue which had caused $400,000,000 to accumulate as dead property in the Treasury, with $130,000,000 more surplus still coming in every year, all of no use to anybody, unless we ""rake her,"" and yet the heavy burden of taxation goes on all the same. The Colonel was not posted, or willfully omitted to state that the great majority of that large accumulation is contingently appropriated, and in reality there is but $70,000,000 surplus in the Treasury. Moreover, if Cleveland is to be elected, and the Democracy once more to take command, which he says is sure to be next Tuesday, what objection can any hungry Democrat have to a fat Treasury, worth ""raking?"" As a matter of prudent provision against possible future trouble, surely a snug little home bank account of $500,000,000 in ready money is a good thing to have. When the Republicans came into power they found the whole country going to ruin and wholesale Democratic destruction, with the national. credit broken and the Treasury empty -- the Democracy had ""raked"" her clean. The Colonel did not claim to be a free trader, and said no statesman was, yet the more he discussed and argued this matter, the more he showed himself against a protective tariff. He attributed our lack of shipping, lack of employment in some of the manufacturing centers, and even the disadvantages of labor in the struggle with capital, to the protective tariff, which helps the monopolist far more than it protects the wages of labor and helps the poor man. He argued against labor-saving machinery, as throwing labor out of employment, saying by way of illustration, that two men, and two children, with their ingenious pin three machine make enough pins to supply three Nevadas. If such be the fact, how many hundreds or thousands of such machines will it take to supply the whole United States? He denied that the wool-growers are injured by the reduction of the tariff on wool. The reduction was only half a cent a pound, yet wool had declined ten cents.</p><p>He reviewed the respective records of Blaine and Cleveland, to the decided disadvantage of Blaine, of course. Blaine had taken advantage of his public position to benefit himself financially and otherwise. The chances are that the Colonel or any other level-headed man would do the same thing. Most public men do. The Mulligan letters he cited as showing how unfortunate Blaine was in his correspondence, yet the Colonel failed to show anything very culpable about them. Great cry and little wool -- not enough to wool the eyes of the average American voter.</p><p>Speaking of the McSweeney case, he said McSweeney was a naturalized American citizen, for several years in San Francisco, went back to Ireland, was put in prison, claimed protection from the American Republican government and it was refused. He saw McSweeney recently in New York and asked him about it. Mac stated that he never knew why he was imprisoned; didn't do anything, and was arrested, that's all he knew. Now the Colonel is smart lawyer enough to know that this is an unfair statement of the case; that McSweeney renounced his American citizenship, became an English subject, and was holding an office as such when he was arrested for seditious language, all of which however the Colonel omitted to state. He was equally infelicitous in his reference to the Kositza case.</p><p>The Colonel wound up his long and eloquent harangue with a brief review of the highly auspicious outlook of the present campaign for the Democratic party. The returns from Ohio indicated that it would go Democratic on the 4th of November. The great demonstrations in New York showed that it will go the Democratic ticket. New Jersey, Indiana and the Pacific States will fall into line, and on the 4th of November Providence will be in favor of the Democratic party in the national councils and throughout the whole county.</p><p>Three cheers were given for Cleveland and Hendricks, and the band played ""Dixie."" Then by way of apology, as it were, it played the Star Spangled Banner and Yankee Doodle, as the crowded assemblage filed out of the hall.</p><p>Taken as a whole, this political discourse of Colonel Ellis has no weighty effect. As a lively, interesting talk it did well enough, but even the Democrats did not believe more than half of it, and as the Republicans disbelieved the other half, the whole is repudiated. His argument was faulty, erratic and thin, therefore unsatisfactory, and did not carry conviction into the political souls of his hearers.</p><p>THE BALL.</p><p>The grand coon-dog ball next Wednesday night will most undoubtedly be one of the most interesting events of the season. As before remarked, admission free, and coon-dog cocktails thrown in. It cannot fail to be well attended, for all the defeated candidates will be there, and all their sympathizing and disappointed friends, as well as all those who promised to vote for them (and lied). Included in the programme of dances I notice the following: Scratched Ticket Schottische; Bread and Butter Waltz; Quadrille Cheat (with throw-off delegates in the center); Sorehead Lancers; Kickers' Galop; Grand Coon-Dog Supper March. The Salt River Quadrille Band will do the music for the occasion, free of charge, being in the constant employ of the time-honored and most liberally patronized hotel at the head of the blessed old river.</p><p>THE SUPPER.</p><p>This is also sure to be unanimously patronized, as it will be as free as the drinks. The music of the supper march will be the old familiar domestic aria and ditty of –</p><p>""Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard</p><p>to get her poor dog a bone.""</p><p>Included in the menu I notice the following appetizing dishes: Fresh shysters on the half-shell; grilled mutton-heads, with Cleveland & Hendricks' famous sauce; Logan cutlets, served Blaine or breaded; coon-dog fricassee, with Salt River dope on the side; all aboard pudding, grand party chorus:</p><p>""I want to be a coon-dog</p><p>And up Salt River go,"" etc.</p><p>TAILINGS.</p><p>I notice the newspapers keep saying that Uncle Jimmy Fair is to arrive in Nevada in time to vote. But I see by the Enterprise that he is not registered in Virginia City, where he claims his residence, therefore he can't vote even if he does arrive. A crank in your city also writes me the following information: ""The latest story here is that Mackay and Fair will both be here this week to work for Cassidy and Cleveland and Jones.""</p><p>After his speaking the other evening Colonel Ellis did not run the round of the saloons and give the boys a drink. There is no hope of his ever getting elected for anything after such conduct. Several old stiffs bucked badly over the cold-blooded idea.</p><p>Yesterday a Piute, gazing at the large and handsome, various-colored political posters stuck up all round town, asked me: ""Nudder circus come pooty soon, mebby so?"" ""Oh, yes! heapa biggy circus come next Tuesday. ""</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE66.jpg,territorial

On Monday came the marshaling of the forces and on Tuesday the grand battle at the polls. It is seldom that such a very lively interest is taken in any election, and the result was a very decided surprise to all who participated. Heretofore Lander county has gone Democratic by more or less of a majority, occasionally some Republican managing to squeeze into office through extra-ordinary personal popularity or shrewd manipulation, but this time it went sweepingly Republican. Austin polled about 700 votes, and county nearly 1,000. Woodburn, for Congress, received a fine Republican majority of 168 over Cassidy, and the highest was 233 for Public Administrator, 230 being the highest for Assemblyman. Only two Democratic candidates for county offices were elected- Joe Miller for County Clerk, and H.T. Creswell for District Attorney, with respective majorities of 107 and 94. Blaine's majority was 197.</p><p>LOCAL POLITICS.</p><p>Austin, with her 700 votes, being nearly three-fourth of the county in point of population and voters, here was the principal battle-ground, and some excellent work was done. An Anglo-American Club was formed in the last week of the campaign. It was a secret arrangement and consisted of 125 members, exclusively Cornish; Englishmen not being admitted. And they pledged themselves to vote the Republican ticket straight, from top to bottom. They went to the polls in squads of five, carrying their ballots folded in their hands, and each voter watched his fellow very closely, so there was no show for sly changing of tickets or similar humbuggery. So the great free American privilege was thus carefully guarded from corruption, and the plan succeeded admirably. Yet it did not prevent Joe Miller and Harry Creswell from being elected. It is an evident fact that these two very successful Democrats received a large number of Republican votes. There were big spur wheels, and wheels within weeels in the running of the political machinery, but everything ran as smoothly as could be wished. Many Democrats declare that a ""sack"" was used, but fail to show precisely how or where.</p><p>THE DEAD AND WOUNDED.</p><p>The number of politically dead ones as the result of this well-fought battle is very small; in fact, perhaps, none, and none were crippled badly except in purse. The soreheads and coon-dogs all try and take the gruel of defeat as philosophically as possible. Those beaten in the convention have a fraternal regard for these still more unfortunate ones who succeeded, only to fall on the field of battle -- to ""drop on themselves,"" as it were. And these poor victims of misplaced confidence in their own natural capability, political strength and personal popularity may now also reflectively apply unto themselves those consoling lines of Bobby Burns:</p><p>O wad some power the giftie gie us</p><p>To see ourselves as others see us!</p><p>It wad frae mony a blunder free us,</p><p>And foolish notion.</p><p>But there is a grain of satisfaction in the idea that some of those who look on and critically judge and who, perhaps, deliberately assisted in their defeat, may perhaps also have the vanity to place themselves before the public as candidates for political favor at some future day and give a chance to play for even. Yet, after all, it is not a good proposition to be brooding too long over real or fancied wrongs, and in a few weeks the bruises and sores of this last battle will heal of themselves if left along and unaggravated. The sooner the incidental acrimonies are settled and disposed of the better.</p><p>EFFECTIVE WORK.</p><p>The excellent results of Senator Jones' recent visit to this part of the State can now be plainly seen and appreciated. Never did an able and eloquent speaker logically, practically and comprehensively explain the important political topics of the campaign to more willing listeners and with better effect. He captured the reasoning powers of men, and the hearty, magnetic influence of his friendly presence inspired all with confidence in him wherever he went. Even many politically opposed to him yielded to his arguments and their own natural perceptions of right and wrong, and voted the Republican ticket when the proper time came. This most certainly is demonstrated in Lander and Eureka counties very satisfactorily by the magnificent and unexpected increase of Republican strength md effectiveness at the polls.</p><p>WIRED LIES.</p><p>If the lies that have been flashed over the continent during the last two or three days could be strung on the wires like dried apples, there would be enough to reach from here to New York, where most of the lies come from. At first Cleveland was triumphant, next it was Blaine, then both were mixed. And fresh lies and contradictions came from the West as well as the East, and the numerous parties who had their money bet on the general result, or any special contingency were kept in a wild fever of doubts and fears, and if this thing is kept up much longer there will be suicides, fighting, or fresh subjects for the State Insane Asylum. There are thousands of dollars bet on this election, and fresh bets are being made. The last telegram to-night said Blaine was a little in the lead in New York, but the chances are it will be Cleveland's turn in the morning.</p><p>OTHER LIES.</p><p>If the atmosphere would allow it, I believe Austin would speedily become the banner precinct for square out-and-out whole cloth lying. But the purity of the atmosphere, saturated with an overflow of natural truthfulness prevails, except during political campaigns. Everyone of the recent candidates got unmercifully lied about, and it became an actual relief from the oppressive weight of accumulated mendacity to be able to get off a few rascally lies, or hear some fresh lying inventions told on somebody else. Ananias would be perfectly at home here. Some of the defeated candidates have been so badly and wilfully lied about that they have about lost confidence in their own integrity. It will take months to clear up those sulphurous lies, and some of them never will.</p><p>TAILINGS.</p><p>The grand ball of the soreheads, kickers and coon-dogs, the night after the election, was crowded, and all hands smiled and danced as philosophically as possible under the circumstances. The only independent candidate, who didn't get votes enough to be hardly worth counting, was the liveliest dancer of the lot, and his pas seul, executed on a single string was the finest terpsichorean feature of the evening. They all boarded the Salt River boat in the morning, and ""went upward with the flood.""</p><p>The Manhattan mill grinds right straight along, and it grinds exceedingly fine. And the work in the mines goes ahead as usual, regardless of politics. Senator Jones found numerous old Comstock miners here to shake hands with, many of whom used to work in the Crown Point and Kentuck, under his superintendency.</p><p>Sam. Crescenzo, of the International Hotel, ran up his flag Wednesday morning in honor of Cleveland's victory. Then the telegraph said Blaine had the best of it, but before he could pull down his flag Cleveland was on top again. Then it was Blaine and next Cleveland, until Sam. quit trying to even average either side, and now swears he will keep the flag up till he finds what it is flying for. Sam. and his partner, Tony Gondolfo, both despise lying telegrams and liars generally.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN .</p>",public://territorial/TE67.jpg,territorial

November 16, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Austin's Grand Democratic Ratification -- Chinese Lanterns and Piute Bonfires -- Democratic Conundrums -- Local Eloquence -- More Trouble Threatened -- A Discolored American -- Honest Sentiments – The Democratic Raid on the Postoffices -- Civil Service Reform Needed -- Delilah St. John -- Ben Butler -- Local Incidentals.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, November 13, 1884.</p><p>The brilliant example set by the Democracy of the East and elsewhere, celebrating the grand success of Cleveland and Hendricks, fired up the emulative ambition of the Democrats of Austin to go and do likewise, so last Monday evening they celebrated in very good style, with the material assistance of their Republican brethren. They borrowed the Republican torches, cannon, cars, etc., and sailed in for a good time. Democratic places of business and residences had their windows illuminated with candles, and long rows of Chinese lanterns adorned the porches, while flags, little and big, fluttered everywhere, reminding one of old times in Gold Hill and Virginia. Bonfires blazed along Main street, and a big pile of sagebrush burning on the hillside south of town was much enjoyed by a large assemblage of Piute squaws, bucks and papooses, who huddled around it. The spunky little Republican cannon belched forth saltpetered thunder from its brazen throat, and the National Guard band of fourteen pieces -- all Republican – did up the music in fine style. About 7 o'clock hostilities commenced by the formation of the grand torchlight procession, and marched up town, the band, in full uniform, playing Dixie. Behind the band came quite a number of men carrying torches and transparencies, and escorting a crowd of small boys representing the young Democracy of the Toiyabe range, hurrahing for Cleveland and Hendricks as often as their small piping voices would allow.</p><p>ALL ABOARD.</p><p>They marched gallantly up Main street to Upper Austin and the Manhattan mill. There they boarded a train of flat cars, with more Democrats and Republicans, and the mill whistle loudly tooted as they went rolling carefully along down through town. There was much hurrahing, and the band played ""Dixie"" in a most inspiring manner. Why is it that this peculiar old negro minstrel ditty, adopted as the war tune of the Southern Confederacy, is the only tune considered sufficiently expressive of Democratic patriotism on this festive occasions? Perhaps it is in favored recognition of the Solid South as the true backing of the Democracy, yet one of the transparencies bore the legendary inscription of ""We know of no North, no South, no East, no West."" Another transparency asked ""What's the Matter with Cleveland and New York?"" -- a very pertinent and knotty conundrum, rather troublesome to solve. Still another transparency bore the perhaps prophetic motto: ""Blaine and Logan the Coming Men.""</p><p>THE EXERCISES.</p><p>The train of flats came to a halt in front of the International, and when the band rested from playing Dixie, Hon. H. T. Creswell being loudly called for, appeared on the balcony. A guard of honor stood on each side of him, holding a fancy canopy of flags and things over his head, like the representation of Joss in a Chinese temple, giving fine effect to his ponderously prophetic words. Said He: Our Republican adversaries tell us that we are a little too hasty and previous in thus celebrating the election of Cleveland and Hendricks, our proud Democratic standard bearers as President and Vice President of these United States, but I have investigated the matter and do not think so. After twenty-four years of starvation on the outside of the public crib, is it any wonder that we embrace the earliest moment to celebrate our hard-won success? No, we are not too fast. Cleveland and Hendricks are elected, and I predict that they will be inaugurated on the fourth of next March, and there will b a good and prosperous administration. Good night."" Prolonged cheers and applause rewarded him, and after some more Dixie by the band James Egan, a rising young Democrat with no small degree of oratorical talent and general ability, was called forth beneath the pagoda. He said: ""There is a great cry throughout the land for Cleveland and Hendricks. The whole nation joins in a grand hallelujah for Cleveland and Hendricks, and it is no wonder that the Democrats should, on this proud occasion, give a jubilee of praise to the God who made them. Republicanism is a thing of the past, as is also the political career of James G. Blaine."" Then he recited a very clever parody on the ""Burial of Sir John Moore,"" and retired amid the hilarious plaudits of his audience. Both Creswell and Egan got off many other good things and were bountifully applauded throughout. The band having performed their contract for the evening, marched off up street playing Hail Columbia and every patriotic piece they could think of to disinfect their horns of Dixie, washed out their mouths with lager, and the evening's jubilee came naturally to an end. The Democracy, however, threaten to give us a second jubilation Saturday evening if Cleveland is not counted out by that time.</p><p>AN ANOMALY.</p><p>The most outspoken, disloyal American in Austin is a colored man, or, as he claims, a ""nigger."" He says openly that he is a secessionist, that the South was right in every respect, and that he is just as much of a rebel as Jeff Davis or any other man of the Southern Confederacy ever was. When one considers that the terrible civil war between the North and the South was solely in behalf of the colored race, it is hard to realize that one of that race can give utterance to such ungrateful sentiments, and honest human charity can only suggest that he is not of sound mind. The other evening our friend Baudle, who is of a moralizing disposition and somewhat peculiar in his expressions, after hearing the aforesaid colored man express himself, waxed indignant and relieved his mind as follows: ""I can hardly believe that I hear my ears aright. Was it for such monstrosities as him that we all fought, bled and died among the malarious everglades of the Chickahominy and on the seething ramparts of Lookout Mountain? Send him to the sugar-cane morasses of the South, where he belongs, here to work' neath the broiling rays of the refulgent sun and the resounding blows of the slave-drivers' whip. He ignores not a damn who made him free, and deserves not the orgies of American liberty. Yet this colored man is educated and intelligent. Education is the foundation of all human liberty, but in his case language is inadequate to express my indignation at a damn fool negro who thus outrages and nullifies his own procreation in the eyes of all true Americans. Words totally fail.""</p><p>HUNGRY DEMOCRATS.</p><p>Already we hear the note of preparation throughout the land of the Democracy preparing to make a general raid after all the Federal offices, from Superintendent to internal revenue bung-starter, all in gleeful anticipation of the change to a Democratic Administration. Even in Austin half a dozen good old Democrats have already put in their applications for the appointment of Postmaster. And in anticipation of a change, anyhow, even if Cleveland did not win, one enterprising Republican wrote to Blaine about it some weeks before the election. A righteous Congress, whether Democratic or Republican, should as soon as possible pass a civil service reform bill, placing all such offices beyond the baleful influence of political changes. A faithful public servant in that line should be retained so long as he fills his position in a perfectly satisfactory manner, and no such true and faithful servant should ever be subjected to fear of losing his position through any possible change in political administration. None should ever be discharged, except for just cause, and not for politics.</p><p>ST. JOHN.</p><p>What do our temperance friends think now of the politico-prohibition gospel according to St. John? How do they admire the result? Do they prefer Cleveland and undoubted Democratic enmity to their cause to Blaine and equitable Republican rule, with possible chances in their favor? In jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire, how do they like the fire as a matter of cool preference? It is a clear case but for St. John the Republican party would have won in New York and the nation. St. John is the male Delilah who has betrayed the proud Republican giant Samson into the hands of the Philistines. The Democrats never fool with such cold water side issues. They always take their whisky straight, and vote as they drink -- straight. Vale, St. John. Don't burn him in effigy, same as they have done in Kansas, but put a string around his neck, with a big stone to it, and drown him in a pond of cold water. He is a sick kitten.</p><p>INCIDENTAL REMARKS.</p><p>Ben Butler should be bottled and kept corked up forever, except as a Democratic candidate for the Presidency. He would make an excellent Democratic President -- with a Republican Congress.</p><p>A man who has only been in Austin three or four years -- only since the flood -- aspired to office at the recent election, but was snubbed by the ruling antediluvians on the ground that, although he was sufficiently able and popular, he had not been here long enough. Yet certain able antediluvians, who got away with nominations for office, got badly beaten in the election. ""What's the matter now?""</p><p>We pay out money freely for the benefit of foreign missions, and to support ministers abroad, yet starve our own hardworking local home preachers --  not in Austin, but elsewhere.</p><p>Several pretty lively fights have occurred as a punctuating wind-up of the election, so to speak, and now Austin has settled down to her bed-rock equanimity for the next two years, or until next election.

TE69,"<p>TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE</p><p>Sunday . . . . . . . . . . . . November 23, 1884.</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Political Bets, Spoils and Fancies -- The Silver Viscount and Depression -- A Heavy Milling Run -- The Mines -- Manhattan Civil Service -- A Stage Driver in a Bad Fix -- A Boom in Red Paint -- St. John -- Donkey Rabbits -- State Prison Warden.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, November 20, 1884.</p><p>During the past week Austin has been but little convulsed with politics, and people generally have quietly settled down to the realization that Cleveland is elected. Bets of hats, clothes and other substantials, have been paid, and even considerable amounts in the way of coin bets have changed hands. There are many, however, who do not give it up yet, and will not until the National Committee of either party shall officially render their final decision in the matter. The opinion has gradually gained ground among Republicans that Cleveland will make a pretty good President after all, especially with the assistance of a Republican Senate. Others, again, bitterly declare that the New York ex-Sheriff and hangman will as soon as he gets seated in the Presidential chair, proceed to politically hang all the Federal officers throughout the Nation, even to the last poor trembling Postmaster; that, notwithstanding all his published sentiments and protestations, he will be obliged to yield to party pressure and divide the spoils of office among his hungry constituency. When one reflects that there are about 40,000 Postmasters in the United States, and that there are at least ten applicants for each postoffice, or 400,000 in all, it is easily seen that Cleveland's time will be pretty well occupied for a year or two in considering so many applications. The friends of Nasby all sympathetically rejoiced with him in having at last secured his long coveted Post office at the Confederate Crossroads. Yesterday, one enthusiastic Democrat, speaking of the congratulatory messages now pouring in from all parts of the county to Cleveland, said: ""Even the Queen of England sends him her congratulations."" Another Democrat thoughtfully remarked: ""Well, I hope they won't re-establish slavery.""</p><p>SILVER DEPRESSION.</p><p>The present largely increased discount on silver, and corresponding depression in that staple product of this State, is an important subject for consideration and discussion. It is plainly to be seen that if this disastrous state of affairs continues, the effect will be to hang up our mill stamps and put a check upon silver mining. Here in Austin, where the mines are exclusively silver, the discount, including expressage, exchange, etc., amounting to over $200,000 a year, is a very serious drawback. If that amount could be turned loose in dividends it would make a very material difference. Various causes are assigned for the depression in silver. Some are of the opinion that the impending change in the political administration has no small influence in the matter. Capital is proverbially timid and apprehensive, and capitalists prefer to watch and wait the result of important political changes, and their possible financial influences and bearings. Speculation may have something to do with it, and also overproduction. Railroad building has been overdone and received a check, which operates detrimentally upon the iron interest, and all industries connected therewith, and this in turn affects the silver interest.</p><p>MINES AND MILL.</p><p>The present run of the Manhattan mill has been almost continuous since the 3d of January last, and bids fair to continue until Christmas, when there will have to be a stoppage for repairs and to allow an accumulation of ore from the various mines. The supply has held out thus far pretty well, but is beginning to run short. Considerable rich ore is still coming out at various points, and there is a good showing of ore to be extracted, but more extensive openings and explorations have to be made, and when the mill stops, the mines as well as the mill will be put in condition for another long and prosperous run.</p><p>MANHATTAN CIVIL SERVICE.</p><p>In the mines, mining works, mills and general service of the Manahattan Company, are miners, engineers, millmen, machinists, business men, and other employees, who have been constantly in the service of the company, in its various and extensive departments, for nearly twenty years. These men, being found well adapted to their respective duties; faithful and efficient in the discharge thereof, have been carefully retained, irrespective of their political proclivities, and the result is seen in the perfect working of the entire system in the most advantageous and economical manner for the benefit of all concerned. All hands, from quill-drivers to dump pickers work harmoniously and everything is under the most admirable system and management. The civil service of the United States could not be better or more sensibly conducted.</p><p>A CHILLED STAGE DRIVER.</p><p>A few evenings ago, just before the election, the Belmont stage came in at the usual time, about 8 o'clock, passing quietly down the street, but not stopping at either the Postoffice to deliver the mail, or at the express office to deposit three bars of bullion, worth about $3,000, which was on the buckboard. The driver sat up on his seat, but apparently took no notice of anything, and let his horse take his own course. Colonel Ellis was addressing a large audience, and there were bonfires on the street. The sagacious horse sheered past the fires, but somehow missed his own stable and went on to another, further down street. It was a sharp, cool evening, and the driver was discovered to be speechless, unconscious and completely chilled and stiffened with the cold. He was taken to the warm barroom of the hotel, where, after some hours of rubbing and doctoring, he was brought to his senses. The last few miles, crossing the summit of the Toiyabe range, his bottle of whisky failed to keep him properly thawed out. He was all right again next morning and drove back to Belmont, where he has been employed since, driving on that end of the route.</p><p>PAINTING THE TOWN RED.</p><p>This newly-invented popular expression has taken practical effect here, and several of our business men have been getting their stores and places of business painted a sanguinary red. Nothing but red will do. Even the Piutes have evidently ""caught on"" to the idea, and now bedaub their faces with red paint more liberally than ever. A fat squaw, with a yellow dress, a blue handkerchief on her head and her face painted a blushing red, looks gay. Should Blaine be elected the price of red paint would go up like a boom in stocks.</p><p>TAILINGS.</p><p>One exasperated Republican has cut St. John out of his Bible. He says he don't want to read any more about him now that he's got into politics and made such a bad mess of it.</p><p>Ed. Gundry, formerly of the Comstock section, with two other miners, went down into Reese River Valley, some ten miles from here, the other day rabbit hunting.

November 30, 1884</p><p>FROM EASTERN NEVADA.</p><p>Thanksgiving Feastivities and Amenities -- Political Speculations and Propositions -- Legislative Views -- Old-Time ""Prairie Schooner"" Outfit --Cassidy's Injustice to Reese River -- Telegraph, Railroad and Odd Fellow Personals -- Vesuvian Sunsets -- Shaken Confidence.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, November 27, 1884.</p><p>Thanksgiving Day is always well observed in this section, and to-day has been no exception to the rule. Austinites are not famous for attending church any more on this day than on Sunday, but when it comes to eating turkey, plum pudding and all that sort of thing they stand in with the most consistent unanimity. Plenty of nice fat geese, ducks, chickens and other eligible birds came in from the ranches, and those who had more powder and shot than coin had only to step out into the hills or valley half a dozen miles or less in order to shoot a plentiful supply of rabbits, sage-hen and other small game for the Thanksgiving feast. Even the Chinese feastingly observed the day, eating plenty of hog done up in all sorts of Celestial culinary styles, and respectfully refraining from shooting off any fire-crackers. Work was suspended in the mines and mill, the day was fine, much friendly visiting was done and numerous unfortunate bachelors and other single persons who had no invitation to dine elsewhere found plenty of the traditional turkey, chicken pot-pie and similar Thanksgiving outfits at the restaurants. The ball of Lander Post, G.A.R., is progressing to-night at International Hall, as a wind-up to the day's festive observances, and is well and appropriately attended.</p><p>POLITICAL.</p><p>In view of the recent most vigorously partisan campaign, it is somewhat amusing to note the perfectly philosophical equanimity with which the result is accepted. There seems to be a sort of settled conviction on the part of Republicans that the country is safe, anyhow, and that the man who was elected President by a 1,147 St. John majority will bear in mind that he literally won by a scratch, and not attempt to run things too exclusively for the benefit of the Democratic party. The Presidents and all precedents of twenty-four years past are all well borne in mind, and the loyal American element which has defended and preserved the integrity of the proud old Republic of the Stars and Stripes still remains just as strong, watchful and determined as ever, tried and true, and regardless of present politically experimental complications. The Republican North and the Solid South must dissolvingly blend, and join hands for mutual interest, and that truly American party which shall best maintain and advance the prosperity and integrity of the grandest, purest and best Republic God's sun ever shone upon, will be the reigning power and loyal safeguard of our country's future.</p><p>LEGISLATIVE.</p><p>Perhaps it may be through the chastening influence of adversity, but it is quite noticeable that the men elected to the Legislature throughout the State are among the best that could be selected, and fully up to the average, if not superior, to previous Legislatures. The Democrats certainly are considerably in the minority, yet in view of the great Republican sweep throughout the State in the recent campaign it is all the more complimentary to the few winning democrats, as indicative of their personal ability and popularity. Dennis and Smyth, the two Democratic Senatorial hold-overs from the ""Great East,"" are both gentlemen of acknowledged ability, and the rest of the Senate is composed of good, square, sensible men whom we all know, and can trust to do able and honest duty by the State with credit to themselves and their constituents. We send three first-rate Assemblymen from Lander, and have no reason not to consider the rest to be equally as good, consequently the material interests of the State are not liable to suffer at Carson this Winter.</p><p>AN OLD TIME OUTFIT.</p><p>Last Monday quite a little sensation was created by the arrival and passage through town of a fourteen-mule team with three big wagons -- a leading wagon and two ""back-actions."" The wagons had lofty sides and high rounded canvass roofs, and two spare animals were hitched on behind with a light saddle horse for riding and herding purposes. There were big barrels lashed to the sides of the wagons for water transportation when crossing desert places, and the whole arrangement reminded one of the huge ""prairie schooners,"" freight and emigrant wagons of the old early times in this State before the Central Pacific Railroad brought longer trains and no greater prosperity. This old time outfit belongs to John Fitzgerald, who was along with it as chief manager and navigator , accompanied by ""Belly-Aching Joe"" and another man as ""helpers,"" and came from Winnemucca, where Fitzgerald has been engaged in freighting to Silver City and other points in Idaho and vicinity for the past eleven years. Railroads ruining his usefulness and profit, he is now on his way to Arizona, where he will follow freighting or sell out. On board his wagons he had about 11,000 pounds of barley, hay, flour and provisions for the route, going as light as possible, and taking the road easy in order to get his team through in good condition. His usual load, hauling from Winnemucca to Silver City, was 30,000 pounds, with sixteen animals and four wagons, but he left one wagon behind, not caring to take it along to Arizona. He will pass through Belmont and probably shape his course down the Muddy to the Colorado, following that river to the most advantageous turnout into the land of the cactus, the horned toad and the scalp-coveting Apache.</p><p>CORRECT.</p><p>That item about the general crookedness and possible extent of Reese river which recently appeared in the Reveille and has been so extensively copied of late, is very correct. The river averages from two to several feet in width, runs across the valley continually from side to side, and irrigates more good land than any other stream of its size in the world. It is so crooked that no fish but an eel can swim up or down it with any sort of comfort, yet it is a very serviceable river. Congressman Cassidy's ungrateful slur about there not being any rivers in Nevada was out of place and uncalled for, and it is hard to say how much that may have influenced his defeat. Had he gone in for boring artesian wells to increase its water supply and its navigation and fish propagation facilities, he might have made a better mark in the sagebrush world and been sent back to where, in his place, the Woodburn twineth, or will soon twine.</p><p>MISCELLANEOUS</p><p>Frank Jaynes, of the Western Union Telegraph Company, was here a day or two since, arranging matters connected therewith, and F.W. Dunn, Superintendent of the Nevada Central Railway, who was recently taken home East to die, also came in very unexpectedly on a business visit. Frank Jaynes' scalp looks older than Sharon's and Dunn is evidently not ""done gone"" yet. Our ""roseate sunsets"" still hold out, and as long as the supply of volcanic eruption dust from Japan and Vesuvius holds out in atmospheric suspension they may be indefinitely continued.</p><p>George Henning, Grand Patriarch of the Odd Fellows in this State, in company with Grand Master J.T. Williams, were in Austin Tuesday. They have been visiting the various Lodges in the State, and report things prosperous in the Order.</p><p>Republicans here as well as elsewhere want to know what right our National Committee had to humbug Republicans throughout the country by sending forth that telegram to the effect that Blaine was elected, when they didn't know any more about it than a Democratic yellow dog. Such nonsense makes people lose both money and confidence.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE70.jpg,territorial

Thanksgiving Day had somewhat of an enlivening influence, yet it was only for the occasion. Everybody found plenty of nice turkeys for sale at four-bits a pound and chickens at forty cents, but they ate them all up, for none are to be seen hung up by the legs for sale any more. But these good American birds are speedily to be found when required, and will flock into town by the wagon load from the ranches very shortly, among the other</p><p>PREPARATIONS FOR CHRISTMAS.</p><p>George Lammerhart, an old-time Comstocker, formerly with Mark Strouse in the meat market business almost next door to the ENTERPRISE office, is in the same business here, and has a corral on Main street near the geographical center of the town, where he has a large herd of big turkeys fattening for Christmas. And they furnish lots of fun for the small boy, who is happiest when he can see about sixty of them roosting on the fence at a time and all noisily responding in gabbling concert to his gentle whistling, sly screeches and hawk imitations. Their excited gabbling can be heard all over town. Carloads of toys and Christmas goods of all descriptions are being opened and arranged for sale at the variety stores, and notwithstanding the tightness of the time and scarcity of coin, the chances are that fully as large quantities of Christmas goods will be sold this season as ever, and perhaps more. It is a noticeable fact on the Comstock, as well as here, that when times are the hardest and people the poorest everybody seems to feel all the more hilarious and inclined to be festively liberal in the observance of the Christmas and New Years holidays.</p><p>A HEALTHY SHOWING.</p><p>The success of the tax collector is always a good indication and criterion of the prosperity of any community. The payment of taxes shows very significantly the degree of confidence taxpayers have in the public welfare and substantial prospective value of property. And so in this isolated community and sparsely settled country the collection of taxes this year has been exceedingly successful, only about two per cent. of the entire assessment roll now remaining uncollected. Of the $2,496 delinquent, nearly half is on the Battle Mountain and Lewis Railroad and the Victorian mining property -- dead or in litigation. This, in reality, leaves only two per cent delinquent on a tax roll of $75,000. This can hardly be excelled, and probably not equalled, by any other county in the State. It certainly shows well for old Lander county.</p><p>AN OLD MINE REOPENED.</p><p>The Naiad Queen, one of the oldest mines in this district, abandoned long years ago from superabundance of water, lack of proper facilities for working, and other natural causes, has recently been relocated, and is being reopened in good and promising shape, by Nye, Samson & Co., some of the oldest and best experienced miners in the Lander Hill ore belt. The Naiad Queen is situated a few rods in the rear of the Manhattan mill, and directly beneath the bed of the main ravine, or Pony Canyon. Its former owners and developers worked it to the depth of about 175 feet, more or less, and had a very good-sized and promising ledge of ore, but, as before stated, having too much water to contend with, and lacking the proper facilities for working, they could not make it pay, and were finally obliged to quit. The present proprietors have erected very neat and effective steam hoisting works, and are pumping, clearing out and repairing the old incline, preparatory to a well organized raid upon the long neglected and abandoned ledge. Thus it is that old mines, abandoned by the early settlers and locators, occasionally, even yet, find men of judgment and experience, with sufficient enterprise and ability to reopen and develop them.</p><p>COMPILE THE LAWS.</p><p>The compiled laws of Nevada, as set forth in two volumes, did very well for a first attempt, but could be very materially improved upon. The compilation has proved to be a very great and valuable convenience, yet that it can be very greatly improved upon is a fact which has become more and more apparent. What is now needed is another compilation of the laws by competent persons revising and correcting the first, and reaching and embracing all legislative enactments down to the present time. The expense would not be great, the State can afford it, and it should be done -- by the most competent, faithful and experienced authorities.</p><p>THE PHANTOM SLOGGER.</p><p>Said he: ""Yer may think I'm drunk, but I ain't. I've had a drink er two, but I know what I'm about 'n don't you forget it. I'm a fighter from Yankee Blade, Battle Mountain or h--l. You see my hands, thorny and hard from mining, milling or any other honest work, but when a feller gets up and goes for me, I jist naterally gets up and goes for him. I always used to think that I could wallop them champions of America, Europe or the world, but one day a feller comes down to see me right in the middle of a first-class match in at Martin's store, where I was havin' things all my own way, like Sullivan. He was a hard hitter, as I soon found out, but when it come right for him to be hit, he never was there. He reminded me of one of them 'ere ""dippers"" that you shoot at along the seashore, and that dive at the flash. When I struck out for his nose I hit over his head or past his ear. His head was never in the right place, and when I lunged past him, he would take me over too d--n slick. I kept at him till I was nearly dead, but never got in one good lick. He must have been a slogger from h--l or some other outside seaport - a sort of phantom ghost, as it were – nothin' to hit at, but hell on the return. I'm discouraged, and never feel happy only when I git tight and meet Tom Cheggs. Then we have it, for he's as big a damn fool as I am, and never sets hisself up for a fighter unless he's drunk. I wish he could meet that feller l found, some day.""</p><p>TERPSICHOREAN.</p><p>We have two or three lots of dancing teachers working up the fantastic heel and toe accomplishments of our spry citizens, and now comes a handsome young lady from Carson, on the same layout. The way she is making numerous Austin lads sashay around and tumble to the racquet is amusing to contemplate.</p><p>To-morrow evening there's going to be a terpsichorean social for the benefit of the Episcopal Church.

Manhattan -- Legislative.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Enterprise.]</p><p>AUSTIN, December 13, 1884.</p><p>The coldest night thus far this season has chilled the Austin thermometer down to ten degrees above zero. Now, how confoundedly indefinite that sounds -- down to ten degrees above zero. Not more than ninety-nine out of 100 intelligent folks know what zero means, except that it is something colder than freezing, and the hundredth one has an indefinite idea that it is simply a short, handy name for the freezing point. Why couldn't old Farenheit have adjusted his thermometer on this last-mentioned proposition? He is dead, and some friend of his ought now to rise and correct his thermometer. Anyhow, Winter seems to have started in, and snow covers this section of the State, with promising indications of plenty more to come. Serene is he whose home lodgings are inside of a good brick or adobe house. Mud, baked or raw-dried, makes the most comfortable dwelling -- cool in summer and warm in Winter. Austin contains more good, solid little mud houses for her population than any other town in the State, and right about now every one is fully occupied. Rents are high enough and no houses for sale at low figures. This reminds me of a festive little incident in the way of</p><p>SELLING A HOUSE.</p><p>Last Spring our mutual friend Spykens had a house intrusted to him for sale. It was not a good time of the year for selling houses, but he started in to do the best he could on the proposition. He offered it for one-third of its value, and went after everybody he thought had any spare coin or disposition to buy. After much speculative wear and tear of shoe leather in that respect, he found an eligible and willing customer. But he was in bad luck. When the customer called to take a look at the concern, a mutual lady friend, who lived near by, feeling interested in the matter, called also. They went through the house, and Spykens tried to show and represent things to the best advantage, but found himself most wofully and unexpectedly handicapped by the lady neighbor aforesaid, who would keep chipping in with a fluent string of incidental remarks and observations: ""Yes, that' so, Mr. Skerry, this house is in a good location enough, but it's not a new house, by any means. The floors are in a pretty fair condition, but look at the walls and ceilings. It has to be papered throughout.""</p><p>""Yes,"" interposed Spykens, ""but it wouldn't cost much to do that, and make the house just as good as new.""</p><p>""I know; but even then it's a cold house for Winter and always was, and just look at the furniture -- all worn out.""</p><p>""But I'm not trying to sell anything more than the house to Mr. Skerry -- the furniture is not for sale.""</p><p>""Oh! Well, anyhow, Mr. Skerry, before you conclude this trade, just go and take a look at that little adobe next to our house. I think they'd sell it, and it would be so much better than this.""</p><p>Spykens smiled very grimly as he showed the party out; trying to remember a few words of the Lord's Prayer. Then he looked in the glass and soliloquizingly consoled himself thusly: ""Smile, old son, smile. You used to think yourself some on a horse trade, but how are you on selling houses? As Farmer Treadway would remark: 'This is one time, my son, where you got your fork in where there wasn't any guano.'""</p><p>But Spykens, although thus unwittingly handicapped, was not entirely cast down. He felt philosophically amused, as it were, at the style of the incident, and subsequently, when he had not the aforesaid lady neighbor to assist him, succeeded in selling the house to another party.</p><p>THE CONCENTRATOR.</p><p>One of the most prominent objects in the milling or mining line here in Austin, is the queer looking big brick, stone and wooden building at the upper part of town, near the Manhattan mill, popularly known as ""the concentrator,"" or more properly the Boston mill. It is the largest building in town, being sixty or eighty feet wide, 100 feet or so long, and of various hights, with a central cockloft towering above, like a cupola on a country Court-house, a turret on a monitor, or a hump on a camel's back. This milling concern was built in the early days of the Reese River District, by a company of Boston capitalists, who had become the happy owners of the Naiad Queen mine, near by. They had it to work the ores from their mine, and it cost over $100,000. And it was filled with machinery for the concentration and reduction of ores, devised by George Krom, a very ingenious Boston mechanic and inventor. Much of the machinery has been removed, but there is still enough left on the eight floors of the spacious , lofty, building to impress the soul of most anybody with a curious degree of wonderment. Numerous little jigging machines are thickly crowded together, with a wilderness of belt and pulley attachments, and from floor to floor are series of elevators, revolving screens, more machines and things indescribable, little and big. The most practical impression to any practical mind upon square inspection of all this vast amount of concentrating machinery, is that there is too much of it; that the whole concentrating arrangement was too multifarious from the start; that the machinery would bear concentrating to begin with before introducing any ore. Naturally, its career was short. It failed to concentrate, or its measure of success was too costly. Anyhow, the fun didn't pay for the powder -- too much money was spent above ground on this mill for financial success in the mine. The Boston Company got discouraged and the result is that the mill or concentrator is now owned principally or altogether by the Manhattan Company, and the mine is relocated by other parties, as mentioned in my last letter.</p><p>TAILINGS.</p><p>There has been but little serious sickness among the Piutes about here of late, but last evening I heard the howling Indian doctor sending forth his intermittent yells from the south hillside, so probably somebody is sick over there. He sings out ""Ho, Joe!"" after a style that would be at once recognized and approved by any of the Nevada county, Cal., men.</p><p>The Manhattan mill will probably shut down and take a rest on the 20th instant. This is in order to make a general cleanup, requisite repairs and allow an accumulation of ore for another good run.</p><p>The next grand source of excitement looked forward to is the convening of the Legislature at Carson. Great expectations are indulged in by many. Much good may come out of Nazareth. Anyhow let us hope for the best.</p><p>ALF. DOTEN.</p>",public://territorial/TE72.jpg,territorial

A foot of snow covers the town, and Lander Hill, Mount Prometheus and the other near croppings of the old Toiyabe range look like a vast row of huge circus tents without any flags, or banners, sternly silent in their ghastly coldness. Yet throughout this quaint little old town an air of comfort and holiday cheer is prevalent. The famous little street railway locomotive ""Mules' Relief,"" snorts, puffs and plunges up and down the track through town, bringing up carloads of wood, general merchandise, provisions and all sorts of supplies from the Nevada Central terminus, half a mile below town, at the mouth of the canyon, men and women go slipping and tumbling up and down the snow and ice-bound streets, young Austin with his dashy little cutter and young Piute with his sled of staves find eligible coasting places everywhere, and jingling bells tell of sleighing parties and grocery commerce on runners. Chickens and turkeys from the ranches and from Iowa are in the markets, and egg-nog with inspiring variations in the saloons. To-morrow -- when the happy New Year commences -- will soon be here, and many a repentant sinner, reflecting upon his foolishnesses of the past year, will make his regular annual swear-off, resolving to lead a better life in the future, and mortify his internal economy with libations of hot water in place of good whisky or beer, even though his stomach and bowels should moan with resultant neuralgia.</p><p>A SAD EPISODE.</p><p>The killing of Sam Woolcock in the Lander shaft, on Christmas Eve, cast a perceptible gloom over the holiday festivities. His death was the result of one of those accidents or casualties formerly so common in the Comstock mines. He and other miners were coming off shift, at 5 P.M., and, in his hurry to be among the first to go up, he attempted to get on board the cage before it had stopped in its proper place at the station. He was caught against the cap timber of the station and knocked down the shaft, falling 200 feet, to the 800 level, into the sump. Both arms were torn off, and one of them was not found until some days afterward. Sammy Woolcock was a Cornishman, and a popular favorite among his countrymen, as well as all others who knew him best. Only the evening previous he was the happiest of the happy, and a leading voice in a hilarious assemblage of Christmas carol singers. The boys had no heart for singing carols after the story of his fearful death was told. His funeral was very fully attended, and over 300 miners followed him to his grave.</p><p>RICH MILLING.</p><p>A few days ago the Manhattan mill, after a prosperous run of about a year, with a resultant yield of more than a million dollars, shut down for its regular annual clean-up. This generally takes about ten days, but on this occasion the operation was performed in six, and the mill started crushing again day before yesterday. A clean-up of the Manhattan mill is a pretty extensive as well as lucrative affair. Being a dry crushing establishment, the dust and light pulp settles everywhere, and the whole concern has to be thoroughly swept from one end to the other, throughout all the various departments. This dust is the very richest of the ore, and worth hundreds of dollars per ton, consequently the yield of bullion bricks is very heavy. Everything and everybody throughout the mill gets saturated with the light, searching dust, and I am almost afraid to state the fabulous amounts that those old stand-bys, Charley Durning, Jimmy Robinson and Jimmy Sullivan have thrashed out of their old clothes at these clean-ups.</p><p>RICH ORE.</p><p>During the closing days of the last milling run, just before the clean-up, the ""tributers"" hastened to get their ""crushings"" in, not knowing how long the mill would stop. Tribute ore is generally the richest, because the tributers, in order to lessen the heavy cost of milling as much as possible, sort and dress their ore very carefully and closely, dividing it into three or four classes. These small lots or crushings of ore, generally from five to fifteen tons, give a surprisingly rich yield, sometimes as high as 5,000 per ton. One of the recent crushings mentioned, belonging to Welch & Co., gave the following milling returns per ton: First Class, $3,300; second, $1,200; third, $400; fourth, $175. There was only about five tons of it in all, but it was certainly pretty good-- what there was of it.</p><p>""PICKIN' GOB.""</p><p>Heretofore in this long series of letters I have described the ""dump pickers"" as boys or men -- generally boys -- who watch around the mining dumps for stray bits of ore which get dumped out among the waste and, but for their eager watchfulness, would be forever lost. ""Pickin' dump"" and ""pickin gob"" are pretty much the same thing, only one is above and the other below ground, and both are, of course, purely mining terms. In breasting out these small, very rich veins, the waste rock is thrown back out of the way, and is called the ""gob."" All the waste necessarily contains more or less scatterings of ore from blasting and handling which can be found by careful search with expert hands and eyes. George W. Dale, a member of the last Legislature, from Lander county, for some time past has worked at the Patriot mine, Yankee Blade, near here. He sharpened picks and made himself generally useful, and tried his hand in the mine very successfully at ""pickin' over the gob."" He found from ten to 100 pounds a day, and finally had a pretty good crushing, the result of which surprised him. He left a few days ago to see his folks in Kansas and Illinois and attend the New Orleans Exposition. He said he should be gone five or six months and then come back to pick gob again.</p><p>RUBY SILVER.</p><p>The largest and richest piece of ruby silver ore ever sent from these mines to any public exhibition was forwarded recently to the New Orleans Exposition. It weighs about 100 pounds and is almost pure silver, besides being of remarkable beauty, such as pertains only to ruby silver. Some very rich and beautiful ore has been coming from the Lander shaft and other points for several weeks past. None of this character of ore was to be found at the surface, above the water level. In fact it has always seemed a little singular that the first ledge located here, the Pony Express, never paid, but merely led to the discovery of numerous other paying ledges. John Frost, the old original discoverer and locator of them, is still on deck as chief manager of the surface work machinery of all the mines, which belong to the Manhattan Company. May he live numerous years, for I am firmly convinced that when he dies the mines will give out.</p><p>THE CURFEW BELL.</p><p>Rings just now as I write, as a signal for all youthful boys to go home. It has proven to be a most excellent arrangement. Parents admire it and the boys are greatly benefited, morally and physically. Joe King, our efficient Chief of Police, who rings it at exactly 8 o'clock every evening, never misses giving it the exact eight strokes. And hundreds of people count them on him and set their clocks and watches. If he should ever get off time or miss a stroke an infuriated populace would immediately rush forth and hang him with the bell-rope.</p><p>VALEDICTORY.</p><p>During my residence and journalistic career of three years in Austin I believe I have written up pretty much everything of special interest here, local social and political, and the fading year now falling into the silent sleep of the eternal past, suggests the idea of letting my much-worn pencil also take a rest, for a while at least, so far as this locality is concerned. Moreover, fortune consenting and his Satanic Majesty offering no further objections, before another week shall pass, I propose to take Horace Greeley's advice ""Go West, young man,"" and go upon a visit to the western portion of the State where I formerly spent so many of the happiest and most prosperous years of my life, there to linger awhile over the depressed croppings of the good old Comstock, meander among numerous old time friends, and be with those nearest and dearest to me. I shall leave with many happy memories of Austin, few unpleasant ones, and part with some as true-hearted, unselfish friends here as any I have ever found anywhere. Perhaps in the sweet by-and-by, when the deep snows of the Toiyabe range have melted and run off down the canyons, when the wintry clouds have rolled by, and the honeysuckle and wild plum blossoms are belching forth their fragrance upon the Spring breezes, I will return to take a sniff at the same. Just now the beautiful snow has no charms for me.</p><p>WESTWARD BOUND.</p><p>BATTLE MOUNTAIN, Nev., January 3.</p><p>There's always a river to cross,</p><p>Always an effort to make,</p><p>If there's anything good to win,</p><p>Any rich prize to true;</p><p>Yonder the charming scene;</p><p>But deep and wide, with a troubled tide,</p><p>Is the river that lies between.</p><p>The writer of the above lines was eminently correct, and he would all the more appreciate the fact could he be with me just now. I left Austin this morning, but an unfortunate locomotive, in trying to make a flying switch, ran itself off the track, buried its nose in the beautiful snow and went to sleep. This detained us five mortal hours, and we reached Battle Mountain too late to connect with the west bound Central Pacific express train, so here I am caught out and detained for twenty-four hours on my journey. There is only half as much snow here as in Austin -- only six or seven inches -- that's one comfort. Devoutly I mutter a few words of the Lord's Prayer, hum ""One more river to cross,"" telegraph a few explanatory words to my expectant friends, shake the bar-keeper for a hot toddy, get stuck, and then sullenly retire to the dining room. I feel inconsolably revengeful, but these steaks are tough, and as they disappear, together with what biscuits and other fodder that lies about within reach, washed down with a few cups of tea, I wonder why the landlady eyes me so severely. Has she any animosity against me? Then I tramp the broad plank-walk, smoking a mean cigar, wondering which side of the town has the most houses, and what they will take for the lot, and finally subside for the night into a cold, hard bed to catch a few hours' sleep, but only succeed in catching an infernally bad cold. I expect Battle Mountain is rather of a pleasant place to be in when one is there voluntarily. Some very good and agreeable people certainly do live there, for I have found them. The workshops and headquarters of the Nevada Central Railroad are located here, there are some handsome, well-stocked business houses, many neat family residences with fruit trees, and no town on the Pacific Coast is better watered. There are twenty-four artesian wells scattered through the town, all flowing except two, and such clear, cool, soft water, and so much of it running to waste. It's no wonder that they never drink whisky in Battle Mountain when they have such an affluence of glorious water. I forget how many times we crossed Reese river in getting here, but am only anxious to navigate across or along the Humboldt as soon as possible.</p><p>OUT OF THE WILDERNESS.</p><p>RENO, Nev., January 4, 1885.</p><p>The train of deliverance came to Battle Mountain at 12:30 PM. to-day, about an hour and a half late, and I was soon being whirled merrily westward, at a pace that made up the lost time before we reached Wadsworth. We skirted the Humboldt, and we crossed and recrossed it to my satisfaction, and when the great broad, frosty Sink was left behind, it was a comfort to know that there was only ""one more river to cross,"" and that was the Truckee. Yet we crossed it and got on the wrong side, and had to cross again. Oh! how many more Truckees have we to cross? Sharp 8 o'clock brought us into the glaring lights and wild turmoil of Reno, where I was only too happy to make myself at home and wait for the morning train for Carson.</p><p>AT THE STATE CAPITAL.</p><p>CARSON CITY, Nev., January 9, 1885.</p><p>The last river I crossed after leaving Reno last Monday morning was Steamboat creek, and ""Sharon's cwooked wailwoad,"" as Sutro used to call the Virginia and Truckee, ferried me over that turbulent stream all right. I have met whole droves of old friends and acquaintances since then, from all parts of the State, and especially from the Comstock, attending as members or observers of the opening Legislative session. And speaking of the railroads, almost the first acquaintances I met on arriving were Yerington and Steve Gage. Of course Yerington belongs here. He is one of the fixtures, an integral part and parcel of the country. He has made his mark in the past, his record stands inspection and he is still making, but what is Steve Gage driving at? Only this and nothing more: He accidentally happens to visit Carson at each session of the Legislature, and feels a little interested in hearing what is said or likely to be said about the Central Pacific Railroad, in which some of his friends hold several shares of the stock. He has gone back to San Francisco, but will return before the Legislature adjourns. On my arrival I found that I had already been elected in caucus to the responsible position of Engrossing Clerk of the Senate, and even a nice private room provided wherein to domicile my weary form. Many thanks to many good friends. This blessed old town has improved considerably since I saw it last, three years ago, and must still further improve and advance, for it has agricultural and other resources of prosperity around it, to say nothing of the new Government building to be erected here, for which an appropriation of $100,000 has been obtained, which is a pretty big thing of itself for any town. How would Reno like that? Our new legislators have but fairly got to work this week. At the opening, last Monday, the shortening of the legislative term from sixty to even twenty-one days was boldly advocated and warmly discussed, but it will extend to the full limit. In fact, if such cranky vote and rescind legislation  as was indulged in the first two or three days should be much followed up, an extra session would be required.</p><p>ALF.

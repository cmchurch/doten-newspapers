SFH01,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DAILY HERALD.]</p><p>Present and Prospective Value of the Virginia Mines—The Occidental—Early Failures—Present Success—Total Yield $700,000—Fifty-six men Employed in the Mine—Immense Quantities of Eighteen-Dollar Ore—A New Mill to be Built at the Mouth of the Mine—Profits from Five to Eight Dollars per Ton—Bright Prospects for the Future.</p><p>VIRGINIA, March 20th, 1869.</p><p>Now that White Pine is looming up in all the vastness that distance and consequent vagueness give; when the East and the West are pouring into that new El Dorado their thousands of hopeful hearts that dream of fortune in a day; when secure investments and moderate but certain gains are disregarded in the mad pursuit of what at best must prove an ignis fatuus to all but a favored few; it may seem scarce worth the while to describe, either in general or in detail, the present condition and future prospects of what but lately, in public estimation, as it is yet in reality, is the chiefest of silver lodes, which founded a State and indirectly peopled a territory equal in extent to the domain of many a monarchy.</p><p>It may be, however, that no more appropriate time could be chosen; that a full and truthful exposition of the developments which have been, and are being made in those mines situated upon, or immediately contiguous to, the Comstock lode, by more thoroughly acquainting the public with the future value of this great vein, which for a decade has added a steady stream to the wealth of the world, may deter many from sacrificing the substance for the shadow.</p><p>To this end I have determined upon giving an account of the present appearance of the workings of the various companies of prominence, from personal inspection and observation, wherever practicable, aided by old '49-ers, men of large mining experience, who have resided here since the first discovery of silver, and who are thoroughly conversant with all matters pertaining to the Comstock.</p><p>Commencing at the south, the first location of any importance or present value is the Occidental.</p><p>The Occdental is situated about three miles from Virginia, on the northeast side of the Leet & Birdsall toll road to Dayton.  It was originally taken up in 1860 for lime; the character of the surface rock fitting it for that purpose.  The amount of silver contained was so small that it could not be profitably worked for that metal in those days of high prices, although several parties during the succeeding five years attempted it at various times.  Finally, in July, 1865, the mine passed into the possession of Messrs. Weston & Slanck, who, having a mill of their own eligibly situated, were enabled to work the rock with a small profit.  Since then the quality of the ore has steadily improved, as depth was attained, and the bullion shipment has risen to about $40,000 monthly; $9,000 was shipped during the past week.  Under the management of these gentlemen about 40,000 tons of ore have been worked, yielding over $700,000; the rock averaging from $15 to $18 per ton, and paying a profit of from $5 to $7.  At present but eighty tons per day are being shipped to the mill, owing to the wretched condition of the roads, which renders hauling almost an impossibility.  It is intended, as soon as the weather admits, to commence the construction of a mill at the mouth of the lower tunnel, to contain forty stamps, or more, if required, with a daily crushing capacity of 100 tons.  The mill will cost $80,000.  When completed the immense bodies of low grade ore which the mine contains can be extracted and reduced at a cost which will leave a net profit of from $3 to $5 per ton.</p><p>The Occidental is located upon the same lode as the claims in Flowery District; the cropings being plainly traceable for its entire length of 1,800 feet, and through the adjoining claims on the north.  No assessment has ever been levied; the rock paying from the surface down.</p><p>The ore is at present being extracted by a tunnel commencing a little above the traveled road, but a tunnel has been driven in 820 feet, some distance down the canon, and should cut the lode in from 50 to 80 feet farther.  It is confidently expected that the lode will be struck in that distance in from two to four weeks.  At the face of this tunnel a large stream of water is pouring down, the flow being estimated at twenty inches.  As it is likely to prove constant, it will be ample to supply the wants of the new mill to be built.  The upper workings of the mine, which but recently were flooded, have been completely drained wince this stream was tapped; conclusively showing that the lower tunnel cannot be far distant from the ledge.  Fifty and seventy-five feet from the back end small stratas, or feeders, of quartz and clay, varying from two to three feet in width, are struck, which contain a little pay.  These stratas have the same dip as the ledge in the workings above.  Four hundred and fifty feet from the mouth of this tunnel a connection is made with an old tunnel running east, known as Lee's tunnel, by which a good current of air is obtained.</p><p>I should have stated, perhaps, that the ledge runs nearly north and south; the exact strike being north twenty degrees west.  The dip is about forty-five degrees.  Both tunnels of the company are run in a direct north and south line.</p><p>The lode is struck in the upper tunnel one hundred and eighty feet from the mouth.  The tunnel then deflects a little to the west, following the ledge.  No hanging or foot-wall is here exposed.  At this point, and for several hundred feet, the lode is largely composed of gypsum and carbonate of lime.  Further on it assumes more of quartzose character; as indeed, it does as greater depth is attained.</p><p>Two hundred and seventy feet in the foot-wall is exposed, and the ledge is cross-cut for thirty feet without striking the hanging wall.  At this point there are two bodies of fair milling ore, eight feet in width each, one lying directly on the foot-wall, the other to the east, with a division of about twelve feet of low grade rock, which can all be worked with profit at the new mill.  The eastern body has here been stopped out for some fifteen or twenty feet below the floor of the tunnel, and both bodies have been stopped up eighty or ninety feet; the rock paying from $15 to $18.</p><p>A few feet farther on a second chamber has been excavated, forty feet in width and about fifty in height, of the same character of rock.</p><p>A little over three hundred feet from the mouth a winze has been sunk, following the foot-wall, to the depth of 110 feet, from which large quantities of ore are being extracted.  The quality improves somewhat with depth, and the ledge widens.  This winze will connect with the lower tunnel, a distance of 400 feet.  Three hundred feet from this winze a second has been sunk to the depth of seventy-six feet, also following the foot-wall, which is in good ore all the way; assays of rock taken from the mouth going as high as $90.  No work is at present being done on this winze.  Besides the extraction from the first winze the ledge has been stopped out at various points for a distance of over 200 feet towards the surface, and the ore is delivered in the tunnel by means of a number of chutes.  Between the first and second chute there is a space of 300 feet of solid ground, but sixty-six of which have been worked out.  The course of the ledge is uniform the whole distance, the country rock to the west occasionally swelling and forcing the lode to the east of the line of the tunnel.  In such cases cross-cuts for a few feet have again exposed the ledge.</p><p>About 750 feet from the mouth, the direction of the tunnel is slightly changed, so as to run nearly north; and it is driven through clay for about 200 feet.  The direction is then changed more to the wet, and the lode should again be struck in a distance of 60 feet.</p><p>By the workings at present, a body of ore of uniform quality, milling from $15 to $18, averaging ten feet in width, is exposed for 600 feet in length and 400 feet in depth; equivalent to 120,000 tons.  Of this, from 40,000 to 50,000 tons have been worked, leaving on hand about 75,000 tons.  The quantity of low grade are in sight, which will mill from $9 to $12, and can be worked at a profit when the new mill is erected, is fully as great.  Should the lode continue of the same width and quality to the depth of the lower tunnel, a distance of 300 feet from the bottom of the first winze, the Company will have sufficient ore for a number of years.</p><p>Fifty-six men are now employed at the mine.  Very little timber is used, the ground being solid.  One divident of $2 per share (there are 1,000 shares in the claim) has been declared by the company; and I understand that they will continue to pay them regularly, with the exception, perhaps of a few months, when the profits will be employed in the construction of the new mill.  The prospects of the mine are certainly very flattering, and with the completion of their contemplated improvements, and consequent ability to crush the immense amount of low grade ore on hand at a profit, the company ought to have a long lease of financial prosperity.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH01.jpg,sf-herald
SFH02,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>Big Blast of the Sierra Nevada—Prospects of the Mine—The Ophir Mine—The Gould and Curry Mine—The Drama—White Pine Excitement Decreasing—Unfavorable Reports.</p><p>VIRGINIA, April 2, 1869.</p><p>The big blast at the Sierra Nevada mine was let off at 10 A. M. to-day and did splendid execution, throwing down and loosening hundreds of tons of rich ore in which free gold is seen quite plentifully besprinkled. The bullion from the last clean-up is retorted and at Wells, Fargo & Co.'s for shipment to San Francisco to-night. There are two sacks of it, and it sums up to $15,000, rather more than was expected. The bullion returns of next month will be even better still. You may think this is rather a big blast on my part for the Sierra Nevada mine, but it is simply the truth, as verified by the bullion returns.</p><p>The prospects of the Sierra Nevada mine are better to-day than I have yet seen them. Nothing has ever been developed at the lower depths of that mine worth mentioning, but at the surface there are thousands upon thousands of tons of ore, rich in free gold, which, under the present active and energetic management, is being brought to light, and made to yield up its closely hidden treasures. Under the Bob Apple administration, this was allowed to lie idle, while the money so abundantly assessed and collected from bleeding stockholders was expended in sinking away down in the bowels of the earth after imaginary deposits, building new hoisting works, and getting ready to do something. Bob did begin to go after the surface ore a little towards the last, but he did not find the best of it. A new board of trustees was elected by the stockholders, and a little man named T. F. Smith is now Superintendent of the Sierra Nevada. Smith nosed out the lead, and has opened out and developed ore enough to last for the next five or six years, and some of it, especially that which has been run through during the last fifteen days, paying very richly. The mill is very convenient to the mine, so much so that the ore is dumped directly into it, the whole cost of extraction and milling only amounting to about five dollars per ton, so that all over that amount counts among the profits. The run for the last month will yield far better than anticipated, especially these last fifteen days. There are nearly forty men employed in and about the mine, and the bullion-producing operations are confined to the surface workings. It is proposed, however, in the course of a few weeks to pump out the main shaft, and prospect the ledge at that point to a great depth, especially to the eastward from the lowest level of the shaft. Whether anything is developed or not at the greatest depths, the Sierra Nevada certainly has the best thing on surface ore of any claim on the Comstock ledge.</p><p>Other Mines.</p><p>The Ophir Company are still busily and energetically drifting west from their new shaft, at the 700 foot level. They are in now about 180 feet from the shaft, and the face of the drift is in pretty hard rock, of a favorable character, however, so that it blasts and works well. The great Comstock at this point is apparently divided in two seemingly distinct ledges or sections of the same ledge, known as the ""front"" or ""east"" ledge, and the ""back"" or ""west"" ledge. By means of this drift it is expected that the front ledge will be cut in about 250 or 300 feet from the shaft, and the back ledge in about 100 feet further. This 700 foot level is 400 feet deeper than the old Latrobe tunnel, which passed through the front ledge, developing a very promising quality and quantity of low grade ore. What will be developed by this new drift is of course merely a matter for hopeful anticipation and speculation; but there are excellent reasons to believe that good ore will surely be found.</p><p>The Gould & Curry shaft is to-day once more pumped out, and this evening or some time to-night sinking at the bottom will be resumed. You will recollect that it is just penetrating the east wall of the Comstock, over 1200 feet below the top of the shaft, or 1500 feet below the level of the croppings. What it will develop, of course, no man knoweth but stockholders and their friends, and everybody else are all hopeful, for the quartz at the bottom of the shaft is of a very promising quality and some few little streaks of ore are said to have been seen in it. The story, however, will soon be told, now, without further anticipation on my part, for the shaft is to be sunk down through until the west wall of the ledge is found, which will be in two or three hundred feet farther, allowing the ledge to maintain its present known and established dip or inclination to the east of forty-five degrees. Who knows but that the Ophir and the Gould & Curry may yet resume their old position among the leading mines of the Comstock? These three mines, of which I have written, are the only ones on the north section of the ledge—from the Savage northward—which are doing anything worth mentioning in the way of development, but just in proportion to their success will be the disposition of other mining companies in that section to follow suit.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>Miss Annette Ince and Harry Edwards, supported by a very excellent dramatic company, are drawing very fair audiences at Piper's Opera House. Miss Ince takes a benefit to-night, and will have a crowded house. The classic play of Ion will be given. Edwards will also be given a good benefit next Monday night. This week concludes their engagement. Next Tuesday evening Amy Stone commences an engagement, opening with Fanchon. Her husband also appears, of course, in connection with the balance of the company now performing at the Opera House.</p><p>White Pine.</p><p>I don't believe the excitement and tendency White Pinewards is quite so strong here as it is in San Francisco—at least I hope not. It is bad enough anyhow, but it was much worse awhile ago. It ""went through"" our floating population at a pretty lively rate, so that check-guerrillas, vagrants, garroters, bummers and similar nuisances are comparative scarce here, although the disease also walked off with many good church members. The accounts now coming from the famous new Silverado are not very favorable, and this has caused quite an abatement of the fever. It is a quarrelsome country out there at White Pine, I should judge from the thousand and one disputes reported about town lots, mining claims, and all that sort of thing. Even in the Eberhardt they commenced by chiseling each other, and the man who located the claim is not allowed a taste of its riches at the hands of the very men he located. I kind of like the way my old friend Bluxton has subsided down into. He located several claims on Treasure Hill, and got into some sort of a difficulty with his partners in every claim he located. At last he writes me as follows: ""I've got a claim now that nobody can't devil me about. It's only 400 feet—200 feet for location and 200 for discovery, and I'm the only so of a gun in it.""</p><p>A.D.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH02.jpg,sf-herald
SFH03,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>The Gold Hill Mining Calamity.</p><p>GOLD HILL, April 7th—8 P. M.</p><p>The fire which was discovered in the Yellow Jacket mine at 7 o'clock this morning, and of which you have received a full telegraphic account, is not by any means quenched. It is still burning, and will most probably continue to do so to-night at least. The extent of it, however, is not great as yet. Firemen just out of the mine, and who have stopped down there during the past hour in the 800-foot level, where the fire is, say that it is about 250 feet south of the shaft, and does not extend more than a dozen sets of timbers in length toward the Kentuck, as far as they have been able to ascertain; but it seems to be working upward, and they find great difficulty in getting a stream directly at it. It seemed to be burning up into the timbering above, where it had been worked out and filled in with waste, thus letting down large quantities of loose earth and rock, which had the effect to fill up the drift and stopping the draft of air which had been so strongly circulating through into the Kentuck and Crown Point.</p><p>The present prospects are that the fire will be smothered out or extinguished before morning, yet it may not be, for it is the hardest thing in the world to judge of a fire like this, cooped up in the bowels of the earth, where it cannot be got at or respectably managed. Between where this fire is and the Kentuck mine, there is about 50 feet of the drift untimbered; therefore the fire cannot pass there, and has to work above, in the timbers of the worked out ground. I think no great or permanent injury has or will accrue to either this or the other mines. The loss of life is the greatest and most terrible calamity. There is a bare possibility that the men at the lower level of the Crown Point mine, below where the smoke and fatal gas generated is supposed to extend, may be still alive, but the hopes in that direction are indeed small, although the Roots patent blower has been forcing fresh air down to that level continually, for they have made no signal, and when the cage was let down to that level with a lighted lantern and a message, no reply was sent up.</p><p>The following is a correct list of the names of the 23 men missing and supposed to be still in the mine: Michael McCormick, Peter Blouin, Patrick Buckley, James Bickell, George Edmonds, A. G. Grant, Edward Jewell, William Jewell, Jonathan Joes, Thomas Laity, William Mitchell, Joseph Matthews, Archie McDougall, Thomas McCallin, Thomas McCoy, Daniel O'Neill, John O'Brien, James Peters, A. Reinay, K. Ryan, George Tampkins, John Rowen, Thomas Toland.</p><p>The names of the dead thus far brought out of the fatal depths are: From the Yellow Jacket mine, John Ring, Joseph McClellan and John Hogan; from the Kentuck, Anthony Toy and Patrick E. Quinn; from the Crown Point, Richard Bickell. The last named was killed in coming up out of the mine on the cage with his brother George. Overpowered by the smoke and foul gas, he probably fainted, and was dragged against the side timbering of the shaft, as his head was torn almost completely off and his left arm hung by a small strip of skin to the shoulder. George also came to the surface insensible, but reclining over him with a death-like grip that it was difficult to disengage, his last instinctive idea seeming to be to hold his brother safe in his arms. He has remained insensible ever since, and gasping with asphyxia produced from inhaling the deadly smoke and gas. He has four or five of our best physicians to attend him, but his chances for recovery are exceedingly small, and he bids fair to die before morning.</p><p>This is the most terrible calamity of the kind which has ever happened in this State, and a cloud of sorrow hangs not only over this community, but grief and dire distress is carried into the bosom of many a family, for many of these victims were married men. The origin of the fire is supposed to be from some miner's candle stuck against the timbering, after the too novel style.</p><p>A. D.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH03.jpg,sf-herald
SFH04,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL, (Nev.,) April 11th.—7 P. M.</p><p>The Great Mining Calamity.</p><p>I have just returned from a short round of inspection at the scene of the disaster. The boilers of the hoisting works are still sending heavy volumes of steam down the shafts of the Yellow jacket, Kentuck and Crown Point, each one of which is as tightly closed as possible, yet considerable of the hot vapors from below escape through the surface timbering and chinks not easily got at or stopped. That from the Yellow Jacket is strongly impregnated with gas and light smoke, but partakes more of steam that it did yesterday, showing that although the fire may not be extinguished, yet the mine must be pretty well filled and saturated with the steam. From the Kentuck shaft, nothing but steam issues and from the Crown Point comes steam, smoke and gas mixed, with the steam predominating more than it did yesterday. It is not of course known at present whether the fire is really quenched or not but I do not believe it is, quite. It was proposed to open the shafts to-morrow (Monday) morning, but I believe that idea is abandoned, and they will remain closed under the steaming process for the next two or three days.</p><p>Extent of the Damage.</p><p>How much each mine is injured by this disaster will only be known after the shafts are re-opened; at present it is merely a matter of speculative conjecture. I can merely reiterate what I stated in my last letter, supported by the general impression of those who should know best, that the fire has not been at all extensive and has not destroyed any great amount of timbering even in the Yellow Jacket mine; at the cost of a few days' work and a few hundred dollars, the whole will probably be repaired again as good as ever. Owing to the nature of the workings, and the situation of the timbering at that point, it is difficult to conceive how it could readily pass through into the Kentuck mine, and no one believes that it got into the Crown Point at all. Such a body of steam constantly driven down into these mines and permeating every tunnel, drift, winze, stope, breast and chamber for such a length of time is extremely liable to saturate the timbering, earth, ore and everything else, and perhaps may do some damage in that way. It will take some time for the mines to dry out, the unwholesome gases generated to pass off, and the air to become as comparatively good as it was before. The loss of time and heavy expenses entailed in the extinguishing of the fires, recovering the bodies, funeral charges, donations to the sufferers, may all be legitimately counted among the losses by stockholders, but permanent injure to either mine I consider out of the question. No ore will probably be produced from either mine under a week at least, even though the fire is already extinguished.</p><p>Horrors yet to Come.</p><p>When I was at the Crown Point Works this evening I saw the carpenters busily at work making some long, narrow boxes, in which to put the bodies of the eight men still remaining in the mines. These, are we have before stated, George Edwards, Daniel O'Neil, Thomas Laity, and A. Reinay, all at the 600-foot level of the Crown Point Mine. In the Kentuck, Joseph Gassen is at the 700-foot level, and Martin Clowney at the 800-foot level. When found, they will have been nearly or quite a week in that poisonous, hot, reeking, confined atmosphere, and their decomposed condition may be imagined. They will be at once sewed into blankets or canvas, put into the boxes and thus brought out.</p><p>Coroner's Inquests.</p><p>Coroner Symons has been busy during the last two days, and has held inquests upon the bodies of 21 of the victims; he will continue. In these inquests the question of who was to blame at all, or accountable in any way for this terrible disaster, has been freely brought up and considered, yet nothing has been elicited attaching blame or culpability upon any one. There was a rumor quite prevalent yesterday that Mr. Kellogg, the foreman of the Yellow Jacket mine, had been arrested on a charge of being somehow guilty in that respect, but this was totally false and unjust.</p><p>Cause of the Fire.</p><p>The origin of the fire still remains unaccounted for, except from a lighted candle having been carelessly left where it could catch to the wood work, and it had evidently been burning for some time when discovered. An explosion of powder or gas is said to have occurred shortly afterward; but we are informed on the best of authority that no powder was where it could then explode. Two or three of the men who came out of the Yellow Jacket mine at that time, however, declare than they heard a noise which sounded something like a deadened report of a gas explosion.</p><p>Flags at Half Mast.</p><p>The flags on all the mining works, engine houses and other prominent places throughout Gold Hill and Virginia have been flying at half mast ever since last Wednesday, when the great calamity occurred.</p><p>Relief for the Distressed.</p><p>The Relief Committee appointed at Gold Hill to receive donations and contributions for the widows, orphans and other family sufferers, and attend to the proper disbursement and application of the same, have already received liberal sums of money from prompt and generous California, amounting to over two thousand dollars, with good promise of plenty more, and tomorrow evening, the greatest benefit ever known takes place at Piper's Opera House, Virginia, the entire gross receipts of which will be applied to this most worthy object. The entire dramatic company have freely volunteered, and Piper gives the use of his popular theater, also, free. There will not be even any gas or printing bills to pay, and Hampton's omnibus line will have on extra teams and busses, running between here and Virginia from six o'clock P. M. until midnight, fare 50 cents each way, to and from the theater, and the entire receipts are also to be donated by him to the relief fund. The price of tickets is placed at $2, and several hundreds are already sold. Everybody buys a ticket most willingly, and some have bought them by the dozen, tearing them up and throwing them away afterwards, so that they could not be used. The proceeds of that benefit will probably sum up to $5,000 or $6,000; many even estimate it at $10,000; at any rate, Piper will see a crowded house that night, if he never does again.</p><p>A.

SFH05,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.,) April 18th—8 P. M.</p><p>The Situation.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket, Kentuck and Crown Point shafts remained closed, in order to smother out the fire if possible, from last Monday night until yesterday forenoon, when the Yellow Jacket shaft was reopened and preparations made for going down into the mine once more. The Kentuck shaft was kept closed until 3 P. M. to-day, when it also was reopened. The Crown Point shaft is still tightly closed, although full preparations are made for reopening it, and steam is up in the hoisting works ready for commencing operations as soon as it shall be deemed expedient. There is no surface sign of fire at present existing in either the Crown Point or the Kentuck mines, except that a small quantity of gaseous smoke comes from the mouth of the latter shaft. I understand that it is the intention to explore the interior of both those mines if possible to-morrow.</p><p>Wonderful Secrecy.</p><p>For reasons best known to themselves, the controlling powers of Yellow Jacket mine yesterday took a notion to have a private examination of the same, carefully allowing outsiders to understand that the shaft would not be reopened before Monday (to-morrow). They accordingly barricaded all the doors and windows of the building, and just before noon they started the works. The blower was put into operation, sending fresh air from the surface down into the mine, and the shaft being uncovered, attempts were made to descent on the cage. The timbering in the shaft was, however, found to be so much swollen and sprung out of place by the long-continued action of the hot steaming process adopted to extinguish the fire, that the cage would not pass without considerable hewing and trimming out. This proved a very difficult job, by reason of the hot poisonous gas and smoke coming up, which made several of the workmen sick, especially during last night. One of them was brought out of the shaft perfectly crazy, and so convulsively violent, that it took half a dozen men to hold him. Dr. Hall was sent for, and he is to-day pretty much recovered from that terrible asphyxiative sickness, which had nearly proven fatal. It was not until about noon to-day that the 900-foot level was reached. The air below the 900-foot level, where the fire was, is pretty good. Whether there is any fire still existing in the mine, or what may be the actual extent of the great damage supposed to be done in those important subterranean regions, is most probably better known at the present time to the officers and controllers of the mine than to your correspondent, the public or the majority of hopeful stockholders. This secret session is still progressing, and consequently many are the wild rumors afloat of continued fire, immense damage, and extensive caves. The Crown Point shaft was sounded yesterday, and less than 200 feet of water found at the bottom.</p><p>The Sufferers.</p><p>Not the small stockholders, but the families and dependent relatives of the victims by the great mining calamity, are all being well provided for, thanks to a truly and munificently generous public. California has most kindly and bountifully contributed, and the whole-souled people of this section have responded abundantly to the call for immediate assistance—pecuniary and otherwise. I received a letter from White Pine a day or two since, which states that they will contribute $5,000 to the relief fund from that famous locality.</p><p>Simmering Down.</p><p>Speaking of White Pine, there is a wonderful abatement of the rush towards that rich land of the cap-rock and the chloride perceivable lately. You San Franciscans can keep on rushing if you choose, but as far as this section is concerned, fully as many are coming back here from White Pine as there are going, especially within the last week or ten days. Many are pronouncing it a bilk of the very first water, while others say that what little chloride and horn silver there is in Treasure Hill will all be dug up and backed out of the district inside of six months, and that even now it is the tightest kind of scratching to make grub there. The fact of it is, that everything is totally overdone at White Pine. The mineral resources of the district thus far developed are very rich, but not extensive, or bidding fair for permanency. They are not sufficient for one-tenth part of the population which will overrun that section this summer. The true reason why so many Gold Hillers and Virginians are coming back is, that they find nothing out there which, for true remunerative permanency or the substantial support of a large community, can anywhere near equal the old Comstock. That's what's the matter.</p><p>A. D.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH05.jpg,sf-herald
SFH06,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DAILY HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.), April 23d—8 P. M.</p><p>Still Burning.</p><p>In spite of the most active and strenuous means adopted to extinguish that obstinate fire which has existed in our mines for over two weeks, it is still burning, and in reality the prospects for getting entirely rid of it immediately are not especially encouraging, even now. Water and steam have been alternatively used to as good effect as possible, but the grand difficulty still is to get a fair rake at the enemy. It has been extinguished in several places where found, but at the present time it is burning principally between the 700 and 600-foot levels of the Kentuck mine, near the Yellow Jacket line, in the east ledge. How far it extends into the latter mine is not well known, as no one can either work or explore there in the drifts at that level, by reason of the deadly gas and smoke which is far worse than in either of the other mines. In order to stop the draft of air so encouraging to the fire, the 700-foot station of the Yellow Jacket shaft is closely blocked, and the gaseous smoke comes out through the 600-foot level, showing that the fire extends upward. The Crown Point shaft is comparatively free, although considerable gaseous vapor finds exit through it; but the Kentuck shaft is all right in that respect, the draft setting down it instead of up. Men go down and up these shafts with perfect freedom and impunity, and both mining companies are cooperating with each other in fighting the fire. They send both water and steam for that purpose down the Crown Point shaft, an all the caved debris, which is cleaned away in order to get at the fire, is taken out through the Kentuck shaft. The fire smolders among the filled-in waste and debris let down by the burned timbering, and its whereabouts is only indicated by the rising smoke and gas. Therefore, considering the very limited opportunities offered by drifts and tunnels, any experienced miner or person posted in such matters, can easily realize the difficulty of getting at the fire to any sort of advantage at all. It seems this evening to be somewhat more subdued than it was yesterday, or it is dying out for want of material.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket hoisting-works building is still closed to all outsiders, and since the killing of Williams, last Sunday night, from being lost off the cage in that shaft, while in a state of asphyxiation, nothing of any consequence has been done there. The air is good enough in all three of the mines below the 600 and 700-foot levels. The firemen and miners are working at the 700-foot level, but are occasionally made sick by the hot smoke and gas, but it is so bad at the 600-foot, that no one can survive there. At that level, in the Crown Point mine, is where four of the still unrecovered bodies lie; the other is yet at the 800-foot level of the Kentuck.</p><p>That Explosion.</p><p>You have read and heard a great deal about a great explosion of Giant powder or a lot of kegs of common blasting powder down there, but the most popular idea is that it was a great explosion of foul gas, which at once tilled every unfortunate miner within reach. No loud report is spoken of, but it is described as simply a sudden, quick, heavy puff of air, which blew out all the candles below, and came with considerable force up the shaft, visibly affecting the heavy cage hung in the mouth of it at the surface, and blowing dust and chips up towards the roof of the building overhead. Now, living here as I do, and this unfortunate affair in all its phases coming particularly within my line of business, I claim to be somewhat posted, or at least ought to be if I am not. The miners and officers of the mines—than whom there can be no better authority—tell me that there was no giant powder where that fire could reach it, and if there was it would simply burn up like so much wet sawdust, with no explosion at all. They also say there was no blasting powder within reach of the fire, and if there was, no one certainly smelt the inevitable smoke and stench of such explosion; neither would it have killed the men at the lower levels. Now, in regard to the gas explosion theory, I will give the following extracts on that point from an ably written article in the Art Supplement of Appleton's Journal:</p><p>A discharge of cannon loaded with canister shot, and fired point blank into a crowd; a powder magazine taking fire in the midst of a body of workmen; a gasometer exploding in a factory, can hardly give an idea of an explosion of fire damp suddenly overtaking the miner. The explosion spreads instantly into all the galleries of the mine—a roaring whirlwind of flaming air destroys everything it encounters, overthrowing trams, barricades, etc. The men are blinded, thrown down, scorched, and sometimes burned to a cinder; often their clothes taking fire, and not unfrequently they are buried beneath the ruins of the fallen roof. When an attempt is made to fly to their assistance, there is not time to rescue them—there are only corpses left which are scarcely recognizable. The calamity spares nobody, even though as many as one or two hundred miners may be at work—death extends over the whole mine where the explosive gas was present.""</p><p>I saw nearly every corpse which was taken out of these mines. Those taken out the first day were not even discolored, but looked as though they had merely fallen asleep. They were from the lower levels of the Yellow Jacket and Kentuck. Those subsequently recovered were distorted, swollen and discolored; but this was evidently owing wholly to the trying circumstances of their death, the hot, confined atmosphere, and similar natural causes. One thing is certain—not one of them had his hair, eyebrows or whiskers singed in the least.</p><p>My theory of this so-called explosion, supported by the opinions of practical men, is simply this: That fire, according to the testimony at the Coroner's inquest, had been burning four or five hours before it was fully discovered and the alarm given, consequently the timbers being burned allowed the entire mass of waste rock filled into the worked out space overhead, which they supported at that point, to give way and fall bodily, completely filling the space below that 800-foot level, where it was found that same day by the adventurous firemen and miners, and where it still remains. The effect of this cave, like all similar caves, was to drive the displaced air suddenly and forcibly before it. In some instances the air has been thus so forcibly expelled as to not only blow out all the lights, but also to blow men prostrate to the ground. In this instance it doubtless suddenly also expelled the foul, deadly smoke and gas which had been quietly generating during those hours since the fire commenced, driving it through the other drifts and passages with the suddenness which so unexpectedly overtook so many unfortunate victims. Then there was a consequent reaction and subsidence of the fatal gas after it had done its deadly work, allowing men to go down only a few hours afterwards and bring up the corpses with impunity. This theory may not be the correct one, but it is based upon fact and common sense, and that's pretty good. At any rate it will do until a better one is produced.</p><p>As to those vague, nonsensical rumors so prevalent, not only in your city but in other localities, that this fire was a put up job by certain interested parties for stock-speculating purposes, the idea is too diabolically absurd to merit even a passing notice from A. D.  </p>",public://sf-herald/SFH06.jpg,sf-herald
SFH07,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DAILY HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, April 27, 1869.</p><p>All About Imagination.</p><p>In the Gold Hill News of last evening the local editor refers to the statement contained in my letter of April 12th, that sixty kegs of blasting powder were sent down the Yellow Jacket shaft and placed in the Kentuck magazine the day before the late terrible disaster, characterizing it as ""wildly imaginative."" The principal editor of the News had previously alluded to my telegram of the same fact, but in language so indecent that I did not feel called upon to notice it.</p><p>As the last reference is courteous, I have simply to say, that my informant is a gentleman of the highest respectability, and that he also gave me the names of two other gentlemen who were present and could corroborate his statement. He told me that on the afternoon of April 6th he saw three cages, loaded with kegs of Santa Cruz blasting powder, sent down the west compartment of the Yellow Jacket shaft. While he did not county the kegs, his impression was that the number was about sixty; but certainly forty. That it went to the Kentuck magazine was, of course, a matter of conjecture only; but that naturally seemed the most probable place of deposit.</p><p>As a matter of course, like any other newspaper correspondent, considering my source of information perfectly reliable, I telegraphed and wrote the fact to THE HERALD, as I would have done any other item relative to the disaster, which came to my knowledge. I had no intention whatsoever of reflecting upon any of the officers of any of the mining companies concerned; but simply to give THE HERALD the benefit of such views as I could collect and deemed reliable. I know nothing about the amount of powder it is usual to keep on hand in the mines, or the amount of precaution customary; although, I confess, it seemed to me at the time that this was rather a large quantity, unless it was stored in some place of almost positive safety.</p><p>Since the mines were opened and investigations made, I am informed by a miner, who claims to have been present and seen the ruins, that the Kentuck magazine is blown to pieces. He also told me that there had been forty kegs of blasting powder and two boxes of giant powder there. I suppose he told me the truth; especially as it coincides so well with the other statement made to me by a gentleman whose veracity I know to be unimpeachable.</p><p>I confess I was very much surprised, and somewhat indignant, at the attack of the principal editor of the News. Not that it referred to me; for, if it concerned anybody, it was my informant. I could but wonder why all this vituperation at the announcement of a fact involving no criminality, nor perhaps even any carelessness. My wonder was still farther increased when a very distinguished and well-known citizen of Virginia, himself introducing the conversation, informed me ""that certain parties were very sensitive on the subject of powder, in connection with the disaster; and he could not account for it."" As the Gold Hill News has never, I believe, or but occasionally at most, alluded to the fact of there having been an explosion just preceding the alarm, which had force sufficient to raise the cage at the Crown Point shaft one or two feet, although weighing eleven hundred pounds; as it never published the general testimony taken before the Coroner, highly interesting as it is, but left it to the Herald to make known to the News' readers what the sworn facts relative to the calamity were, where nearly every witness speaks of the explosion—the one nearest the point of fire and saved from death with the most difficulty, averring that he smelt no smoke but only felt the effects of a blast—I think the gentleman referred to had some reason for his surprise. It was doubtless much more convenient, as I have observed has been invariably the case here whenever mining accidents have occurred, to lay the blame, if there be, at the door of the poor toilers who daily risk life and limb in resting wealth from the bowels of the earth, of which they receive but a hard earned pittance. They are not advertisers and it is safer to place on their heads the origin of any misadventure than to even unintentionally and by chance cast the slightest shadow of a shade upon those who, by virtue of position, can be of pecuniary benefit.</p><p>Therefore it is gravely printed that the fire undoubtedly was caused by a candle being left resting against a post by some careless miner; and this in the face of the sworn statement before the Coroner, that there were no candles anywhere in the vicinity.</p><p>Should any one desire to read really ""wildly imaginative"" literature in connection with this catastrophe, I recommend them to that portion of a late Gold Hill letter to THE HERALD, which estimates the damage to the Crown Point and Kentuck as nothing; and that to the Yellow Jacket as covered by a few hundred dollars and a couple of days' shoveling.</p><p>Probable Origin of the Fire.</p><p>I had not intended ever writing my opinion of the origin of the fire in the mines, but leave it to be judged from the developed facts. I believe I will change my mind and give my theory for what it is worth, with the others being put.</p><p>I would premise by saying that the draft at or near the supposed point of fire has always been so strong, since the three mines were connected, that it would blow a man's hat off. To use candles there at all it was necessary to place them in a box. This, of itself, ought to effectually dispose of the fire-damp theory.</p><p>If it was an ordinary fire, how happened it that almost in an instant three or four levels, running many hundreds of feet, with innumerable side drifts and winzes, and three large shafts, became filled with smoke and gas so dense and suffocating as to at once, as it were, extinguish life? If the posts and logging were in flames, why was it that the smoke, gas or vapor (call it which ever you will) which issued from the Crown Point shaft the whole of the first day had a light, hazy appearance, like steam or mist, while thenceforth it was as black as night? Why was it that a person could not inhale it even for a few moments without experiencing nausea and violent pains in the head, lasting some for hours?</p><p>My idea is, and always has been, that the giant powder contained in the Kentuck magazine ignited spontaneously and slowly smoldered, generating quantities of gas sufficient to fill the adjacent drifts, and the vilest and most poisonous exhalation that can be imagined, as any one who has ever come in contact with it confined will testify—besides probably setting fire to the timbering, until the blasting-powder was reached, the explosion of which instantly forced this atmosphere of death throughout the three mines</p><p>""Alas ! for the Rarity of Christian Charity.""</p><p>The press here have seen fit, in recent issues, to highly laud the ""generosity"" of San Francisco towards those who have been thrown upon our charity by the Gold Hill disaster, whose numbers have now been ascertained to be much greater than was at first supposed.</p><p>From their praise I respectfully beg leave to dissent. To my mind, San Francisco, in this matter, has neither been munificent nor even liberal, but quite the contrary.</p><p>She has contributed so far about $4,000, truly an immense sum for the metropolis of the Pacific, whose estimated wealth is counted at two hundred millions. There is scarcely a little New England town where a larger sum could not be raised under similar circumstances.</p><p>Of her donation nearly one-half comes from the brokers; the balance, except a few hundreds from private individuals, from the efforts of college students, and those of members of the theatrical profession, who are always in the van to offer their aid in behalf of misfortune. To them be all honor.</p><p>Neither the banks, merchants nor incorporated companies of the Bay City have given anything that I am aware of. And, greatest shame of all, in a Christian land (if I am rightly informed), not a dollar has been collected or attempted to be collected at any of the many churches in your city, to aid the widow and the orphan.</p><p>Stock Excitement.</p><p>The recent strike in the Norcross, and the continued improvement in the appearance of several other mines, has greatly elated the community here, and everything bids fair for a most prosperous summer, so far as the stock market is concerned. The excitement is constantly on the increase, as shares keep going steadily up, and the crowds around the brokers' offices make one think of the good old times.</p><p>C.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH07.jpg,sf-herald
SFH08,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DAILY HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.), April 29th—8 P. M.</p><p>Running Again.</p><p>I am happy to be able to state that work is again commenced in the three recently disabled mines of Gold Hill—the three principal bullion producing mines. A temporary drift connection was yesterday made through the caved debris in the east ledge, at the 700-foot level, allowing a free draft of air from the Yellow Jacket mine, through the Kentuck and out of the Crown Point shaft, just as it used to be before the great disaster. This directly had the expected effect to free the Yellow Jack entirely of foul air and also the Kentuck to a great extent. They commenced hoisting ore again from the upper levels of the Kentuck last night, after a lapse of over three weeks, and the work has recommenced in the Yellow Jacket mine this morning, clearing out waste and caved debris, and cleaning up generally , preparatory to hoisting ore, which they will commence doing to-morrow. As to the Crown Point, the air is too bad for mining operations just yet; a strong current of hot, gaseous, smoky vapor is pouring out through the shaft, and men can work down in the mine but a short time without getting sick, or having to come out for fresh air. They are re-timbering the burnt portion of the 700-foot station. The air is fast improving, and the prospects are that regular mining operations will be recommenced in the Crown Point, also, within the next day or two.</p><p>The Fire</p><p>Appears to be entirely extinguished, unless it may be that a little still smolders among the caved debris of the east ledge, assisting to keep the air bad for a short time longer. Its principal ravages seem to have been in the Kentuck and Crown Point. The Yellow Jacket escaped with slight damage, but the Kentuck evidently fared the worst of the three. Neither mine, however, has sustained any very permanent damage. The terrible loss of human life is by far the worst feature in this distressing calamity.</p><p>Another Body Recovered.</p><p>The body of George Edwards was taken form a drift between the 600 and 500-foot levels of the Kentuck mine on Tuesday afternoon. The body was discovered the day before, but the fatal gas of the mine was so bad that the men could not safely stay long enough to remove the corpse; but subsequently some lime was sent down and thrown upon it, in order to destroy the effluvia as much as possible. Singular as it may appear, when the body was finally moved to the surface, it was found to be but little decomposed, in fact was quite firm, and easily handled and had but little offensive stench about it. It had lost considerably in weight, however. What combination of gases or conditions of the hot, damp steam-permeated atmosphere in that deep, dark tomb, over 500 feet down in the bosom of the earth, thus preserved this human body, I leave for the consideration of those more versed in chemical science. Deceased was about thirty-five years of age; and his funeral took place yesterday. Together with Daniel O'Neil, Thomas Laity and A. Reinay, Edwards was thought to be at the 600-foot level, but he had evidently sought refuge or escape by climbing through the stope floors and drifts above. A pretty thorough search has failed to discover the other bodies, and they may eventually be found buried beneath some caved portion of the mine. The body of Martin Cloony is still in the 800-foot level of the Kentuck.</p><p>A Grievous Wrong.</p><p>Your Virginia correspondent has committed, and apparently still persists in a very strange, unreasonable, and indeed wicked perversion of the real truth, regarding the so-called explosion in the mines at the time the fire was fully discovered and the miners were frantically endeavoring to escape with their lives. And his misrepresentations, I perceive, have even led you into almost an indorsement of his views in your editorial columns. The HERALD has its influence, and is extensively circulated and read here; consequently when your editorial of last Saturday morning, headed ""Topics of the Day"" was read, it naturally created much remark, and as it very seriously affected the integrity of the officers of the mines in question, they could not fail to seriously consider it. I quote the following from the editorial aforesaid:</p><p>""The cause alleged for recent destruction of life in the mines at Gold Hill—as given by our correspondent—was undoubtedly the real explanation of the tragedy. Under date of the 21st our correspondent writes from Virginia City: 'investigations in the Kentuck corroborate my statement about the powder. The Kentuck magazine was blown to pieces; and a miner, who saw the ruins and informed me about it, stated that, at the time of the disaster, there were forty kegs of blasting powder and two boxes of giant powder in the vaults. As to the ""sixty kegs"" reported to have been sent down a short time before the disaster, I have two good, reliable witnesses to the fact, and the companies dare not deny it. You will never see a statement direct of this fact in either of the papers published in this county; but it is in vain that they deny the truth of the statement.' We do not understand why the officers of the companies should feel sensitive about the facts appearing.""</p><p>Now, then, I am fully authorized, in the names of each and every one of the resident officers of the Yellow Jacket, Kentuck and Crown Point mines, including Presidents, Superintendents, Secretaries, Foremen, underground or above, and everybody else in authority in or about those mines, to deny in toto every word and every line of the above quotation. According to their best knowledge and belief, that Virginia correspondent has not been down here at the scene of the disaster since the first dat. At any rate they are charitably willing to believe so, and the aforesaid writer only obtained his information through floating, idle rumors or perverse stories told him by irresponsible individuals.</p><p>In the first place, it is an absurdity to suppose that a magazine of powder is kept down in any of the mines of the Comstock, amid the usual dampness. The magazines of the three mines in question, as I stated in my last letter, are at or near the surface, many hundreds of feet away from where the fire was, and the powder stored in them is still there. The Kentuck magazine is in the hoisting works of the mine, above the surface. The sort of cupboard down at the 600-foot level of the mine, where a little powder for present use was sometimes temporarily kept, together with fuse, candles, gads, and other articles, and which is doubtless the ""magazine"" that correspondent refers to, still remains there wholly unscathed. There was in it at the time of the fire about half a keg of common blasting powder, and three or four pounds of Giant powder, but this was removed unexploded last Saturday.</p><p>There was one keg of powder in the 600-foot level, but the fire did not go within 150 feet of it, and there it still remains in a rather damp condition. There was no other powder in the Kentuck mine. In the Yellow Jacket all the powder there was below was at the 900-foot or lower level, where blasting was actively being carried on. There was six and a half kegs of it, but this was all safely taken out the first evening, after the bodies of the miners at that level were recovered, and subsequently placed in the magazine of the mine, where it still is. In the Crown Point there were three cans of powder—perhaps ten pounds in all—but neither of them were where the fire went. They are still there, and pretty well steamed. Not an ounce of powder exploded in either of the mines. In conclusion, those mining officers are only ""sensitive"" about the untruths which have appeared; and if your Virginian correspondent will only take pleasure in showing him the facts and true points in the case, just as I have related them.</p><p>A.

SFH09,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.), May 7, 1869</p><p>To-Morrow.</p><p>All Gold Hill and Virginia are agog with high-flown patriotic anticipations relative to what the morrow is supposed to bring forth. The great silver spike of Nevada—which, together with the golden spike of California, are supposed to fasten the last two ends of the last two rail to the last tie, and thus complete the great Continental railroad connection—was hammered out and forwarded to the front yesterday, and Liberty Engine Company, No. 1, of Gold Hill, and Washoe Engine Company, No. 4, of Virginia, have both gone down to Sacramento with their machines to-day, in order to join in the grand celebration of to-morrow. The telegraph operators of Gold Hill and Virginia have also made arrangements to have the clicks of the telegraph, which are to correspond with each stroke of the hammer that drives home that ""last spoke,"" transmitted to their offices simultaneously, and when the lightning shall say that the great national work is done, each office will send up a flag as a signal to be responded to by every bell, steam whistle, cannon or other noise-producing arrangement which can be turned loose on that interesting occasion. Old Washoe will be heard some about that time, and I doubt very much whether there is another locality on the face of the globe that will or can make more noise than Storey county when she sets out.</p><p>The Disabled Mines.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket mine is all right now, and yielding at a very satisfactory rate. The drifts and all other points of connection with the Kentuck and Crown Point mines are tightly and effectively closed, therefore all fire, smoke or mineral gas is shut out, and the air is good throughout the mine. Fire being discovered burning and increasing in the Kentuck and Crown Point mines last Monday, driving all the miners out, both shafts were tightly closed and have remained so ever since. Strong gaseous smoke still issues from the covering of the Crown Point shaft, inducing the belief that fire still exists in the mining depths, therefore, both these mines will probably be kept closed some days longer. Meanwhile, opportunity is taken to repair and fix up machinery, etc., ready for active operations when mining work is again resumed. May that be soon, is the prayer of not only all the stockholders, but of the hundreds of miners thrown out of employment.</p><p>Paul & Wood's Process.</p><p>Last Tuesday I was present at a trial of Paul & Wood's Electric Process for the amalgamation of gold and silver ores. Mr. Almarin B. Paul, one of the inventors and patentees of that new process, and well known throughout this section as an old resident, and the pioneer mill-man of Gold Canyon, himself superintended the trial, which was conducted at the old Ione mill, a short distance above Silver City; and there were also present quite a number of the principal superintendents of mills and mines from Virginia, Gold Hill, and other localities. I will not attempt a minute description of Paul & Wood's process, for that is already familiar enough in your columns; but will treat it incidentally as I come to it. The ore worked was from the Twin mine, Silver City, containing principally fine gold; but it answered very well by way of illustrating the capabilities of the process. It was first put through the five-stamp dry crushing battery of the mill, coming through the screen in rather a coarse state. Each stamp weighs 650 pounds, and the battery is capable of crushing eight tons per day dry, or twelve tons by the usual wet process. The dry pulp, received in a big box, was next shoveled into a large circular grinder, or revolving barrel, five feet in diameter and three feet in length. This barrel, or drum, is of heavy boiler iron, with cast iron heads, and a trap door in the side to shovel the pulp into. Six hundred and fifty pounds of this dry pulp, or ore meal, constitutes a charge; and with it about 2,000 pounds of cast iron buttons, an inch in diameter, and weighing about an ounce each are shut inside the barrel, which is then revolved at the rate of twenty-five revolutions per minute. This creates a very effective grinding action, for in forty minutes the ore is reduced to an impalpable powder, like super-fine flour, and is screened separate from the buttons by a very simple operation. This ore is then shoveled into Paul & Woods' amalgamator, which is simply a barrel of heavy boiler iron, with cast-iron heads, revolving horizontally like the previous one, and surrounded by a sort of furnace casing, wherein, on a grate beneath, a fire was built in order to create the requisite degree of heat. A small aperture at one end allowed of the introduction of the floured ore, and by means of a proper cove the hole was shut up tight. This barrel is 38 inches long, and revolves at the rate of 26 revolutions per minute. 1,000 pounds of the pulverized ore constitutes a charge, to which is added one-third its eight of quicksilver. After revolving four hours with a gentle heat, not enough to vaporize the mercury, the charge is withdrawn, and so very intimately is the quicksilver found to be mixed with the pulp that it is not perceivable with the naked eye, yet by simple agitation in water, it is settled and collected with the greatest imaginary facility, what appeared to be nothing but a dry powder thus yielding an ounce or two of bright, lively quicksilver in a horn spoon, by less than a minute's washing.</p><p>Nothing could be more thoroughly subdivided and perfectly disseminated than was this quicksilver throughout the pulp; and, as a natural consequence, it sought out and amalgamated with every particle of the precious metal therein contained, and with which it had all the stronger affinity by reason of the frictional electricity evolved by the revolutions of the barrel and the gentle heat of the fire. The beauty of the system is that no slums are allowed to run to waste, but the whole is more thoroughly searchingly and completely amalgamated than by any other process yet discovered. Neither is there any waste at all of quicksilver—something that can hardly be said of the common wet process. From this excellent revolving amalgamator the merecurialized pulp is taken and put into a large settler, which together with the revolving amalgamator, constitutes the new portion of the process, although that button barrel grinder is quite a novelty of itself, but it has been in use at that mill for some time. The settler is seven feet across by two and a half feet deep, circular, with wooden sides. The bottom is covered by a copper plate, and the pulp being diluted with plenty of water containing chemicals, constantly stirred by the usual slowly revolving arms for four hours—the same time required for the amalgamation. On top of the water floats a cover just filling the surface, on the under side of which is a zinc plate, between which and the copper plate at the bottom a constant current of electricity is induced by the action of the chemicals, gradually and completely attracting and settling all the little particles of the quicksilver, together with the precious metals on the copper bottom. The slum is then run off totally worthless.</p><p>Suggestive.</p><p>So much for Paul & Wood's Electric Process. Mr. Paul claims for it that by it he can work all kinds of ore with the greatest facility, even the most intractable, and however rebelliously charged they may be with base metals; and Comstock ores, he says, he will work up to 92 per cent. of the fire assay of the same. With that little barrel at the Ione mill he can work three tons a day; but the capacity of work, of course, could be much increased by larger barrels or more of them. Taking the dry-crushed pulverized ore, just as it is before it goes into Paul's barrel, and amalgamating and settling it instead, by the usual wet process, it can be made to yield nearly as high a percentage as by Paul's process; therefore, it is merely a matter of figuring as to machinery and men required, capital involve, amount of ore worked, and cost of increased yield, in determining the true merits of Paul & Wood's Electric Process. We, in common with all who witnessed its operation, were much pleased with it, and shall contemplate its future history and developed successes with the liveliest interest.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH09.jpg,sf-herald
SFH10,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL, (Nev.) May 16—8 P. M.</p><p>Sunday.</p><p>It is Sunday here at Gold Hill, same as in other portions of the Christian world, and we observe the day just as faithfully as any community where love—of God and love of the almighty dollar are ever contending with each other for the supremacy. A great many Gold Hillers go to church Sundays, and a great many more don't. We haven't got civilized up to the point, yet, of ""shutting down"" all the whiskey mills, any more than we do the quartz mills, but we keep on drinking and pounding away Sundays, same as we do week days. Even the faro banks are kept running, if anything, brisker than ever that day, owing to some men trying to observe the Sabbath by not working. Do you know, now, I just think it is a good thing that the mines and mills are kept running Sundays, for it keeps lots of men out of mischief. Earle, the great revivalist, when he was over here a couple of years ago, made quite a strong move in favor of having all the mills and mines shut down on Sundays, evidently under the delusion that the workmen and miners would all rush to hear him exhort; but, fortunately, that calamitous move was ineffectual.</p><p>Why, bless his dear old soul, if they didn't pass the day agreeably in some saloon playing ""pitch seven-up"" for the drinks, or skirmishing around the faro table, they would hire a horse or a cart, and go out for a day's sport in the country. They would hardly be cooped up in a meeting house after being cooped up in a mine or mill all the week. Of course, there are a few honorable exceptions, as for instance, one friend of mine, who used to work in the Gould and curry. He put in all the working time he could, even working over hours, thus averaging eight days in a week, at four dollars per day; the consequence was that being totally unvitiated by outside demoralizing influences, his mind became of a morally reflective turn and he was easily persuaded to become a convert under Brother Earle, and has remained steadfast and true ever since. He goes to church regularly every Sunday, and never works, swears or behaves any way unchristianlike, only week days. I am fully persuaded that working Sundays was what fetched him, and that otherwise he would have remained a stray scalawag of a sheep, roaming outside the fold of the Lord forevermore. 'Tis well.</p><p>The ""Last Spike.""</p><p>While on this little religious dissertation I must tell you what Brother B—, a sort of traveling jour preacher, got off last Monday. A lot of us were rejoicing and congratulating together over the glorious news just telegraphed that the last spike was driven, completing the great Continental railroad connection, when B—chimed in with his sonorous, exhortive voice. Says he: ""My friends, do not dwell with such exceeding joy over the driving of that last spike, but oh ! my dear brethren, just think of the great day that is fast drawing near, when the last trumpet shall sound, and Jesus Christ himself, from the summit of Mount Calvary shall telegraph to all the world that he has risen indeed, and come to rule amid all power, peace and glory over the great kingdom, descended to him from his Almighty Father. Then shall all nations bow before him and join in one universal shout of jubilee. Then, and not till then will the last spike be driven; a spike compared with which this little one will be no more than a carpet-tack or a shoe-peg.""</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>Through a really awkward and provoking misunderstanding as to the proper and true time for celebrating that last spike driving, we had no fair show, and did but little in the way of public demonstration on that eventful occasion. A few guns were fired, and steam-whistles blown, and in the evening there was a faint attempt at fireworks and illumination; that's all, in either Gold Hill or Virginia; but just you wait till this fall, when the Virginia and Truckee Railroad is completed, and you will hear of a celebration in this quarter, quite probably. Our Gold Hill and Virginia firemen were so well treated by the Sacramento firemen at the late big celebration, that they propose inviting them, in return, to come up here on that special occasion, and be treated in the very gayest and most luxurious Washoe style. Within the last day or two several wooden buildings, at the upper end of the town, where the railroad will cross Main street, have been removed, and grading will be prosecuted at this point forthwith. A large force of men were put to work yesterday grading a wagon road along the south side of Fort Homestead Hill, in order to haul away the waste from the tunnel to be commenced at that point, there being no good place for a dump at the mouth of it. The other end of the tunnel is already in some distance. The tunnel at American Flat, and the other tunnels between here and Virginia are progressing admirably, and a large portion of the grading between here and Carson is already completed ready for the ties and rails. The first spike will be driven pretty soon.</p><p>May Flowers.</p><p>Wild flowers are beginning to show themselves upon the hillsides, but they are not distinguished for either variety or great beauty. The blossoms of the wild peach are the prettiest, and sheep, goats and cows are very fond of them. The principal floral glory is not in bloom yet, but will be in a few days. It grows on a dwarf mullein stalk, is all yellow, and about the size of a dinner plate. The sage brush looks healthy. It has put forth a fresh coat of green leaves, and looks refreshing.</p><p>Return Current.</p><p>The White Piners are coming back about as fast as they went. The Inland Empire says as high as sixty-five persons left Hamilton in a single day for Elko and westward. One reason for such an exodus is that Wells, Fargo & Co. have put the fare down to $5, by their stages, between the two points, or $40 50 through to Virginia. Another reason is that several hundreds of anxious dwellers in that famous Silverado have become sufficiently chlorided, and finding the ""poor man's paradise"" not all it promised, they are anxious to get back to the white settlements, where there is something tangible to tie to. The truth of the matter is that it is a rough country for any one at the present time, and possessed of few attractions in the way of home comforts, yet it most certainly does contain some very rich ore indeed. The extent of it is very limited, not withstanding all interested representations to the contrary; and all that has been discovered thus far would not support one twentieth part that has crowded in there. As it stands now, it is a goo country enough for a few people; what the future may develop remains to be seen.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Howson Opera Concert and Burlesque Troupe played all last week to large and fashionable audiences, at Piper's Opera House, Virginia. Their engagement closes next Wednesday evening. August Siegrist appears next—the wonderful wire rider, who telegraphs himself through the air on a velocipede. If there were no insulators to bother him, he might, perhaps, make pretty good time between here and the Atlantic States on the Overland telegraph wire. After Siegrist has circulated himself a couple of nights, the Opera House will close for about a week, or until Hartz, the Illusionist, arrives. Hartz will draw good houses.</p><p>The Disabled Mines.</p><p>As I stated in my last letter, all drifts or other passages connecting the Yellow Jacket with Kentuck and Crown Point mines are tightly and effectually closed, in order to shut out all possible fire communicating from the other mines. This, of course has the effect to stop all circulation of air, and no fresh air goes from the surface down into the mine, except what is forced down through the long tube of the patent blowing-machine. This goes down to the lower, or 900 and 800-foot levels, and from there considerable ore of a rich quality is daily yielded. The other parts of the mine, the upper levels especially, are too hot and filled with foul air to allow of men working, therefore only about half the force usually employed in the mine are working. The Crown Point and Kentuck shafts are still tightly closed, and but little is being done about the hoisting works of either mine. Both companies are improving the opportunity to repair machinery, put on new cables, etc., in readiness for active operations as soon as the mines shall be reopened. When that will be, no one seems to know at present; probably some time next week, however, as there is but little if any gaseous smoke issuing from the Crown Point shaft to indicate that fire still exists in the mining depths. These three principal mines being thus disabled has a very apparent and depressing effect upon business of all kinds, but here and at Virginia, as four or five hundred men are thrown out of employment, and many thousands of dollars out of monthly circulation. ""Pay-day"" does not come now.</p><p>Sinking Deeper.</p><p>During the past week the Imperial and Empire companies have been cleaning out the slum or waste matter settled in the sump or bottom of their deep new shaft, and otherwise preparing to sink deeper. They never made a better move, and the only fault to find with them is that they did not do it sooner. At both the 1,000 and 1,100 foot levels from this shaft they have drifted clear through to the west wall, and by means of side drifts and cross cuts they have prospected the vein pretty thoroughly, but failed altogether in finding anything more encouraging than barren quartz and porphyry. The shaft is cleaned out and they will most probably start sinking to-morrow. It is 1,104 feet deep now, and the bottom of it is just cutting the east clay wall of the Comstock. As the ledge maintains its present established dip or inclination of forty-five degrees to the east it will take about 200 feet deeper of sinking perpendicularly before the west wall is reached. In that distance surely the barren belt should be passed and good deposits of ore developed. There is every reason to believe that the same good body of ore found at the lower levels of the Yellow Jacket will be intersected by this shaft; at any rate, it will prospect the ledge at that point far more thoroughly than by any other possible means, and as the lower levels of the mines generally along the old Comstock are looking exceedingly well, there is certainly hope yet for this.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH10.jpg,sf-herald
SFH11,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.), May 23, 1869</p><p>Wintry.</p><p>The months apportioned to the winter season are long since passed, but ""now is the winter of our discontent made manifest"" by some of about as mean, scandalous weather as any Christian country was afflicted with; snow, rain, sunshine, hail, squalls, big thunder clouds and blue sky, all mixed in the most exasperatingly disagreeable manner imaginable. The ""oldest inhabitant,"" as usual, never saw the like before, although something similar in the weather line always occurs here about this time. The roads everywhere are fearfully muddy, and from Reno to Virginia the road is said to be as bad as at any time last winter, delaying the stages last evening an hour or so.</p><p>Strange Freak of Lightning.</p><p>The queerest occurrence in the lightning line anybody here ever knew of happened at Lower Gold Hill last Monday afternoon, during the prevalence of a heavy thunder storm. The lightning struck the Empire Boarding house, apparently striking the ground outside first, and then coming up under the house, through the floor, exactly beneath where Mr. Frank Deville was standing. It tore a foot and a half across in the floor, throwing the splinters up to the ceiling of the room. Deville was knocked down, and stunned for a minute or so. The boots were torn violently from his feet, and even the legs of his pantaloons torn to shreds. Both feet were terribly lacerated, portions of the leather of his boots being driven into them. His surgeon has since been obliged to remove a piece of broken bone from one foot, two or three inches in length. It will be a long time before he will be able to walk. A window near him was totally demolished, sash and all, and the other windows in the room were more or less broken; his brother who was within a few feet of him was also knocked down, but not injured. Various theories having been propounded as to how this really odd flash of the lightning could have transpired, I have a right to follow suit. The floor upon which Mr. Deville stood was a double one, and he stood between a stove and a window. He was within three feet of the stove. It is a well established fact that wherever lightning meets with resistance, an explosion or something very demonstrative is the result. Hence it is quite reasonable to suppose that the electric current, attracted by the stove pipe above the roof, passed down it until finding in the body of Deville a preferred conductor, it passed through him to the floor, where meeting with the resistance occasioned by lack of a further conductor, an explosion beneath his feet was the result. In support of this idea, the upper part of the doubt floor was splintered upward while the lower part was splintered downward.</p><p>Accidental.</p><p>A large number of accidents, both great and small, have occurred during the past week, one resulting fatally and two others perhaps so. The first was that of Jas. Bawden, a miner, who last Friday fell about seventy feet in the shaft of the Justice-Independent mine and was so badly injured that he survived only a few hours; both legs and both arms were broken and he sustained other terrible injuries. About the same time A. J. Praedir, a Portuguese, while assisting to tear down an old reservoir in Gold Canon, just below the Piute mill, had his head badly jammed and fractured by a heavy stick of timber. He was still alive at last accounts, with but small hopes of recovery. Mrs. J. P. Cutler, who was thrown out of a buggy on South C street, Virginia, last Tuesday, while riding with her husband, by the sudden breaking of the king-bolt and consequent uncoupling of the buggy, is still alive, but having sustained a severe concussion of the brain, she was a long time insensible. Being also in a delicate condition, her nervous system sustained a very great shock, and her recovery is considered doubtful.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Howsons concluded their very successful engagement at Piper's Opera House on Thursday evening, with a benefit, which was very fully and fashionably attended. They are going to take still another public complimentary benefit next Tuesday evening, at Athletic Hall, after which they leave for a trip overland to the Atlantic States, stopping to perform an engagement at Salt Lake. Young Siegrist, with his aerial velocipede, appeared last evening at the Opera House to the poorest audience of the season. He repeats to-night. Hartz, the Illusionist, opens at that theatre for six nights, commencing on Tuesday evening. Mr. James Stark is still confined to his room at the International, slowly recovering from his severe paralytic stroke. He can speak but little as yet, and suffers now severely from salivation. Whether this salivation will prove his salvation remains to be seen.</p><p>Relief Subscriptions.</p><p>The subscriptions to the relief fund for the sufferers by the recent terrible calamity in the mines of Gold Hill, thus far received, amount to $10,698, of which $3,225 is from California, and the balance from the citizens of various parts of this State. As no more seems to be coming in, it is fair to presume that the generous flow has ceased. What has been subscribed, however, is fully sufficient to place all the sufferers beyond the reach of want, and even surround them with home comforts.</p><p>The Disabled Mines.</p><p>The shafts of the Kentuck and Crown Point were reopened last Tuesday; also the drift connecting the Yellow Jacket with these two mines, at the 900-foot level. This gave the Yellow Jacket plenty of good air at the lower levels, as there is a strong draft southward, and also sent clouds of hot, foul, steamy vapor pouring up through the Crown Point and Kentuck shafts. On Thursday the body of Martin Clooney was found in the Crown Point shaft. He was the last of the Kentuck men, and had made his way through from the 800-foot level of that mine to this shaft, where he fell a distance of 200 feet, landing on a scaffolding in the shaft. His remains were a mere mass of bones and clothes, with little or no flesh, and he was identified simply by what he wore, and his watch. The bodies still remaining unrecovered are those of Daniel O'Neil, A. Reinay and Thomas Laity—all Crown Point miners.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket is working about half its former force of men taking out ore. The Kentuck is yielding ore enough to supply the Sunderland mill. Nothing has been done at the Crown Point mine, however, in the way of extracting ore, for the air is too bad, and several men, nearly every day, have been asphyxiated by contact with the foul gas in trying to work below. They were busy yesterday laying a long wooden box, or air conductor, from the Yellow Jacket line, through the 900-foot level to the Crown Point shaft, in order to allow the Yellow Jacket a free draft of air, and yet not allow it to circulate upwards among the workings of the Crown Point and Kentuck, for from the increase of gaseous smoke apparent yesterday, It was more than suspected that fire still existed somewhere. I hope in all mercy the fire is extinguished, for it has been, and still is, rough on human flesh and blood. If it still burns, perhaps the best way would be to quit trying to mother it, give it all the fresh air and assistance possible, and let it burn itself out, and make a speedy finish of its infernal work.</p><p>New Safety arrangements.</p><p>I visited the Belcher, one of the most southerly of our Gold Hill mines, yesterday afternoon, in order to take a look at a new safety cage and a set of safety shaft gates they have just put in use. The cage is not made on any new principle, but the workmanship of it is the best I have yet seen in this section and highly creditable to Mr. William Bray, the head blacksmith at the Belcher hoisting works, whose skilled hand did the work. Similar cages are in use at the Crown Point, Chollar-Potosi and other mines along the Comstock, and they appear to be the most effective of any. Near the top of the iron cage frame, on either side, is a pair of oblong, or rather eccentric wheels, between which pass the heavy wooden guides for the cage, extending from top to bottom of the shaft. On the inner segment of each wheel, next to the guide, is a series of stout, sharp teeth or cogs, about an inch in length, which are kept from coming in contact with the guide by means of stout steel springs attached to the axle of the wheels, which extend across the top of the cage, from one side to the other, and also by the strain of the cable. In case the hoisting cable should break, the springs would act at once, causing the axles with the eccentric wheels to revolve just enough to force them to grip the guides, and dig those stout teeth, or pointed cogs, into the wood each side, and instantly arrest the downward progress of the cage; the heavier the load upon it, the stronger being the grip of the safety wheels. In order to exhibit the complete working of this new cage, Robert Ross, foreman of the mine, and Mr. Bray, the maker of the cage, got upon it as it hung suspended in the mouth of the shaft, and another man cut the cable. The effect was instantaneous, the cage only dropping one inch and a quarter, when it hung firm and perfectly secure. Without the safety arrangement it would have fallen, with its human freight, to swift and sure destruction, 850 feet to the bottom of the shaft.</p><p>The Safety Gates.</p><p>These were invented by Mr. Daniel Grant, the head carpenter of the works, and he has applied for a patent for the same. They are simply a pair of small gates, or iron doors, hung to posts at each side of the shaft entrance, which always remain closed, except when the cage is up, thus preventing the accidental or inadvertent running of a car into the open shaft when the cage is not there to receive it. A stout spring cam at each side of the shaft keep the gates closed; but the cage, in coming up, presses against the cams, and these, by means of  connecting rods, push the gates open. A short time ago a carman happened, by mistake, to run a car into the wrong compartment of this shaft, where the cage was not up, and, of course, down it went, occasioning a damage of over $300. He could not do the thing now. Similar gates can be fitted to every station in the mine, which is not the case with other inventions of the sort now in use at some of the shafts along the Comstock. Honor to Daniel Grand and William Bray for their life and property saving handiwork. I like to record all such instances of practical ingenuity.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH11.jpg,sf-herald
SFH12,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL (Nev.), June 3, 1869.</p><p>Signs of the Times.</p><p>In this, as well as all other well regulated communities, there are plenty of people who are always croaking about ""dull times."" Let things generally be ever so brisk, still they don't seem to ""see it"" or appreciate true prosperity when they find it. They are always speaking deprecatingly of the present as compared with the lively times of '63, or some other period of the past, never realizing that times are really good enough even now, if they would only bring their mind up to a due appreciation of the fact. How readily would they agree with me in saying that Gold Hill and Virginia never looked so dull as now—that the bottom had dropped out of the Comstock, and another year would see sagebrush growing in the streets; and yet how readily will they all see the point and agree with me now, when I say that Gold Hill and Virginia are more prosperous and possessed of better and more substantial present and future prospects than for five or six years past. The bottom of the old Comstock, so far from dropping out, is just now looking finer than ever, as witness the lower levels of the Yellow Jacket, Hale & Norcross, Savage, Chollar-Potosi and other noted mines. White Pine carried off a large portion of our floating population, which was really no loss; but even those who floated off in that direction have over half floated back again. In fact, our prosperity has, of necessity, to be rather of a regular order, as the monthly yield of our mines is about the same year by year. Just so many men find regular employment, and, consequently, just so much money has to be disbursed on the first of every month in the way of wages, salaries, etc. And all of this money is expended right here among us. The only serious drawback we have met with this season was the terrible calamity in the Crown Point, Kentuck and Yellow Jacket mines; but we have nearly recovered from that. The streets are constantly lively with people, passing teams, etc., and all places of evening amusement are well patronized. The circus, Opera House, and even the hurdy houses, all have full audiences. The merchants all speak of doing a good average business, and as new saloons are being started almost daily, there appears to be but little to complain of in that line, although they surely cannot all be getting rich.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>In regard to our disabled mines I have but little news to report. The Yellow Jacket is all right and running a full force of men, tumbling out the ore at a very lively and satisfactory rate. The air is good throughout every part of the mine. The Kentuck is only getting out ore enough from the upper levels to supply the Sunderland mill. The Crown Point is unproductive at present, but they are actively drifting east at the two lower levels for the ledge; when they tap it, good ore will doubtless be found, and far beneath the burning region, which is above the 900 foot level near the line of the Kentuck. From the 900-foot level to the surface, every station is tightly blocked up in order to smother and confine the fire which is considered to be still burning, and may continue for months. No important developments in the way of pay ore are made recently in the other mines of Gold Hill. The Imperial yields about 130 tons of good ore per day from the upper levels, but the two lower levels show no sign of promise. The bottom of the shaft is on porphyry. They are mining a drift south from the Empire, at the 1,000-foot level, to prospect the claims in that direction at a lower depth than yet attained in either of them. The North American and the Overman are both yielding goodly quantities of fair milling ore, but no rich and extensive bodies of it are encountered at present. The Chollar-Potosi, Hale and Norcross, and the Savage are all three turning out huge quantities of high grade ore, and the lower levels are especially promising. The Gould & Curry shaft develops nothing good at the bottom as yet. The drift west, at the 700-foot level of the Ophir, is now in about 330 feet from the shaft, and the face is in hard blasting rock; but judging from its more favorable character and other indications, the front ledge of the mine cannot be far distant. The Virginia Consolidated Company, being a combination of the claims lying on the Comstock, between the Ophir and Gould & Curry, have commenced a large new shaft between E and F streets, and it is now about twenty feet deep. Ross & Co. have the contract for sinking the first 500 feet, and are actively at it.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada.</p><p>This famous mine is again mildly intruding itself upon the attention of the public, from its remarkably good yield of gold bullion. The clean-up for the last half-month's run yielded eighty pounds of retorted amalgam, being considerably better than any one anticipated, and the yield for the present month will be even better, for richer ore will be worked. The supply of this rich surface ore seems literally inexhaustible, and Mr. Smith, the Superintendent, finds his prospecting labors continually rewarded with the development of extensive and richer additions to what ore is already in sight. Five years' steady run of the mill will hardly make a perceptible decrease in the huge supply. The facility and very light cost with which this surface ore is mined and milled, is unequaled by any other mine on the entire Comstock ledge. The affairs of the company are in a very healthy and prosperous state, and I even hear a dividend hinted at, as to be declared before long—a decided novelty for the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>Small Pox.</p><p>This loathsome and terrible disease seems to have nearly or quite died out, owing doubtless to the delightful weather we are at present in the enjoyment of. During the prevalence of the recent stormy, cold, disagreeable weather, there were several cases of it, including even your correspondent; but all are recovered, and I have not heard of a fresh case for nearly a week. Good riddance to the foul nuisance. It has been with us just about a year.</p><p>Fatal Mining Accident.</p><p>Last Saturday afternoon Daniel Miller, a young man working in the Savage mine, accidentally fell about seventy feet down a winze to the track floor of the 300-foot level. He was picked up insensible by some of his fellow miners and brought out. His left arm was broken above the elbow, his head was cut, and from his spitting of blood, he was doubtless injured internally. The worst injury, however, was to his back; the spine was broken a short distance above the small of the back, resulting in complete paralysis of the lower limbs, which still continues. The unfortunate young man cannot recover, but yet may live for several weeks or months. He is free from pain, has made his will—he leaving some property—and is now ready and willing to die. He is only twenty-three years of age, and a native of Lower Canada.</p><p>Large Assay.</p><p>Only a day or two ago Gen. John B. Winters showed me the result of an assay made by the assayer of the Yellow Jacket works. It was a piece of rock from a newly discovered ledge some forty miles east of White Pine, and showed fine gold disseminated all through the specimen. The result of the assay was a showing of over $57,000 per ton. The ledge is about sixty feet wide, but is not all quite so rich as that. I saw an assay from the Empire ledge, over in Excelsior, two or three months ago, which went over $90,000 to the ton. Some of these gold ledges assay stunningly sometimes. They are also promising; very promising considerable more than they perform.</p><p>Dream Process.</p><p>Speaking of Excelsior reminds me of the wonderful process for desulphurizing the rebellious ores of that district which was dreamed out by a Mrs. Burns about a year and a half ago. Mrs. B. and her husband had been living at Meadow Lake for some time, and like everybody else they were getting pretty badly discouraged. The ores were rich enough, there was no sort of doubt about that, but they were so variously and intimately combined with sulphur in some form or other, that all the ordinary and extraordinary processes adopted totally failed to separate the precious metal to any paying extent. They were talking of leaving, as many had already done, when one night Mrs. Burns dreamed that her brother, an old miner some time deceased, appeared to her and told her not to be at all discouraged; that fortune lay within her grasp, that the chemical materials for the cheap, easy and complete desulphurizing of the rebellious ones of the district she had always had by her in the house. In short he told her to use a little -----, and a little -----, in conjunction with a little -----, and the thing was done. She told her husband about it next day, and they tried it, and, sure enough, there was no nonsense about it; the desulphurization was actually accomplished, just as easy as rolling off a log. Next thing was to get a patent for the process. Burns was a poor man, and he found many obstacles in his way, but at length he has succeeded in getting his patent papers, and now is trying to bring the process into practical use. He claims that by the new process the most rebellious sulphuret ores can be desulphurized for $8 per ton and even less. Only a few days ago I saw fine samples of about a pound each from five of the most prominent mines of Excelsior, which had been subjected to this process. They were each of the rich rebellious sulphuret character which could not be made to pay at all by the ordinary processes, but after treatment their character was materially changed. They looked as though they had been burnt thoroughly, being dark-colored, soft and crumbly, and showing many particles of free gold. Rubbed to a powder and washed in a saucer, a good prospect in free gold was obtained every time. I understand that the Mohawk & Montreal Company in Excelsior are going to give this wonderful process a trial by a working test of a considerable quantity of their rich sulphuret rock. Oftentimes a new process works well enough on a small scale and yet totally fails to come up to practical requirements on a large scale. If the dream process, however, holds out as well as it promises, it is one of the ""big things"" of the age.</p><p>Theatrical</p><p>John E. Owens, the eminent comedian, supported by a very excellent stock company, will appear at Piper's Opera House for the first time to-night. ""Everybody's Friend"" and ""Solon Shingle"" are the plays to be given. How Owens will take here, of course, remains to be seen.</p><p>Hartz concluded his six night's engagement last Sunday evening. He did very well, but did not succeed so well as Heller did when he was here, or could do again. Heller has got more style and variety. The  ""Great Champion Circus and Zoological Institute,"" composed of James Cooke, the really excellent jester, Jack Lee, a lady rider, several good tumblers, a monkey, two camels and a buffalo, have drawn immense houses, or rather tents full, the last two nights, at Virginia, and they will have another densely crowded tent to-night, at lower Gold Hill. The horse opera always wins here. Let two horses and a wheelbarrow, accompanied by a base drum and a cornet, come over here performing in a tent, and call itself a circus, and it is sure of big houses for a week. The Piutes, Chinese, miners, merchants, in fact, everybody, high or low toned, will go to the circus.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH12.jpg,sf-herald
SFH13,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL, June 6, 1869.</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>The grading for the railroad between Virginia and Carson is one-half completed, and in less than two months from now will be entirely finished, tunnels and all. Unless there is some unexpected delay in procuring the requisite supply of iron the track will be laid and the car running by October. The work thus far has been prosecuted with most effectual energy and ability, very creditable to all concerned. It certainly is a very crooked road, but this could not well be avoided, in view of the great rise to be overcome between the two points. The greatest fault I have to find with the location of it consists in the fact that in crossing Gold Canyon, on Main street, at the upper end of this town, the rails are to be laid on a level with the street, instead of being carried across over the street on a proper trestle bridge, high enough to allow teams of all descriptions to pass beneath it, out of all danger of collision. This might and ought to have been done by all means, and the company will realize the importance of the idea this next winter. There is probably no street in the world which is subjected to harder wear or severer usage than this. The grade being steep, the numerous heavy quartz teams all have to pass down it with locked wheels, especially in winter, when it is slippery. This has the effect to grind and tear the street terribly, particularly when rough locks have to be used. The railroad grade across it will make a very awkward sort of a pitch or offset in it, even if the teams do not tear out the rails in passing over them. It will keep one man there steadily, taking care of the track and keeping it clear of mud and other obstructions. A more eligible place for collisions, too, could hardly be contrived, for even after this railroad is completed, and has to a certain degree done away with quartz teaming, there will still be plenty of teams hauling quartz to the mills in Gold Canon, as well as trains of huge wagons coming in from California loaded with merchandise, same as they do now. Those long teams of twelve and fourteen mules, with two or three wagons attached, do not travel fast, especially up a steep hill, and being hidden from sight at that crossing by the houses on each side of the street, the chances are that the locomotive would come upon them unawares, especially as it approaches in a short curve from either way, and on the north side from a tunnel. An ox team would stand no show at all. In case of a collision the engineer would be blameless, for he could not possibly see a team crossing in time to avoid it, and the railroad proprietors would simply have to foot the bills. Well, time will show how things will operate at that point. We shall see.</p><p>Railroad Accident</p><p>About six o'clock last evening, on the aforesaid railroad, at American Flat, by the premature explosion of a heavy blast, one workman was blown forty feet into the air, and, falling among some rock, was almost instantly killed. He was literally torn to pieces, his bowels strewn upon the ground, and most of his bones broken. Another man working with him, was terribly cut and bruised, but not seriously injured.</p><p>Died.</p><p>David Miller, the young man of whom I made mention in my last, as being fatally injured in falling seventy feet down a winze in the Savage mine, last Saturday, died yesterday morning, having lived just a week with his back broken. The lower part of his body continued perfectly paralyzed from the first, never recovering the least degree of sensation. He was buried this afternoon by the Canadian Relief Society, of which he was a member.</p><p>Theatrical</p><p>John E. Owens takes well with our theatre goers of Virginia and Gold Hill, and Piper's Opera House is filled nightly to witness his serio-comic and decidedly popular delineations. I think he can twist his physiognomy into more whimsical shapes than anybody else on the coast. He is well supported by an excellent dramatic company. James Stark is still at the International, Virginia, slowly recovering from his terrible stroke of paralysis. He is able to walk about a little, but cannot talk much. The Champion Circus performs at Empire to-night, at Silver City to-morrow night, and Thursday evening at Gold Hill, for the benefit of Liberty Engine Company, No. 1.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket.</p><p>This famous mine is being worked at present with far greater energy and double the force of hands than before the fire—some 400 miners being employed. The pay roll for the last month amounted to $20,000, and this month it will be considerably larger. One reason of this extraordinary number of men is that the drift connections formerly existing between that mine and the Kentuck, furnishing a free circulation of air, being now closed on account of the fire, the air is very hot and impure; consequently eight hour shifts are adopted. The fire still burns in the Kentuck and Crown Point, but is blockaded on all sides. A large number of men, recently employed on the Pacific Railroad, are now working in the Yellow Jacket, and they, as well as the old hands in the mine, as might be expected, have a strong impression of the dangers attendant upon working in those subterranean regions, since the recent terrible calamity. All are ready to rush out at the slightest alarm.</p><p>A Powerful Scare.</p><p>Considerable trepidation was created among some of the miners yesterday, by a back current of air driving some gaseous smoke through from the Kentuck into the Yellow Jacket, and some of the men came to the surface, but the gas subsiding, all soon were at work as before. In order to counteract the effects of the bad air, the miners have bottles of hartshorn and bay rum with them down in the mine, to take a smell at occasionally. About ten o'clock this forenoon, there was a powerful alarm created at the800-foot level, and a general rush was made for the cages; one or two men being said to have been already overpowered by the dreaded gas and left for dead in the drift. Up they come to the surface, and directly fresh hands ventured down to rescue the victims, if possible. They were found alive and kicking, and able to tell their own story, which was thusly: One of them, feeling like taking a sniff of something reviving, picked up his hartshorn bottle, which in the extreme hot atmosphere had become considerably heated, and on giving it a bit of a shake the thing bursted, sending forth such a powerful smell that it knocked him down. A companion near by, seeing him fall, thought of the fatal gas, and instead of stopping to assist him, started like a race horse for the cage in the shaft. He did not run a dozen yards, however, before he hit his head against a low cap timber and knocked himself over backward. He was the only one hurt. When all was explained work went on as before.</p><p>Sierra Nevada Mine.</p><p>In my last I spoke of the excellent prospects and bullion products of this valuable mine; also, of it being rumored that a dividend would soon be declared. This idea was based upon the great amount of rich ore developed in the upper workings of the mine, the great yield of gold bullion during the past month—more than ever before—and the still better class of ore being milled for the present month. Last month the yield was over $23,000, upwards of $13,000. This month the yield will doubtless run up to over $30,000. Day before yesterday a dividend of $2.50 per share was declared payable on the 10th instant. This is quite a novelty in its way, being the first dividend ever declared on that mine, which for the last eight or nine years has been steadily worked and assessments regularly levied upon it. This change in finances is due entirely to the present Board of Trustees, and T. F. Smith, the Superintendent, who brought his mining knowledge pretty effectually to bear in the case and soon nosed out the present developed rich and extensive deposit of ore. When Smith took charge of the mine and mill there was an assessment of $12.50 per share already levied, but he soon got to producing so much bullion that it was deemed expedient to rescind that assessment, greatly to the joy of the anxious stockholders. There has been no assessment thought of since, but such an accumulation of funds in the treasury, that not only this little dividend can be easily spared, but it will be followed up monthly hereafter, and most probably increased. Day before yesterday a decidedly novel style of a blast was let off at the mine. An inch and a half hole was drilled to the depth of fifteen feet in a bank of soft ore, and a couple of cartridges of giant powder being shoved down to the bottom, it was exploded. It did not crack the earth, but merely made a good sized cavity in the immediate vicinity. Into this was then poured two kegs of common blasting powder, which, on being exploded, lifted the bank, throwing out tons upon tons of very rich ore, in much of which plenty of free gold was visible. It is better ore than yet found in the mine, and the mill is now hard at work crushing it at the rate of forty-five tons per day.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH13.jpg,sf-herald
SFH14,"<p>LETTER FROM GOLD HILL.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT TO THE HERALD.]</p><p>GOLD HILL, Nev., June 13, 1869.</p><p>Weather.</p><p>Unlike the White Piners, we have no particular occasion to grumble at our weather; it does very well, and now that the small-pox has about disappeared, there is very little sickness either in Gold Hill or Virginia. Old Keyes, the Virginia undertaker, is beginning to look a little blue over it, as even fatal mining accidents are scarce now. When the small-pox was doing its worst last year, he looked jolly, and had lots to do; in fact he was of the opinion that if he could have another good season like that, he would be out of debt and all right financially.</p><p>Getting Fast.</p><p>Until that great railroad got across the Sierra Nevada the people of this section were contented with ordinary rates of travelling, but now they are not. The cars demoralized and revolutionized everybody's ideas in that respect, and ever since nothing less than pony expresses, velocipedes, and more railroad will do. The pony racing by the rival express companies from Reno to Virginia each evening on the arrival of the cars, was a very lively and attractive feature. Crowds of people lined the sidewalks to see the ponies come in, and pretty soon some sportive and excitable gents got to waiting just outside of town, on good horses, and would come trooping in like flying dragoons along with the ponies. The whole fun, however, was spoiled one evening by the city police arresting all hands, pony riders and all, for fast riding. The Pacific Union Express pony still comes in every evening with letters, but Wells, Fargo & Co. have taken off their pony and substituted a fast stage instead, which runs on a little less than pony time, bring in the mails, express and a few fast passengers, about an hour ahead of their regular coaches.</p><p>The velocipede mania came with the small-pox and is likely to leave with it, as it has very materially subsided. Some persistent chap is occasionally seen on the streets of Virginia, of an evening, industriously working his two-wheeled treadmill, sweating in his shirt sleeves as he cranks along on his wobbling way. There don't seem to be any particular use for velocipedes here, unless they would come in fashion for funerals. They would be cheap for that, much cheaper than hiring livery horses to ride out to the graveyard and back on, same as at present. Livery horses, too, always run away or get to racing on the road home, especially if they happen to stop at a brewery by the way. Gold Hill is a poor velocipede ranch, there being no level ground, therefore we can't indulge extensively.</p><p>We are getting along splendidly with that new railroad to Carson, and as I said in my last, it will be completed much sooner than at first anticipated. Money can do almost anything. ""Money makes the mare go."" I think velocipedes and mares differ some in that respect, however. Balloons are not in vogue here just yet.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>Nothing of a very sensational nature has transpired since my last writing, in the history and condition of the mines along the Comstock, or anywhere in this section. Generally speaking, they are looking healthy and promise well.</p><p>The Overman mine still continues to yield considerable bullion, although no extraordinarily rich bodies of high grade ore are encountered at the present time</p><p>The Belcher, and the Segregated Belcher, are not yielding much ore of either high or low grade. Both are known to contain good bodies of ore, but for reasons best known to the powers controlling them, prospecting for more ore is what is principally being done at present,</p><p>The Crown Point yields no ore, but the drifts east, at the 1,000 and 1,100-foot levels, are being driven towards the ledge as energetically as possible, and in the full confidence that when the ledge is reached, rich and extensive bodies of ore will be developed. Above those levels there is plenty of pay ore in the mine, but that is where the fire is still burning, therefore, all the levels are carefully and tightly closed, in order to confine the obstinately smouldering element where it is, and keep it from doing harm outside of its limits.</p><p>The Kentuck yields ore enough from the upper levels to keep the Sunderland mill running. The lower levels are blocked up like the Crown Point, and for the same reasons.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket is being most vigorously worked, but rather at a disadvantage, owing to lack of the requisite free circulation of air, the consequent oppressive heat compelling the resort to eight-hour shifts. The ore is extracted at a high expense, therefore stockholders need not look for any more dividends for a while (unless it be an ""Irish"" one.</p><p>The small mines to the northward of it, in Gold Hill proper, are all yielding more or less good ore from their upper levels, but at the lower levels they have nothing developed.</p><p>The Imperial yields about fifty tons of ore per day from its upper levels. The receipts for May amounted to $43,000. Annual meeting of stockholders, June 29th. No ore whatever developed at the two lowest levels. The new shaft is 1,140 feet deep, and the bottom is in barren vein matter. Sinking deeper is being actively prosecuted, with strong hope of soon passing through the barren belt into good pay ore. They are running a drift south now, at the 1,080-foot level from the shaft, through the Empire, Eclipse, and other small claims, to the old ""Holmes ground,"" owned by the Imperial Company, and where they will doubtless intersect the rich and extensive body of ore dipping towards it for the Yellow Jacket. The drift has already penetrated over 100 feet, and two months more will tell the story. But little water is found at the bottom of the shaft, less than above, and decreasing as depth is attained.</p><p>The Bullion Company are drifting east at their 1,400-foot level, and expect soon to strike good quartz. At that depth it is found to be very dry, with no water whatever. A plentiful supply of fresh air is furnished by the blower, from the surface.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields about 175 tons of ore per day, averaging nearly $50 per ton, according to assay. The drift north, at the 1,100-foot level develops no new and rich bodies of ore, and lacks only about twenty feet of connecting with the Hale & Norcross. When this connection is made it will give a new and valuable draft of air to both mines.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross mine keeps up its lick pretty well, yielding about 150 tons per day—principally from the two lowest levels. There the pay streak is so wide that it is difficult to timber sufficiently strong to prevent caving as it is worked out. Another level, 100 feet beneath the present level, will soon be opened.</p><p>The Savage is looking exceedingly well throughout, although the receipts for May amounted to $155,100, being $18,000 less than the yield for April. This, however, was, of course, owing entirely to the grade of ore worked.</p><p>The Gould & Curry shaft, over 1,200 feet deep, has got through the vein into the west country rock. A drift east is commenced near that point, to go through to the east wall of the ledge. They ought to find some good ore in this drift if they are ever going to.</p><p>The Virginia Consolidated Company are actively sinking their new shaft between E and F streets, Virginia, but it will be many months before it will be deep enough to develop anything in the bullion-producing line at that point.</p><p>At the new shaft of the Ophir, the drift west for the ledge is now over 350 feet. The face is still in hard blasting rock, with no particularly encouraging signs developing.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada mine looks better and better every day, the continual developments of rich ore in the surface workings being far in excess of what is daily required. They are milling about forty-five tons per day now—all of it rich in free gold. A clean up will be made in a day or two, and present indications confirm me in my former prediction that the yield for the present month will be the best ever obtained from that mine.</p><p>Incipient Midshipman.</p><p>In accordance with the advisement of Congressman Fitch, to the effect that we could send a boy from this State to be educated and trained to be a midshipman, at the United States Naval Academy, a committee of four, consisting of A. N. Fisher, C. J. Hillyer, J. C. Lewis and Wm. Haydon, have been holding an examination for the last three days in order to make the proper selection. There were ten applicants from various parts of the State, and the result was that the committee became completely nonplussed with the wonderful smartness of the boys, and simply succeeded in reducing the number down to three; and unable to decide which possesses the true qualifications for the position, they refer these three to Congressman Fitch for final decision. The following are their names, ages, etc.: Albert A. Michelson, aged sixteen years six months; residence Virginia City; educated at Boys High School, San Francisco; James Willson Blakely, fourteen years eleven months; Treasure City; student Austin Academy, Nevada; William Gifford Cutler; fourteen years, six months; Dayton, Nevada; educated at Oakland College School, California.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>Fanny Morgan Phelps succeeded John E. Owens as the star attraction at Piper's Opera House, Virginia, commencing last Thursday evening. She has not succeeded very well, playing to indifferent houses and at a loss to both herself and management. Her engagement closes with a benefit next Wednesday evening, when she will have a good house, probably. James Stark and wife are still at the International, Virginia. Stark can walk about the house a little, but he has not by any means recovered from his recent severe paralytic stroke. He was paralyzed in both body and mind, and is a mere wreck, both physically and mentally. I do not believe he will ever appear as an actor on the dramatic stage again. His numerous friends in this section propose giving him a benefit at Piper's Opera House, next Thursday night. He will most undoubtedly have a very full house and a substantial benefit. After that the Opera House will close for the season, and the company so long playing there will be turned adrift on the great dramatic sea. It would be a good time for Heller, the Martinettis, or even a first-class melodeon company to come over here. No scrub attractions, however, will do at all. The best, and none other, can draw paying houses.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH14.jpg,sf-herald
SFH15,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., June 20, 1869.</p><p>Local Items.</p><p>My letters heretofore have been principally dated from Gold Hill, but the two towns being so near together as to be almost one, it makes no difference particularly which place I write from; therefore, being in Virginia, I write you this letter from that lop-sided city, and will give you the principal local items of interest transpiring in both towns.</p><p>Suicidal Jerker.</p><p>Lizzie Williams, one of the fair ones, who is in the habit of loving not wisely but too well, tried to massacre herself with a bottle of chloroform last evening, at her room on south C street. Her man, a tall, good-looking artist, saw fit to give her a jealous thrashing night before last, and the lacerations to both body and mind were too much for the sensitive Lizzie; so, after brooding over her smarting wrongs for twenty-four hours, she concluded to shuffle off this mortal coil, and in order to soothe and ease it off agreeably she went to Dan Virgil Gates' drug-store and invested in a two-ounce vial of chloroform. Then she went home to her room, and calling her land-lady, she spoke her last dying piece to her, and then tipped down the chloroform, or at least the greater part of it. It went down worse and tasted worse than third-class rot-gut whiskey, and great was the commotion created. A doctor was at once summoned, and after a severe turn at vomiting, etc., she lay panting and partly exhausted on her bed. She is better to-day, and an iced cocktail or so soothes the soreness of her throat. This is not Lizzie's first sensation in the suicide line. She tried to shoot herself a year or so ago, with a horse-pistol, but missed the mark and slaughtered a big trunk which stood near by. Then she lay down and spoke a lot of very impressive dying words to a couple of weeping friends, but suddenly thinking of her recent lover (not the present one), she sprang up, loaded a Derringer to the muzzle with grape and canister, and away she went down street to hunt him up and blow him into smithereens. He heard about her raid, and judiciously kept out of her way. Whether she will succeed in rubbing herself off the great slate of human existence next time is a matter for future items, perhaps.</p><p>Found Dead.</p><p>In all instances the above are sad sounding, sad looking words. They signify relief, however, in some shape, and in that light were never more significant than in the case of the poor, miserable prostitute, well known in this city as Liz Hayes, who was found dead about ten o'clock A. M. to-day. She has been keeping a little, low crib on South C street, adjoining where the above-mentioned suicidal attempt took place, for the last year or two, and has been a resident of Virginia for six or seven years. Latterly she had sunk to the very lowest depths of degradation, and the effects of her career of vice, dissipation and disease was plainly apparent. During the last two weeks she has had a physician doctoring her for congestion of the brain, and for three or four days she has scarcely been able to drag her failing limbs about the house. Another woman of her class, Maria King, has been stopping wither, and says that last night, about two o'clock, as she was sleeping on a sofa in the bar-room, Liz came in from her bedroom and took a drink at the bar. That was the last that she observed of her, as she went to sleep again. A man sleeping next door says he heard the poor thing about six o'clock this morning, breathing with a rattling noise in her throat, as though suffocating, but thought nothing unusual of it, as he knew she was sick. About ten o'clock Maria King awoke and saw her lying on the floor of the bar-room, flat on her breast, with her face turned to the left, cold and dead. She at once summoned, on examination said she evidently had been dead three or four hours. A Coroner's inquest was held this afternoon. She leaves only about property enough to pay her burial expenses. I should judge her to be about thirty-five years of age. She leaves a son, twelve years old, who resides in San Francisco. Thus ends a very ill-spent life, but let us hope that the account closes forever with her death.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>Nothing worthy of special note has occurred in the way of mining developments since my last writing, in either the mines of Gold Hill or this part of the Comstock. In consequence of the difficulty of securing proper ventilation, the Yellow Jacket mine is working less than 100 men, on eight-hour shifts. Human nature, even the best and rugged constitutions, cannot stand everything. The principal working is now in and about the north mine, with a view of starting up the old works, sink the north shaft deeper, and connect it with the drifts being run from the south shaft at the 800 and 900-foot levels. When this is done, the ventilation will be good, besides opening up a vast amount of good ore. The works will start up about the first of next month. The Crown Point Company are still drifting at their two lower levels, and at the 1,000-foot they are approaching near the ledge. A great increase of water is encountered, and the old hands are discharged and their places supplied by total strangers. The Kentuck is getting along slow, and a less quantity of ore is coming out. The fire is still considered to be burning in that and the Crown Point but remains hemmed in by the closing of the drifts. The Sierra Nevada Company made their first clean up for the month on the 15th instant; it yielded over $10,000. The next clean up, on the last of the month, will be far better, as much richer ore is developed and being milled.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The engagement of Fanny Morgan Phelps, at Piper's Opera House, closed last Wednesday evening. It was not a lucrative engagement either to herself or the management. Stark is still sick at the International. A grand complimentary benefit was given him at the Opera House, last evening, and entertainment being vocal music by the Choral Society, and recitations, etc., by volunteers. The net proceeds were over $1,000. Wilson's Great World Circus opens here Tuesday evening for three evenings. It will be well patronized. The circus always is.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH15.jpg,sf-herald
SFH16,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., June 27, 1869.</p><p>The Christian Sabbath.</p><p>Cheerily peals forth the sweet church bells, and a portion of our cosmopolitan population are wending their way toward the several houses of worship. The ladies are all dressed to their prettiest extent, and although not tricked out in Grecian bend and similar styles of ridiculous fancy so prevalent in more fashionable communities, yet they all look neat and attractive. We have got better looking ladies here, on the average, than you have in San Francisco. The little girls, too, with slim legs and clean white stockings, short frocks and skirts that stick out starchily all around, and neat little hats, with gay ribbons, go switching pertly along together, each with a juvenile parasol held rigidly at a particular angle, regardless of which way the sun shines. To be fixed up this way once a week constitute some of the most important and pleasurable eras of their dear little lives. The men, too, have got their best clothes on, but they don't all get to church. Those who go with their wives generally make the trip, but bachelors and those who go it on their own responsibility are less reliable. Man of them really do start for the church, but can't get past the brewery, especially on a hot day like this, when the most moderate and least excitable thermometer in town indicates 85 degrees in the shade. Men will draw unfavorable contrasts between a dry sermon in a hot, uncomfortable church, when politeness and a sense of religious duty obliges them to stay, whether they like it or not, and a seat at ease, with genial companions, around a gallon of cool lager. The breweries win the day. A very lively game is also in progress at an Irish hand-ball alley, not a pistol shot from where I am writing, and the loud shouts and laughter of the excited players commingling with the church bells pealing. Away down in the bowels of the earth, beneath the very streets and house of Gold Hill and Virginia, hundreds of men are busily toiling by the dim light of candles, amid the drifts and subterranean chambers of the silver mines, toiling for the support of those very churches and their precious congregations. The sound of their picks do not mingle with the church bells ringing; neither do thoughts of them and prayers for their safety enter very often or too largely into the head of the well-fed parson, as with stereotyped devoutness and sanctified attitude he supplicates the Thorne of Grace from his fine pulpit. Should, ball player; sing away, ye holly brewery revelers; blow, steam whistles; rattle, buggy wheels; tune up your fiddles, ye hurdy house musicians, for your evening's work. All these are the evidences and accompaniments of civilization and Christianity. Peal on. Sweet church bells, peal on.</p><p>Theatricals, Etc.</p><p>Kennedy, the Scottish vocalist, appeared at Piper's Opera House last evening and the evening before. His entertainments, consisting of song and story, tale and ballad, principally of a Scottish nature, are very good indeed, and attract excellent audiences. He closes to-morrow evening. Wilson's Great World Circus performs at Gold Hill this evening and at Washoe City to-morrow evening. It succeeds well wherever it goes. It will be in this city again on the 3d, 4th and 5th of July. Anna Dickinson lectures at the Presbyterian church to-morrow evening before a very large and fashionable audience. Subject: ""Nothing Unreasonable."" Mrs. Augusta Mina St. Clair lectured, evening before last, at Gold Hill, on the interesting subject of ""Whom Shall I Marry?"" and last evening her subject was, ""My Southern Tour."" She did not have large audiences. She is advertised to lecture in this city to-night on the subject of ""Woman as Maiden, Wife, Mother."" Mrs. E. F. Keach, the well known actress, takes a grand complimentary benefit at Piper's Opera House next Thursday evening. From present indications she will have a crowded house. Anna Dickinson has gone fishing. She and a whole crowd of other pleasure seekers from here and Gold Hill went over to Lake Tahoe yesterday. She will be back in time to lecture to-morrow evening, most likely.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>Matters relative to the Crown Point, Kentuck, and Yellow Jacket mines, remain about the same as when I last wrote, as far as new developments of ore are concerned. The drift east at the 1,000-foot level of the Crown Point, has penetrated the west ledge, but nothing satisfactory is developed. They expect to strike it rich in the east ledge when they get to it. All the old hands are discharged, and none but strangers are working in that level, so as to keep all knowledge of operations and developments, at this important point, as far as possible from outsiders. This is not easily done, however. The drift below at the 1,100-foot level is much impeded in progress by the great amount of water encountered, keeping the pump and a 260-gallon cage tank constantly going. Yesterday afternoon, while raising this tank full of water, the crank of one of the hoisting engines broke short off, causing the immediate smashing out of both cylinder heads. Fortunately no one was hurt or scalded. The tank was eased back to the bottom of the shaft without injury.</p><p>The Kentuck yields about fifty tons of ore per day, supplying the Sunderland and Pioneer mills. Forty men are employed in the mine at the upper levels. This is only about half as many men as used to work in that mine before the fire, which is still burning.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket, which, three or four weeks ago employed 400 miners, now employs only about 60. The air was so hot and foul in the mine, owing to lack of ventilation, that human fresh and blood could not stand it, even on eight hour shifts. Men were continually fainting and being brought out. One of the last laid three hours, insensible, before he could be revived. Jim O'Donnell, the foreman of the mine, was reinstated day before yesterday morning, and Kellogg, who for the last seven months has held that position, is discharged. O'Donnell was foreman for seven years, until Kellogg was put in his place. He is confining his operations to the north mine exclusively, and in three or four days will secure better ventilation by means of a winze connecting the 800 and 900 foot levels. Another winze will also within three weeks connect these levels with the 700 level and bottom of the north shaft, thus affording full and free ventilation throughout the north mine. The old hoisting works over that shaft are being thoroughly overhauled and renovated, and in about thirty days will be running. Before that time the bullion products of the Yellow Jacket will be small; indeed, good, prosperous working may not be looked for under two months. By that time it is to be hoped that the south mine may become available again.</p><p>The Imperial-Empire shaft looks extremely discouraging at the bottom. It is 1,160 feet deep, and now develop nothing but hard, black porphyry, with no quartz worth speaking of. The only hope appears to be in the expected good body of ore to be developed in the old Holmes ground, by means of the south drift, which has penetrated 140 feet from the shaft. It will reach its destination in six or seven weeks.</p><p>A few days ago an important drift connection was made between the 1,100 foot level of the Chollar-Potosi and the Hale & Norcross 1,030-footlevel. This gives a very powerful draft of fresh air through both mines, a most inestimable blessing to all miners. The current is from south to north, the surface of the Hale & Norcross shaft being higher than that of the Chollar-Potosi. Both mines are in healthy condition and yielding well. The same may be said of the Savage. It is looking exceedingly well throughout.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada Company will make their second clean-up for the month on the 30th. The yield for last month was the best ever known in the history of the mine, but that for the present month will be better still. The figures will not be far from $25,000. Another dividend will be declared in a few days. As the entire expenses of the company, including mining, milling, salaries, and everything else, are less than $8,000 per month, it is easily seen that dividends are a natural consequence. The mine and mill, and the general affairs of the company, are exceedingly well managed.</p><p>The Gould & Curry yields about fifty tons per day from the old upper workings. The deeper sinking of the Bonner shaft is discontinued, as it has gone through the ledge entirely, and into the west wall. The seventh station is being opened for a drift east, through the ledge, to see what may be found in that direction. The prospect looks dubious.</p><p>The Ophir west drift at the 700-foot level has penetrated 390 feet from the new shaft, and has at least 100 feet further to run in order to reach the ledge. It will be in rather an unfavorable part of the mine, therefore rich developments need not be too strongly counted on.</p><p>The Virginia Consolidated includes a combination of those unproductive claims on the Comstock lying between the Ophir and the Gould and Curry. The new company commenced operations a few weeks ago by breaking ground for a new shaft on a large lot they had secured between D and E streets, on the south side of Sutton avenue. This shaft is now excavated and timbered to the depth of fifty feet. It consists of two working compartments, each four and a half by five feet in the clear. It is timbered very substantially, the timbers being fourteen inches square, placed in setts four feet apart, and lagged between with three-inch plank. Ross & Co., the contractors for the first 500 feet, are doing their work in a very thorough, energetic, and workmanlike manner. This shaft is a very important one, as developing a heretofore unproductive portion of the Comstock, at a great depth. It is to be most earnestly hoped that this company may ""strike it rich.""</p><p>Preparing.</p><p>The various Fire Engine Companies in Virginia and Gold Hill are getting ready for the general firemans' tournament, which takes place in this city on the 5th of next month. Some of the machines are out pretty much every evening trying their squirting powers. One or two are out this afternoon. Which will take the champion badge remains to be seen, although many shrewd predictions are made, and every company is confident. Extensions and all sorts of contrivances are being adopted to increase the power and playing distance of each machine. There will be great and exciting fun on the grand day of trial, and much coin will change hands on the result.</p><p>Small-Pox.</p><p>This loathsome disease has entirely died out, as far as Gold Hill is concerned, and nearly so in this city. The only instance I know of its existence at the present time, is a very severe one. It is in the family of Mr. Bassett in Six-Mile Canon. The eldest son got it somewhere in this city and took it home. There are seven or eight children in the family, and they are all sick with the disease. Mr. Bassett is out at White Pine.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH16.jpg,sf-herald
SFH17,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., July 4, 1869.</p><p>The Glorious Fourth.</p><p>The most effervescent portion of our population commenced celebrating last evening, and pretty much all night a popping of crackers and banging of firearms was kept up, variegated with an occasional deep-toned roar from old ""General Grant,"" mounted on the ramparts of Fort Homestead, Gold Hill. It being Saturday night, many could get drunk just as well as not, and so they did. Nobody had to be arrested, however, and the police were lenient. The general hilarity continues to-day, in a subdued degree, out of respect for the Sabbath. From the summit of Mount Davidson proudly floats the Star Spangled Banner, and that same beautiful emblem also waves over the flagstaffs on the mining works, mills, public buildings, etc., throughout Virginia and Gold Hill. The formal celebration of the day will take place to-morrow, and, strange as it may appear, it will be done by citizens of foreign birth. The native born folks tried to get up a regular celebration, but the wrong individuals started it—anyhow, it was a fizzle. Only a few days ago the Miners' Unions of Virginia and Gold Hill, mostly composed of naturalized foreigners, concluded to take the matter in hand and put the celebration through. Accordingly, the procession is to be composed of the Miners' Unions, the Emmet and Sweeney Guards (both Irish companies), of Virginia and Gold Hill, the Canadian Relief Society, and such citizens as may see fit to join in. They will march to Gold Hill and back, and then to Piper's Opera House, where appropriate exercises will take place. The great fun of the day, however, will be the firemen's tournament in the afternoon. It will take place on C street, and is free to all organized fire companies in the State desiring to contend. The first prize is a large silver bullion trumpet, to be given to any eight men of any engine, hose, or hook and ladder company who make the best time with a hose carriage or jumper, carrying 500 feet of hose, to run from Young America Engine House to Knickerbocker Engine House, a distance of 1,452 feet. The second and most important prize will be a silver bullion plate, appropriately inscribed, which will be given as a champion badge, to be affixed to the box of the engine throwing a stream the greatest distance through and from 100 feet of hose. Six engines are entered for this trial, including Liberty Engine, No. 1, of Gold Hill (old Howard, No. 3, formerly of San Francisco), and it will be something strange if there is not a particularly extra amount of fun on that occasion. Each machine will be given eighteen minutes space of time to make the trial, and each will suit themselves in the matter of nozzles.</p><p>Supposed Case of Poisoning.</p><p>John Baldwin, a prominent and highly esteemed citizen, and a member of the firm of Cooper & Baldwin, keeping the Clipper Gap Hay and Wagon Yard, on North C street, near Sutton avenue, died last Thursday morning at his residence, in a very sudden and mysterious manner, and under circumstances which induced the belief that he was poisoned. He was in his usual health and good spirits the day and evening before, and was about the city as late as two o'clock in the morning, when he went home to bed. About an hour and a half afterward he sent for help, saying that he was very sick. Dr. Kibbe, the nearest physician, came immediately, and Baldwin told him to get a stomach pump and pump him out, for he was poisoned, and knew it. Proper remedies were immediately given him, but he was attacked by a succession of violent spasms, and died in a very few minutes. A post mortem examination was instituted next day and the stomach removed. Some of the doctors tested its contents to-day for strychnine, but found none. The Coroner's inquest will be held next Tuesday. Mr. Baldwin was nearly forty-eight years of age, comfortably situated, and had no cause for committing suicide. While at White Pine, a few months ago, he got run over by a wagon across his breast, and has never enjoyed as good health since as before; he has also been occasionally subject to spasms, from over eating or other derangements of the stomach, at which times he would insist that he was poisoned. I think, therefore, the Coroner's jury will bring in a verdict to the effect that he died from natural causes.</p><p>More Poison.</p><p>In my letter before last you will recollect that I made mention of a romantic jerker who drank a big dose of chloroform to kill herself, just because her present regular lover gave her a thrashing, out of jealousy. The drug was got out of her directly, and the thrashing apparently did her no good, for she has since given him tangible reasons to be jealous of a miner down at Gold Hill; so despairingly jealous that he up and followed suit with a dose of ""cold pizen,"" last Wednesday evening. He, however, succeeded no better in dying than she did, and was all right again the next day with the exception of a foul stomach. It's her next play, but if they are going to follow this thing up, they ought to use bigger doses. I shouldn't like to be in love that desperate; it's mighty rough on the nerves.</p><p>Chance for Poison.</p><p>Out on the Divide, between here and Gold Hill, resides with her fond parents a romantic young damsel who has just arrived at that interesting age when all young ladies want to get married—bad. She has smiled on several young men, but finally and most sweetly on a young stock actor, whom I will call George. This gallant and brave preferred lover soon ran off all the rest of them, even in one case by talking duel, and ""blood, Iago, Blood."" The mother is willing, but the stern old father is not, and has forbidden George the house, or to even be caught in company with his daughter. Two or three evenings ago, through conspiracy with the mother, George got into the house and was evidently enjoying the sweet society of his dear one, when suddenly her furious pap burst in upon them. He drew a big dragoon revolver, and threatened to blast off the croppings of George's cranium. George was as quick as he was, however, and had the old chap covered with the muzzle of another six-shooter before he could bring his big dragoon up to range. Then there was much female screaming and some tall swearing, but it was a draw game, so the old man drew out. Since then he has shut his refractory daughter up in her room, under lock and key. But what's the use? He might as well try to keep water from running down hill, as to keep those two lovers from running into each other's arms. She will crawl out, or George will fish her out somehow.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>The aspect of things in the Yellow Jacket is much improved since my last writing. Jim O'Donnel, the old foreman of the mine, recently reinstated, set his wits to work to produce a draft of air in the south mine. This he has done by sheathing the compartment divisions, or partitions of the shaft up tight, and maintaining the division into the drifts of the mine. Thus, a draft of air sets down through one compartment through the drifts, and up again out of another compartment. By this means he was enabled to work 130 men last week in the lower levels, (the 800 and 900-foot,) where the good body of ore is and extract it at the rate of eighty tons per day. He says he will increase the number of men and take out 150 tons a day this next week. The repairs and renovating of the old north hoisting works will be completed by next Saturday, and they will be started up once more. When the water is all raised from the shaft, a winze connection will be made from the 700 to900-foot or lowest level, thus creating a plentiful supply of good air all through the mine, and a large amount of good ore will be got at.</p><p>The drift east at the 1,000-foot level of the Crown Point is in the ledge, but no rich developments are made as yet. An immense amount of water flows from this level. Nothing particularly new or interesting developed in the Kentuck; still getting ore enough out of the upper levels to supply the Sunderland and Pioneer mills. There is some talk of opening the closed drifts and connections of these and the Yellow Jacket mine this next week, as the fire is supposed to be burnt out. Kellogg, who for the last seven months has been foreman of the Yellow Jacket and Kentuck, is now foreman of the Hale & Norcross, taking the place of Wm. Skyrme, who has gone on a visit to his relatives and friends in Wales, England.</p><p>The Imperial-Empire shaft is to-day 1,167 feet deep, and sinking in hard black porphyry, with very little water to contend with. Some eighty feet of the shaft timbering, 600 feet from the surface, is being repaired at present. There is a crook in the shaft at that point, from the sagging of the earth. The drift south, at the 1,080-foot level, toward the Holmes ground, has penetrated 140 feet from the shaft, and a branch drift is commenced from it into the Empire ground. The late annual election resulted in Robert N. Graves, Superintendent of the Empire, being also chosen Superintendent of the Imperial. R. K. Colcord, Superintendent of the shaft, and Jeff. McClellan, underground foreman, are both superseded by Dave Monroe, foreman of the Empire—a commendable movement toward economy, which augurs well.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi is looking very well throughout, and yielding about 230 tons of ore per day. A considerable increase of water impedes operations at the 500-foot level drift into the Grass Valley body. A dividend of $20 per share was declared yesterday, payable next Wednesday.</p><p>The Virginia Consolidated new shaft is seventy-two feet deep, to-day, and the work of sinking still being energetically prosecuted.</p><p>The drift west, at the 700-foot level of the new Ophir shaft, is now in 411 feet, and the face of the drift is still in hard, dry gypsumized rock.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada Company had their second clean-up for May last Tuesday. The first clean-up on the 15th ult., was $10,000, but this will exceed it, the amalgam weighing five or six pounds more. The exact result will be known in two or three days. Meanwhile, the mill is pounding away on a fresh month's run, and the ore being worked is at least as good as that of last month. The quantity of this rich ore seems inexhaustible, and later developments, of which I will speak in my next, show it to be even more extensive than has heretofore been supposed. The Sierra Nevada is one of the paying mines of the Comstock, and another dividend is to be declared in a few days. A meeting of the Company is to be held next Tuesday to consider the proposition to divide the stock up into smaller shares.</p><p>Theatrical, etc.</p><p>Miss Geraldine Warden, formerly of the Lyster Opera Troupe, put in a first appearance last Friday evening, at Piper's Opera House, and to a very slim but enthusiastic and appreciative audience. She has not a very musical, but highly artistical voice, powerful, clear, of great compass, and she presents a pleasing stage appearance, but she comprised the entire entertainment. W. Vazie Simons, F. C. S. L. (Fellow of the Chemical Society, London), who is with her, came upon the stage between the songs, and read, not recited, in most miserable style, from some school book, a piece of poetry called ""The Little Vulgar Boy."" This was received in silence; but afterwards he came on again, and deliberately commenced a cook book lecture on ""The Economy of Food."" The audience listened patiently for five minutes, and then started in ""guying"" him, so that he had to quit before he was quarter through. What the devil does this F. C. S. L. take us for up here? Does he think we never read all about that! The idea of his ringing such dry hash into an operatic entertainment! Well, some folks have got a heap of cheek. He was a success, however, in one sense, for he didn't stay long enough to get a cabbage thrown at him. He wisely refrained last evening. Miss Warden will give her last entertainment to-morrow evening. She had a $50 house last night.</p><p>Dan Costello's ""Circus Menagerie and Abyssinian Caravan,"" on its way across the continent per railroad, will exhibit at Reno, July 12th, and in this city July 13th and 14th.

It looks like a fluttering sheet of flame, only a thousand times more magnificent, standing forth as it does in bold relief against the blue sky, strongly contrasted with the dark, rugged sage-brush covered sides of the big mountain. No wonder large crowds of people are gathered in the streets gazing on that glorious sight. God bless the flag of our country, and the Devil sleep with him who don't like it.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH17.jpg,sf-herald
SFH18,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>All Over.</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., July 11, 1869.</p><p>The grand celebration of the Fourth here by the Miners' Unions of Virginia and Gold Hill, and foreign born citizens generally, passed off admirably. The procession was a good long one, and with the Emmet and Sweeney Guards in the lead, and a good band of music, it presented a very neat and gratifying appearance. They marched to Gold Hill and back, and through the principal streets to Piper's Opera House, where the Declaration of Independence was read, and other appropriate exercises observed. The great feature of the day, however, was the firemen's tournament on C street, of which I gave you the programme in my last. The champion badge for the farthest throwing was won by Eagle Engine Company, No.3. The jumper race for a big silver trumpet was very warmly contested, but owing to some irregularity or misunderstanding, the prize was not awarded, and it was decided by the judges that the race should be run over again to-day. It did not take place, however, to-day, therefore the matter remains undecided.</p><p>Highway Robberies.</p><p>The ""road agents"" are at their old tricks again, hereabouts. Only last Thursday night, about eleven o'clock, a Mr. Moore, of Gold Hill, was stopped by a muffled brigand on the Divide, while on his way home from Virginia, and robbed of his gold watch, worth $250, and twenty-three dollars in coin. About nine o'clock last evening William Weir, a dealer in hams and bacon who arrived in town a few days since from the Sacramento River, was stopped by three men at the junction of the two roads just beyond the Overman mine, on American Flat, and relieved of $1,236 in cash, a breastpin, and whatever else he had about him worth taking. He was mounted, and at once rode to Virginia and informed the police. They at once started out, and a couple of hours afterwards arrested three men whom they thought looked suspicious. They resisted, and therefore got used rough. They were taken to the station-house, but were subsequently released, there being no tangible evidence against them. No other arrests have been made.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>Matters with the Yellow Jacket look livelier and more prosperous at present than at any time since the terrible calamity of three months ago, and if that infernal, long-continued fire was only out, things would go on most swimmingly. As I described in my last, the very fair artificial draft of air has been created throughout the 800 and 900-foot levels of the south mine, and last week an increased number of men were put to work, extracting ore at the rate of nearly 150 tons per day. The repairs and refitting of the old hoisting works over the north shaft, are about completed, and they were started up yesterday afternoon, for the first time in a little over a year. The reels are being turned off now, and to-morrow the hoisting of water from the shaft commences. There is about 300 feet of this water to raise which will be done in a very lively manner by means of huge tubs with valve bottoms. When this water is all out, a winze connection will be made from the 700-foot level, where the bottom of the shaft is through to the 900, giving a grand and perfect circulation of air through the entire mine. Large quantities of good ore will also be taken from this old north mine, which is far from worked out. As I stated in my last, the fire was supposed to have burnt out, therefore, it was thought best to reopen the closed drifts of the Crown Point and Yellow Jacket. Accordingly, last Wednesday, the barricade in the 700-foot level of the Yellow Jacket, about 100 feet north of the shaft, was removed thus opening direct communication with the burnt district. A heavy stream of foul gas immediately started out, continuing day after day. Friday afternoon the 700, 800 and 900-foot levels of the Crown Point were similarly reopened, and the effect was shortly perceivable in a large increase of gas through the Yellow Jacket, which soon was accompanied by smoke, and got so bad that Saturday morning the miners were driven out, in fact several were brought out asphyxiated and fainting from the effects of that terrible gas. As soon as possible the 700-foot level was closed again, and the men were enabled to return to work. The reopened levels of the Crown Point were also closed again before noon; the fact that fire and plenty of it, still exists in the east ledge above the 800-foot level, being satisfactorily demonstrated. How long that fire will continue to burn, the Lord only knows. Being hemmed in, and fresh air excluded as much as possible, it burns slowly like a charcoal pit. It has burned already over three months, and may for many months longer. It took nine or ten years to put all that timbering into the bowels of the earth which is on fire now; but it is to be hoped it may not take that length of time to burn out.</p><p>The drift east at the 1,000-foot level of the Crown Point mine, has passed through the ledge. Some very good streaks of ore are encountered, but no extensive rich bodies. A greatly decreased quantity of water flows from the level, consequently drifting east at the1,100-foot level below is not so much impeded, but progresses very well. The Kentuck is getting along about the same as when I last wrote, taking enough out of the upper levels to supply the Sunderland and River mills. The reopening of the drifts sent a little gas among the miners yesterday morning, but it is all right again now. One man was made a little sick, that's all.</p><p>The Overman yields between forty and fifty tons of fair grade ore per day, and is in a tolerably flourishing state. At the annual meeting of the company, held at San Francisco last Thursday, the following officers were elected: Trustees—M. J. McDonald, David Fay, A. Hemme, Louis Vessaria, W. K. Parkingson; Superintendent—J. A. Myrick; Secretary—Thomas J. Owens.</p><p>Sinking deeper in the Imperial Empire shaft is discontinued, in order to make necessary repairs to the timbering of the shaft. The old upper working of the Imperial still continues to yield about fifty tons of good ore per day, but the quantity in sight is limited and cannot hold out many months longer. The drift south toward the Holmes ground is considered certain to strike the extension of the good body of pay ore in the North Yellow Jacket, which dips north. Both the Imperial and the Empire have been in bad luck for some time past, but it is to be hoped the present new administration may develop something good.</p><p>The Savage seems to be rather weakening of late, the yield diminishing month by month. There is plenty of low grade ore in the mine, but of the high grade article, which tells the story on the bullion product, only about 8,000 tons are estimated to be in sight—vastly less than was estimated at this time last year. Considerable repairing is being done to the shaft at present. Strong hopes are entertained, by sinking deeper, of being able to strike a continuation of the same good body of ore existing at the lowest level of the Hale 7 Norcross.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross. Still flourishes healthy and strong. The upper levels yield small quantities of good pay ore, but the heavy body of rich ore at the lowest or 1,030 foot level holds out better than ever, and bids fair to extend to the center of the earth. The late dividend of $6 per share aggregates $48,000.</p><p>The Gould & Curry yields about fifty tons a day from the upper levels. Owing to the breaking of the shaft of the pump engine, a day or two since, the water has raised about one hundred feet above the seventh station, where the drift east through the ledge was being commenced.</p><p>The second regular monthly dividend on the Sierra Nevada was payable yesterday. It was only $2.50 per share, and could just as easily been made $10, but the controlling powers very wisely think best to retain a plentiful surplus in the treasury to lay in the winter's stock of wood, timber and stores which, and still maintain the regular monthly dividends. A surface tunnel north of the hoisting works will develop an unexpected continuance of the rich ore existing at the level above, and which is now being run through the mill. A considerable amount of free gold specimen ore is being daily encountered, and this month's run will evidently be even better than the last. At the meeting of the stockholders, held in San Francisco last Thursday, it was decided to increase the capital stock of the company to $3,000,000, to be divided into shares of $200 each.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi is looking exceedingly well throughout, and yields about 230 tons of ore per day with good prospects of increase both in quantity and quality.</p><p>The Ophir west drift is to-day in 422 feet from the shaft, and the rock encountered bears an improved appearance, as though the ledge was not far off.</p><p>The Coming Circus.</p><p>Young America hereabouts, and all the Piutes, little and big, are agog with expectation, and pregnant with brilliant imaginings relative to Costello's grant ""Circus, Menagerie, and Abyssinian Caravan,"" which appears here Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. The tent must be a stunner, for they couldn't find a level scrap of ground here to pitch it on without going down by the Gas Works, away below town. They say it covers a whole acre of ground. The Piutes will see an elephant for the first time—a couple of them—a little one and a big one.</p><p>ALF.SFH</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH18.jpg,sf-herald
SFH19,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, NEV., July 18, 1869.</p><p>No More of It.</p><p>Since the pretended robbery of William Weir, a couple of weeks ago, things have been pretty quiet in that line, even rumors of those illegal transactions being scarce. People now begin to breathe freer, and travel over the Divide between here and Gold Hill again same as they did before, with renewed trusting not being waylaid and robbed by muffled brigands, armed with Colt's revolvers and double-barreled shot-guns. Indeed it is now pretty generally believed that nine-tenths at least of those many rumored robberies on the Divide, during the past five or six years, are humbugs, got up by sensationally-minded individuals, just for a little cheap notoriety. Nearly a year ago, one adventurous foot-pad was reported to be waylaying stragglers at that point, directing his attention to Gold Hillers returning home from Virginia late in the evening. Thus John Kromer stated that the fellow stopped him and relieved him of two dollars and fifty cents, all the coin he had left after a jolly cruise about Virginia. Two or three evenings after that another man said that that foot-pad had stopped him and gone through him for a dollar and six bits. Now, allowing these two stories to be true, that miserable brigand was doing an extremely poor business—not making whisky money—and I really was inclined to believe them a little from the fact that shortly afterward that poor devil, or some other equally unlucky burglar, tried to get into Hazen's brick store on the Divide, probably hoping to finger a safe full of money. He broke into a blacksmith shop first and got a crowbar and other tools to operate with, and then worked hard all night prying off the iron shutter of a rear window. He dug away the brick work about the hinges, and after much severe exertion, managed to pry the shutter loose. Then he smashed out the inner window and came face to face with about 1,600 tons of barley, in sacks, piled square up before him. He laid down his tools and left in utter, hopeless disgust, and has never been heard of since. Had he succeeded in entering the store he would have found no safe or anything else worth stealing—except barley.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The latest sensation we have had in the theatrical line, was the ""Carter Dramatic Combination,"" which appeared at Piper's Opera House last Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, having just arrived from the East, per continental railroad. The ""Combination"" consisted of Mr. Carter and his wife, and they opened with ""Lucretia Borgia."" Mrs. Carter did Lucretia finely and Carter himself did Gennaro and all the rest of the characters, rendering them very creditably, too. Just let Barrett and McCullough, and all your other comparatively one-horse tragedians or comedians, take a back seat after that: there's talent and concentrated versatility for you. He did work most industriously, and by dint of rapid changes of dress and constant doubling, with considerable stretch of the imagination allowed to the audience, he contrived to represent the full cast of characters in that noted five-act tragedy. Carter is certainly a genius as well as a good actor, and his wife is really a second Mrs. Bowers in Lucretia Borgia at least. They advertised themselves very parsimoniously; therefore they had a slim house. The second night they were actually going to tackle ""Ingomar,"" with Mrs. Carter as Parthenia, and Carter personating Ingomar and all the rest of the skin-dressed barbarians in that popular piece. The idea, however, was a little too whimsical for our critical theatre-goers, and so the combination had only a $20 house. He refused to play to so small an audience, and told them he didn't think Virginia people properly appreciated true talent when they saw it. Next night, at Dayton, he refused to play to an audience of four, and the next night another mean little audience discouraged him at Carson. Mr. and Mrs. Carter are probably at San Francisco by this time, where success as members of some good dramatic company awaits them. They simply failed here in trying to speculate too heavily on too little capital. George Francis Train will be here shortly, to appear at the Opera House. Next comes Tom Thumb and wife, with Commodore Nutt and Minnie Warren, and after that something else, probably, to this deponent at present unknown.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi Fire.</p><p>The burning of the fine new hoisting works of the Chollar-Potosi Mining Company, and the extensive buildings connected therewith, last Wednesday morning, was the liveliest sensation, in that line, this city has experienced for a long time. It was a little the quickest fire I ever saw. The employees in and about the works were drilled as a regular fire company, with plenty of hose to attach to the pump of the steam engine at a moment's warning, and the alarm was given as soon as the roof, about the smoke-stack in the boiler-room, was discovered to be on fire; but notwithstanding all these precautionary arrangements, the whole thing went as though saturated with camphene. In just exactly half an hour from the time the fire commenced, the whole big building was destroyed, and the frame fell in. Our efficient firemen, with all their excellent machines, could do but little good, except in saving some of the dwellings near by. The entire loss to the company, including the large three-story boarding house near the works, a large amount of timber four hundred cords of wood, etc., is estimated at over $100,000. The amount of insurance was $40,000. Most people were under the impression that the destruction of these hoisting works would interfere with the working of the mine and the extraction of ore, but such is not the case at all. The ore comes from the upper levels, through the old Chollar works and the Potosi tunnel.  The new shaft and works were simply used in deeper prospecting and explorations. There were only four men working below, drifting at the 500 and 900-foot levels, and they made their escape by climbing down the ladders of the pump shaft to the 1,100-foot level, and out through the 1,080-foot level of the Hale & Norcross mine, by means of the drift connection made about five weeks ago. These works will probably not be rebuilt at that point, as the shaft was sunk too far west; consequently had passed through to the west wall long ago. It was always a heavy bill of expense to the company, and no particular advantage. They should not sink a new and better shaft, some hundreds of feet further east, down the hill or else combine with neighboring companies in doing so. None of them have sunk far enough east.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>An increased number of men have been worked in the Yellow Jacket mine during the past week, and over two hundred tons of ore per day extracted. The air in the south portion of the mine is better, and daily becoming more so. The winze connection between the 800 and 900-foot levels in the north mine, of which I have heretofore made mention, was completed last Monday, giving good air throughout both drifts. There is an immense body of good pay ore in that part of the mine, which will be got at shortly. That 300 feet of water in the north shaft is being slowly reduced by means of a couple of one hundred gallon bailing tubs. The shaft requires a great deal of fixing, and about forty feet of it, some three hundred feet below the surface, will have to be retimbered. When this water is all out, the shaft repaired throughout, and a winze sunk from the bottom of it at the 700-foot level to the 800 and 900-foot levels below, which will be in two or three months from now, you may look for prosperous times in the Yellow Jacket and a corresponding elevation of the stock. At the annual meeting of the company, held at Gold Hill last Monday, J. B. Winters, Wm. Sharon, D. Driscoll, T. G. Taylor and T. B. Storer were elected Trustees. This new Board then elected J. B. Winters President and Superintendent, F. F. Osbiston Secretary, and Bank of California Treasurer. They voted to donate $2,500 to the sufferers by the great mining calamity and levied an assessment of $10 per share on the stockholders. This assessment aggregates $240,000, and, added to the dividend of $5 per share declared just before the fire and subsequently rescinded, it amounts to the same as an assessment of $15 per share, aggregating $360,000, and aggravating stockholders considerably. They will have to grin and bear it, though, anyhow. They'll be all right in the fall.</p><p>Nothing new in the Crown Point. No good developments at the 1,000-foot level, rather an unpropitious circumstance for prospects at the 1,100-foot level when it shall reach the ledge. The upper levels of the Kentuck yield as usual,, and the opening being made into the lower part of the mine, below the fire, through the 900-foot level of the Yellow Jacket, is developing an extensive body of good pay ore.</p><p>Nothing new to report in the Overman, Belcher, Imperial-Empire or Bullion. The Chollar-Potosi yields over 250 tons per day. The shaft is still undergoing repairs.</p><p>The Gould & Curry yields between forty and fifty tons of $36 ore, from the old workings of the upper levels, daily, with a prospect of an increase in a few days, when the second-station drift is cleared out. Drifting east through the ledge at the seventh station was resumed last Sunday, and good progress is being made.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada mill is running steadily on pretty good ore from the surface workings of the mine, and another good clean-up will be made on the 31st, the second one for the month. The amount of this rich ore already developed is fully sufficient to keep up the present highly gratifying monthly receipts for some time to come. Both mine and mill are well managed, and run at a low rate of expense, far within the receipts, allowing a healthy state of finances. Like the majority of the mines along the Comstock, the Sierra Nevada shows little or no pay ore at the lower levels at present, but the upper levels pan out rich.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is down to the level of the Latrobe tunnel to-day, 164 feet from the surface. The work is being well and energetically prosecuted by Ross & Co., the contractors for the first 500 feet. They run out the excavated rock and earth through the Latrobe tunnel and will continue doing so till the shaft is about sixty feet deeper, using a windlass, when they will get their steam hoisting apparatus at the surface into operation.</p><p>The drift west of the ledge at the 700-foot level of the Ophir is to-day 462 feet in from the shaft. No more favorable indications are encountered. The rock works well, and good progress is made.</p><p>The Occidental is yielding as usual from the upper levels, and the new tunnel, 400 feet beneath the present lowest working level, is progressing well, the rock in the face being somewhat softer and more favorable.</p><p>The Lady Bryan has a good showing of pay ore, especially at the lower levels. The annual meeting of the company will be held August 3d, in this city.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH19.jpg,sf-herald
SFH20,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, NEV., July 18, 1869.</p><p>No Credit to be Robbed.</p><p>What's the use of being robbed or murdered unless you have the sympathy of the public with you? Now, William Weir, the bacon peddler of whom I made mention in my last letter as having been robbed at American Flat, about a week ago, of over $1,200, and everything else worth stealing he had about him, can't get anybody here to believe a word of it. This skeptical community have their own opinion in regard to the matter; so have the police. His story didn't hang together right, and he didn't act just as a man who has actually been robbed always does. Worse than that, when he went back to California and found by the papers that people over here didn't believe he had been robbed, he at once, in a fit of virtuous indignation, went before a Justice of the Peace and made an affidavit that he really had been gone through with by foot-pads, just as we described in the HERALD. If he hadn't sworn to it, there was a chance of folks believing that he truly had been robbed by highway-men, but this affidavit spoiled the whole. It is rough enough on a man to be robbed, without having to swear to it afterwards. Robberies hereabouts, especially on the divide between here and Gold Hill, have been a little too frequent and fashionable, for general and indiscriminate belief. We have seen too many who having lost their coin, etc. ""bucking against the tiger,"" were ingeniously inclined to attribute their loss to some other cause, and in fact make foot-pads on the divide a convenience in the matter, when in reality they came to a divide less irregularly; Mr. Moore, of Gold Hill, who was relieved of his watch, and $23 in coin, a week ago last Thursday night, I honestly believe to be the only case of genuine highway robbery on the divide, occurring this season, and shall continue to believe so unless he swears to it.</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>The railroad between Virginia and Carson, owned and being built by the Bank of California, and misnamed from interested motives the ""Virginia and Truckee Railroad,"" is rapidly being pushed towards completion. The longest tunnel on the route, that near American Flat, about 600 feet in length, is about finished, and that through Fort Homestead and Gold Hill soon will be. The grading being so nearly completed, the tracklaying will soon commence, and the chances are that the cars will be running over it before October. It will be used principally in transporting ores from the mines of the California Bank to Carson River, for cheaper crushing; and how much actual pecuniary benefit it is going to be to the tax-paying people of Storey county remains to be seen; although county bonds have to assist in building the road unless the people should open their eyes some day and repudiate that part altogether. Well, hurrah for the railroad anyhow.</p><p>Castello's Circus.</p><p>Dan Castello's ""Circus, Menagerie and Abyssinian Caravan"" has been here. I have seen it, and so will you soon. It performed two nights here, and to the largest houses ever seen in this section. There were nearly or quite 3,000 people present the first night, and about half that number the second night. It could not have raised a paying house the third night. The plain truth, as your readers will see, is, that the thing is terribly overrated. The ""caravan"" part is a fancy little humbug, and the ""menagerie"" is confined to a smart elephant, a mangy old camel, and five cages of strange animals, consisting of three little Asiatic lions, some monkeys, a leopard, a pelican, a zebra, a hyena, a harte-buck, a little white bull and two or three other odd things. As to the circus part, that is pretty fair, only consisting of the performing elephant, one or two very good trick ponies, two excellent riders, two or three pretty fair tumblers, no gymnasts or acrobats, a dish balancer, a cannon ball tosser, and not a single individual new feature. It is simply a third-class, charging first-class admission. It disappointed public expectation here sadly, turning out to be literally a ""great cry and little wool.""</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>During the past week the Yellow Jacket mine has flourished exceedingly, with marked improvement in every respect. An increased number of men were employed, and nearly two hundred tons per day of ore were extracted.  The air, owing to better ventilation facilities, is pretty good in the north mine. The old hoisting works over the north mine are put in complete order, and started hoisting water from the north shaft last Thursday noon. Considerable repairing and fixing is being done to the shaft, therefore, the water, which is 300 feet deep, will not be gotten rid of under two weeks at least. The winze connection will be made, as soon as possible, from the 700-foot level, where the bottom of the shaft is, to the 800 and 900-foot levels, giving the best possible draft of air throughout the mine, besides opening up extensive bodies of excellent pay ore.</p><p>Nothing new and interesting developed in the Crown Point; it still produces no ore. The Kentuck is yielding a little from the upper levels as usual, but preparations are being made to work it through the 900-foot level of the Yellow Jacket, beneath where the fire is still burning, and deeper than it was ever worked before. This is a most excellent arrangement, well acted upon.</p><p>The Belcher folks are still drifting about in the bowels of their mine with good prospects, but raising no ore. The Overman produces enough ore to pay expenses, with the aid of an occasional assessment.</p><p>The Imperial Empire shaft requires, and is receiving rather more extensive repairs that was anticipated. It will take a month yet before it will be in good fix for work. Meanwhile, neither sinking nor drifting at the lower levels is being done. An assessment of $5 per share, aggregating $20,000, was levied on the Imperial last Thursday—delinquent, August 18th.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields nearly or quite 250 tons of ore per day, and is looking well, except at the lower levels. At the annual election of the company, held last Monday, all the old officers were reelected. The number of shares of the capital stock were increased from one share to the foot to ten.</p><p>The Hale and Norcross looks healthy throughout, especially at the lower levels, and yields something over a hundred tons of ore per day. About fifty feet of the shafting is being repaired, which rather impedes the ore production at present.</p><p>The Savage Company are also repairing their shaft. No new or important developments in the mine. At the annual election of the Company, held last Thursday, all the old officers were reelected, with T. B. Shamp, Superintendent.</p><p>The broken shaft of the Gould & Curry pump engine is repaired, and the water in the mine, which had risen to the height of 325 feet, is all pumped out again to-day. Drifting east from the Seventh Station will be re-commenced forthwith.</p><p>The Virginia-Consolidated new shaft was 138 feet deep last night, and forty-eight feet farther would carry it to the level of the Latrobe tunnel, which passes within a few feet of it. The rock works easy and over five feet of the shaft are completed per day on the average.</p><p>The Ophir west drift has penetrated 425 feet from the shaft at the 700-foot level, with no material or important change.</p><p>The most flourishing and profitable mine on the whole Comstock ledge at the present time is the Sierra Nevada. It costs less than $7,000 per month to run both mine and mill, and the monthly yield is over $20,000 on the average. The first clean up for the present month was made day before yesterday. The bullion is not yet refined and assayed, but in quality it is at least fully up to the average. The mill is working away again after its regular old style on the second run of the month, and the huge surface deposit of rich ore shows ample inducements to believe that it will hold out for years. I hear it intimated that the next monthly dividend will be a considerably increased one.</p><p>Small-pox.</p><p>Morris Gregory, the young actor, is now recovering from a five weeks siege of the small-pox in this city. W. W. Hutchinson died at Gold Hill with this disease, day before yesterday. These are the only cases I know of it, hereabouts.</p><p>Fire Department Matters.</p><p>The referees of the late firemen's tournament in this city yesterday decided to award the big silver prize trumpet to Young America Engine Company, No. 2, as the victors in the hose carriage race. That company don't like the idea of their having been outsquirted on that occasion by Eagle, No. 3, which machine now wears the champion badge, so they have slug out a challenge to squirt for from $2,500 to $5,000. The Eagles flap their wings defiantly, and reply with a county challenge for smaller amounts. Much is said about various sized nozzles, ""give and take,"" ""Open butts,"" and all that sort of thing, but a match is sure to come out of it. There's fun ahead.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH20.jpg,sf-herald
SFH21,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, NEV., August 1, 1869.</p><p>About Ways and Means.</p><p>Those seven wise men from the East composing the Congressional Committee on Ways and Means have been here. And they have gone again. They didn't stay long; at any rate, it didn't take long for them to stay what time they did, and they left precious little, if any, wiser than when they came. They arrived, via Donner Lake, Carson, Warm Springs, Empire and Gold Hill, last Wednesday, consigned to William Sharon, arriving in this city about 4 P. M. They were hilarious when they left the lake, and continued so throughout the trip. They must have driven at a fast rate, too, for they contrived to kill one valuable horse, and had to have another one at Warm Springs. Neither did they lack an abundance of good whiskey to keep up their flow of spirits, and aid them in seeing doubly well the sights and resources of the country. Sharon showed them his long water chute for sending railroad ties down out of the foothills back of Carson for his railroad between there and Virginia. When he showed them the long winding, serpentine route of that railroad, crookeder than the San Joaquin River, and when they arrived at Empire he showed them two of his quartz mills, used for reducing ore from his mines in this vicinity, and the transportation of which ore to these and other mills of his on Carson River, was the main object in constructing the road. At Gold Hill he showed them the Yellow Jacket and other mines, principally owned and controlled by him, also some at Virginia; and after showing them the California Bank in this city, Sharon took them to his private residence and treated them to a sumptuous banquet, which lasted all the evening—and next morning too. They had a glorious time. They managed to get their obfusticated ideas collected sufficiently next forenoon to go with Sharon and examine the interior of the Yellow Jacket mine, and at noon they were summarily shipped off by private conveyance to Reno, en route for where they came from in the East.</p><p>Sutro Tries to Call their Attention.</p><p>Fully appreciating the importance of having this Committee take a look at his famous projected tunnel from Carson River to the Comstock Ledge, a distance of four miles, and through which these mines can all be worked to a depth of 2,000 feet or more, Adolph Sutro, the far-seeing and enterprising projector thereof, came here all the way from San Francisco just on purpose to see, converse with, and show those gentlemen all the points in the case. He tried his prettiest to edge himself in upon their attention, but Sharon was too much for him, and overshadowed all his hopes. Sutro, however is a man of resources, and so he quietly watched his opportunity and managed to secure a couple of the Committee next morning, and get them up on the roof of the International, where they put up. He spread his map before them, showed them the profiles, diagrams and estimates, and then pointed out the lay of the land, topographical localities and course of the tunnel. They were struck with the idea immediately, and agreed with Sutro in every respect. He took them on top of a high building, but he did not promise them half the stock in that tunnel if they would fall down and worship him. He talked good square sense to them, however, and they may be able to digest some of it.</p><p>Senatorial Fit.</p><p>Last Thursday evening, as Senator William M. Stewart was on the coach in front of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s, about starting for Reno, he was suddenly seized with some sort of a fit. His outcries were terrible, and quite a sensation was created for a short time. There were plenty to rush to his assistance, and he was taken at once to the International, where every requisite attention was rendered him. He was insensible for some minutes, and remained speechless for half an hour, but afterward rapidly recovered and was all right next morning.</p><p>Wanton Shooting.</p><p>Last Wednesday afternoon a drunken fellow named George Hall shot Emerson Cain, an old man nearly sixty years of age, employed as weigh-master at the Chollar-Potosi works, inflicting a very severe and dangerous wound, without any provocation whatever. Hall came past the works, and made such an awkward job of climbing a high bank near by, that some of the workmen laughed at him considerably. This irritated him so, that when he got on top of the bank he drew a six-shooter, and soon after seeing Cain come out of his office near by, he raised his pistol, took deliberate aim across his left wrist, and fired. The distance was nearly 100 yards, but the ball hit the old man in the right breast, broke a rib, and glancing around under the skin and flesh, was afterwards taken out of his back. He is doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances. As soon as Hall saw the effect of his shot he left in a hurry, but was soon afterwards overtaken and lodged in the County Jail, where he still lies awaiting the result of Cain's wound before the examination takes place. He feels that he must have been crazy. Hardly.</p><p>Sickness.</p><p>Only one case of small-pox has developed itself during this past week, but there is plenty of scarlet fever, diphtheria, cholera morbus, whooping cough, etc., especially among children, proving fatal in many instances. A sort of dumb ague, commencing with the cholera morbus, is said to be quite prevalent among the millmen on Carson River.</p><p>Weather.</p><p>We have had some pretty hot weather this season, but the thermometer has never run higher than 90 degrees in the shade; it is two or three degrees warmer at Gold Hill than here, as a general thing. During the past week we have had showers of rain nearly every day—some pretty heavy ones—which had the effect to cool and purify the air. To-day, however, it is hot and sultry again, with the thermometer at 88 degrees in the shade.</p><p>Expected.</p><p>Senator Nye is expected here within a day or two, as a telegram from him at Chicago states that he is on his way. The old ""Gray Eagle"" didn't state what he is after. A detachment of those Chicago merchants who have been prospecting and sight-seeing about California for the last two or three weeks are also expected here very shortly.</p><p>Changed His Base.</p><p>The foot-pad, said to infest the Divide between here and Gold Hill, has apparently changed the scene of his exploits to Gold Canon, half-way between Gold Hill and Silver City. Last Wednesday evening he waylaid Ed. Ruffner, engineer of the Ione mill, but, on taking a near view, let him go on, remarking, ""You are not the man I am looking for."" The next evening he waylaid John Minnoch, near the Justice-Independent works, and robbed him of his watch and chain, twelve dollars in cash and whatever else he had worth stealing. The very next evening he went to John's cabin, in that vicinity, before he got home, took the key from its usual hiding place, entered, took blankets, bedding, clock, and all except the bedstead, cookstove and water bucket. John stays at home evenings now, and swears that the scoundrel shan't carry off his cabin, too, if he can help it. That foot-pad is liable to smell powder and experience cold lead one of these nights. There's a job put up on him.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>The fire still burns in the Crown Point and Kentuck mines, but is not supposed to extend into the Yellow Jacket. All the drifts communicating with the region where the fire is are still tightly closed, but the escaping gas and smoke indicate the existence of that obstinate and unquenchable fire. It may continue burning for many a long month yet. Meanwhile the three crippled mines are being worked as best they may, the companies each striving to work under or around the fire, and with good success.</p><p>The Kentuck yields an increased quantity of better ore from its upper level, and a good opening is being made into the lower portion of the mine through the 900-foot level of the Yellow Jacket, and as there is plenty of good ore at that point, very satisfactory developments are confidently looked for. The stock has risen very materially in consequence of this move.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket yields over 200 tons per day from the 800 and 900-foot levels of the south mine and the old Yolo tunnel in the upper workings of the north mine. It will take a month yet probably before the water is all bailed out of the north shaft, as there is still 150 feet of it, and a large space of the ledge northward of the shaft has to be drained by it. There is an immense body of excellent pay ore in this portion of the mine, and in two months from now it will be coming out of there.</p><p>The Crown Point still remains a non-producing mine, and is fully entitled to a good heavy assessment soon. Money must be had to work the mine, and not a pound of ore is produced. The explorations at the 1,000-foot level, has evidently reached the vicinity of the west wall, for they struck a huge body of water last Thursday night, about two hundred feet from the shaft, which increased in spite of all pumping and bailing arrangements, and soon drove the men out of the drift, rising thee feet above the top of the station. It then began to decrease, and is now very materially reduced.</p><p>The Belcher is looking better, and showing more good ore at present than for a long time past. It will be a producing mine soon. A drift is being commenced to run northeasterly, and connect with the Crown Point 900-foot level, giving increased and important air circulation to both mines.</p><p>Some very promising developments are being made in the Justice-Independent, from the 200-foot level up. An assessment of $5 per share, aggregating $15,000, was levied last Saturday, delinquent August 24.</p><p>At the Imperial-Empire a hoisting reel was broken last Wednesday, causing a stoppage to the shaft repairs, also a great rise of water in the mine. The reel is repaired, and hoisting water is progressing to-day at a lively rate. The usual amount of ore is yielded from the upper levels.</p><p>The second clean-up of the Sierra Nevada for the present month was made yesterday, and it yielded fully up to the rich general average. This mine pays regularly and well, and the body of excellent pay ore is apparently inexhaustible. The finances of the company are in an exceedingly healthy state, and another dividend may be looked for soon. It is a good mine, well managed.</p><p>The Gould & Curry continues to yield about forty-five tons of ore per day from the upper workings, averaging about $50. The drift east through the ledge, from the seventh station, has progressed about ten feet, and is going ahead finely with no encouraging indications as yet.</p><p>I have nothing further to add, except that Tom Thumb and the rest of his little crowd are advertised to appear at Piper's Opera House next Wednesday and Thursday evenings.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH21.jpg,sf-herald
SFH22,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., August 8, 1869.</p><p>The Eclipse.</p><p>The great sensation of yesterday was the eclipse of the sun, which we sage-brush barbarians were permitted to look at, same as good Christians in other parts of the country. A big cloud got in the way just as the thing was about to commence, but soon it raised like a big drop-curtain, and all hands had a good view of the new attraction. Smoked glass and similar contrivances were in demand, and the streets were filled with people, all curiously surveying the eclipse. The Chinese style was to view its reflection in tubs and wash-basins of water. As to the Piutes, after taking numerous smoked glass observations and holding some little consultation among themselves, they shook their heads ominously and came to the conclusion that the sun was ""heap sick, and 'spose he catch 'em all black he gone dead sure."" I believe, however, that it was the general opinion of all good critics in the matter that the eclipse was well conducted throughout, and a perfect success. It might have been run for several days longer with the same degree of popularity.</p><p>Colfax To-morrow.</p><p>Vice-President Colfax and party are expected to arrive here to-morrow, and in order to give him the proper reception, committees composed of prominent citizens of Virginia and Gold Hill, and also of Odd-Fellows, are already appointed to escort them in from Reno. The freedom of the city will be donated to them, which means a free run at all the lunch-tables, and freedom from arrest in case they get too much beer on. Colfax, though, doesn't drink, at least he didn't when he was here before. There will be gay times to-morrow when Colfax comes. He will be as popular as the eclipse. It is understood to be their intention to stop here for two or three days before they go to Carson or anywhere else.</p><p>Undertaker in Mourning.</p><p>One of our city undertakers was down to Reno the other day, when he got into a small difficulty with a boy connected with the telegraph office at that place and would have slapped the boy's chops for him, only the boy up and knocked him over. When he got up again the boy would have run, but Nels Hammond and others who were near by and didn't like to see the boy rode over, patted him on the back and made him show fight again. He got that undertaker down, pounded him good, and he came back home with two of the gayest black eyes you ever saw, both being dressed in deep mourning. He thinks that telelgraph boy is a lightning striker.</p><p>A Piute Contractor.</p><p>Ike James, the well known surveyor in this city, tells the best joke on himself I have heard lately. The back yard at his residence being considerably filled up with rubbish, and in need of a good cleaning, he let the contract to an enterprising Piute warrior for $2 50, day before yesterday, with no particular stipulation as to where he should throw the dirt, other than that he would get it off the premises. Our Piute made his squaw help him and they made a splendid job of it, getting through by the middle of the afternoon. He took a look at it and never was better satisfied in his life. He paid the $2 50 willingly and considered it mighty cheap at that. It was all well enough till his neighbor Collins, the blacksmith, came home from work, when a new phase of the matter developed itself. Collins' office was built on the line of James' back yard, and confound that Indian, if he hadn't opened the back side of the vault and dumped all the dirt from the yard into it, filling it jam full, and then shut up the hole again. He said grace a few times, while Collins stood by shaking his fat sides like an old elephant with the ague. He knew 'twas no use hunting up that Indian, so he went  right off downtown and let a contract with Patsey Brown to come that very night and clean out the vault for $25. No more Piute contractors for Ike James.</p><p>Express Racing.</p><p>During the past few weeks, since Wells, Fargo & Co. hauled off their pony express between Reno and this city, the Pacific Union Express folks have been having it pretty much their own way as far as coming in ahead every evening from Reno on the arrival of the cars at that place. Wells, Fargo & Co. have been running a sort of four wheeled go-cart, called a ""buckboard,"" bringing in the United States letter mail, their treasure boxes, express, etc., at a very fast rate, yet behind the pony. The last four or five evenings, however, that two-horse buckboard has been getting after the pony pretty lively, coming into Virginia only a few seconds behind, making the distance—twenty-tree miles—in only a few minutes over an hour, with a single change of horses. The pony I think changes twice. Last evening they came in on two different streets, in order to avoid the huge crowds of waiting and excited spectators, and the buckboard is said to have passed Union street first. They certainly make big time over the road, and create a nice little daily sensation.</p><p>Fizzled.</p><p>Those challenges between some of the engine companies of the Virginia Fire Department, of which I have heretofore made mention, are apparently ending in smoke. Their mutual defiances are still published in the papers, but when they come down to business neither of them are there; at least that's the way the thing looks at present. There will be no coin put up, and there will be no trumpet race nor trial squirting. That's so. It is a fizzle.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>Of all the mines in this section, outside of the Comstock ledge, the Occidental has thus far proven itself to be the best and most reliable. The ore in it is all low grade, but very regular, extending in an unbroken sheet from the summit of the hill 600 feet down to the lowest working level, or tunnel. Winzes have been sunk over 200 feet below that, and all the way in ore of an improved quality. Indeed the ore constantly is found richer as depth is attained. A tunnel is being run from away down on the hillside, which will work the ledge 400 feet deeper than the present working level. It is already over 1,000 feet in length, and judging from the softer and more favorable character of the rock, as well as surveys, the tunnel must be near the ledge. A fine stream of water is developed by this tunnel which will be made available for mill purposes. The pay ore of the vein varies from six to twelve feet in width and there is plenty of it in sight to last for many a long year to come; besides which, an immense extension of it has been recently developed by the 600-foot, or lowest working level being run 400 feet further north, beyond the old workings. The mine looks well throughout, and the company finances are healthy.</p><p>The mines along the Comstock were never worked to better advantage as far as this side of the Divide is concerned. Those at the Gold Hill end have a dampener thrown on them by the continued disability of the Crown Point, Kentuck and Yellow Jacket on account of the fire, which still burns within their depths, yet they, in the course of a few months, will recover even from that terrible blow. North of the Gould & Curry the ledge may be set down as dead and expensive property, except in the case of the Sierra Nevada mine, which is one of the best paying of any on the whole ledge, and is worked at the least cost. It is a valuable and well managed mine.</p><p>The second clean up of the Sierra Nevada for last month yielded 411,000, and the mill is regularly at work again as usual on another run of superior ore. The yield for the present month will be even better than that of last month; the first clean up will be made on the 16th. The huge deposit of ore does not decrease, but on the contrary increases in size as working development progresses. It will take many years to work it out. The finances of the company and the excellent yield warrants another dividend soon.</p><p>The Gould and Curry still yields well from the old upper workings, about forty tons per day of $45 ore being produced, with good prospects for a still better yield shortly. Good progress is being made with the drift east at the Seventh station, near the bottom of the shaft.</p><p>The Savage is in rather a quiescent state at present. It yields considerable good ore, but the developments at the lower levels are not satisfactory. Good bodies of ore are hoped for in deeper sinkings.</p><p>Hale and Norcross is also down, owing to less yield of good ore of late. The repairs to the shaft will be completed in three or four weeks, when, with better facilities, a better yield will be the consequence. There is one splendid body of rich ore at the lowest levels, and another in the old upper workings, which assays $40 per ton.</p><p>The recent burning of the new Chollar-Potosi hoisting works did not impede the working of that mine at all or injure it; on the contrary, it has yielded better ever since, and more and richer ore is developed in the main workings. A dividend of $2 per share, aggregating $56,000 was declared last Thursday.</p><p>The water in the north shaft of the Yellow Jacket is reduced to about seventy feet. It will take a month yet to get it all out, and also the thirty feet of mud and debris at the bottom of the shaft. It will be at least two months before any ore will be taken from the north mine through this shaft. The air in the north mine is tolerably good, and it is yielding the usual amount of ore.</p><p>No good ore developments are yet made in the 1,000-foot level below, which is not near or into the west wall of the ledge. The upper levels in the west ledge are being cleaned out, in order to get at the large amounts of low grade ore known to exist there. An assessment of $5 per share, aggregating $60,000, was levied day before yesterday.</p><p>In the Belcher mine a raise 130 feet in length was completed day before yesterday from the 850 to the 730 foot level, furnishing an excellent circulation of air in that part of the mine. The proposed drift northeast to connect with the 900-foot level of the Crown Point was commenced yesterday.</p><p>The Overman yields twenty-five or thirty tons of $20 ore per day, and a very good showing of ore exists at the fourth level, improving in both quantity and quality. The prospecting going on in other parts of the mine develops nothing important in the way of more good ore just at present, although there are prospects of something better soon.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Tom Thumb crowd of little folks did splendidly here, as well as at the other town where they appeared. Piper's Opera House never was better or more fashionably attended than it was at their two entertainments given last Wednesday and Thursday evenings. The little folks were much pleased with their reception, the country, and the people; and the people were much pleased with them. They have gone your way, and you cannot fail to like them. Last evening, Miss Emma Forrestell, the wonderful female contortionist, gymnast, etc., put in her first appearance at Piper's Opera House, to a very fair audience. She was assisted by Master Tommy McLaughlin, a very good jig dancer, and Billy Wilkinson, a tolerable Ethiopian actor. She is the whole attraction, however; her two companions could not draw a corporal's guard. She can tie knots in herself, scratch her off ear with the toe of her near leg around the back of neck, and stand more pounding from a fourteen-pound hammer smashing huge stones on her breast, besides other rough usage, than any other woman that I ever saw. She is a wonders of india rubber suppleness, and, like Tom Thumb, is just from the East. You will see her soon.</p><p>George Francis Train.</p><p>Big posters stuck up to-day about the streets, everywhere, announce that ""George Francis Train is coming,"" but don't state when he is coming. 'Tis well. George is the coming man. He always was coming it over the people sensationally, and now he cometh in big letters to the land of Washoe, where flourisheth the sage brush and the silver brick. It is gratifying to know that he is coming.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH22.jpg,sf-herald
SFH23,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, NEV., Aug. 15, 1869.</p><p>Still Coming.</p><p>In a confidential conversation with Piper, last evening, he told me that George Francis Train was actually coming, notwithstanding all assertions to the contrary; that he would be here on the 20th. Now such may be the case, but I don't believe it. He has been coming for over a month, and very few here believe he is coming at all; in fact, that he is a baggage train—a carpet-bagger—and too easily run off the track, anyhow. Like the proposed grand squirting trial for ""big coin"" between some of the engine companies of the Virginia Fire Department, he is a fizzle.</p><p>Indicted.</p><p>The Grand Jury of this county have met and made their report, and the result is that Bob Dedman, arraigned for the murder of Albert Springer, has his trial set for August 30. George Hall, arraigned for the murder of Emerson Cain, trial set for September 2. Grace Kerrison, arraigned as accessory to the murder of Albert Springer, trial set for September 3.</p><p>Insurance Agents.</p><p>That old profane expression of ""thicker than fiddlers in hell"" may not be precisely applicable to the numerousness of Insurance Agents in this section. Every other man dressed in good clothes is an insurance agent, and the way they do bore a fellow and make nuisances of themselves generally, is terrific. Old residents know them pretty well and keep tolerably clear of their blandishments, but woe unto any stranger from the country who happens along. He is at once systematically assailed, and if he don't leave town without his life safely insured in some company or other, it won't be their fault. If he escapes one, another will come at him in an entirely different shape. He can't possibly escape the fourth or fifth one. Even old residents are not safe from these social nuisances at all; they attack a fellow under the garb of friendship and in the most familiar style, so that you don't know or even suspect that your friend Jones has become one of them until he begins to talk life insurance to you. They all seem well enough, of course. Your friend Jones, too, if he finds you totally impervious to his kindly attempts, will, ten chances to one, ring in a genial good fellow on you, who knows it all, and before you know it you engage to take a $10,000 endowment policy in what you are thoroughly convinced is the best and safest company in the world; yet a day or two afterward a capital good boy from San Francisco, whom you have just discovered is the prince of good fellows, develops to be a full-blooded insurance agent, and you find yourself insured for $5,000 or $10,000 in still another company, which you are easily made to perceive and fully understand by demonstrated figures and tabular statements, is a much better company than the last mentioned, which, according to the system upon which it works, you now plainly see is sure to ""bust up"" within the eleven months and a half, mathematically sure calculation. You wonder that anybody should be so ignorant and reckless as to insure in any other company, yet in less than a week you are similarly brought to the conclusive belief that some other particular company is a long way the best of all, and up goes your coin. Thus it is that I am engaged for about $250,000 worth of endowment policies in various companies, when it would be rough on me to raise coin enough to pay up the premium for a $250 policy, and begin to look with suspicion on all well-dressed or sharp-looking chaps I make the acquaintance of, lest they should turn out to be insurance agents. Oh ! They approach you in all styles of shape and conversation, and hit you over your guard before you know it or think of fending off. The next insurance company should be one against being bored to death by insurance agents. One insuring against losses speculating in mining stocks would do well over here.</p><p>Stocks Down.</p><p>I don't know whether stocks have reached bottom or not, but they are certainly mighty low at present—away below zero. Most of the mines are now quoted below their actual merits, but some are not. These last are those which never or seldom have paid a dividend, and when they did had to assess the stockholders to do it. Some never have paid a dividend, and never will; and others, even those considered among leading mines, which have paid dividends in times past, will never do so again, according to present developed prospects. There is hope for all, though, and let us always hope for the best. For true, unbiased information on this particular subject, let your readers always read and critically consider our</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>Inside of three weeks the water and mud will all be out of the Yellow Jacket north shaft, and after the timbering thereof is properly repaired, which will take two or three weeks longer, and a winze is sunk to the 800-foot level, that portion of the mine will be in a proper condition for advantageous working. It contains a vast body of good paying ore at the lower levels. The south mine yields about 150 tons of ore per day from the lower levels, and the old Yolo tunnel in the surface workings of the north mine yields fifty tons. The Yellow Jacket is a good mine, and will come out all right this winter. The Crown Point yields nothing, as usual, and same as it has done for many a long month. No ore is developed at the 1,000-foot level, and still less at the 1,100. It was yielding but little ore, and looking rather sick before the fire, and since then it has yielded nothing and looks worse. It may recuperate and produce, by and by, but not just yet. It is a year next month since it paid a dividend.</p><p>The Kentuck still yields ore enough from the upper levels to run the Sunderland and Pioneer mills, and a winze connection of 100 feet was completed last evening from the 900-foot or lower level of the Yellow Jacket, up to the 800-foot or lower level of this mine, thus opening out good facilities for increased ore extraction, as well as a much needed circulation of air at that point. The Kentuck is fast recovering from the effects of that fatal fire, which still burns, hemmed in with certain and impassable boundaries.</p><p>The Overman has a huge body of 425 ore developed at its 400-foot level, sixty feet wide and over thirty feet high; now much larger it is will be found out as further development progresses. The mine yields about twenty-five tons per day, but will increase on that soon.</p><p>Nothing new to report in the Bullion or the Imperial-Empire. Both are doing the best possible with poor present prospects. The old Imperial yields about fifty tons per day, and the Empire about thirty.</p><p>The average yield of the Chollar-Potosi is about 200 tons per day; the assays of which average over $50. The mine is looking well throughout, and new bodies of good ore are being developed. The yield will be increased during the next week or two.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross yields about 100 tons per day on the average, principally from the fourth station, or next to the lowest level. Considerable ore is also coming from the upper levels. The yield from the lower levels will be better when the repairs to the shaft are completed.</p><p>The Savage is rather on the sick list, the yield dropping off very considerably during the last few weeks, both in quantity and quality. The prospect for more ore in sinking from the lowest level deeper is not good according to present indications. The ore dips south into the Hale & Norcross.</p><p>The Gould & Curry yields, as usual, about fifty tons of $45 ore from the old upper workings. The drift east, through the ledge at the lowest level, is getting along well.</p><p>The Ophir tunnel, being run west from the new shaft, at the 700-foot level thereof, is now in about 530 feet, with poor prospects of ever striking anything.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada still runs along at its regular old rate, paying regular monthly dividends, without fail, and with a prospect of long continuance, judging from the excellent management and the vast amount of ore in sight. The first clean-up of the mill for the present month will be made tomorrow, and it will be a good one.</p><p>The Occidental also gets along admirably, and not only pays its way, but pays for all improvements and prospecting. It is one of the regular paying mines of the county, and never calls for assessments. The new lower tunnel, over 1,000 feet in length, is in proximity to the ledge, and will cut it 400 feet below the present lowest working level. Great expectations are indulged in regarding it.</p><p>Theatricals.</p><p>The Murphy and Mack Minstrels arrived yesterday, and put in their first appearance at Piper's Opera House last evening. They are billed to appear at Salt Lake just as soon as they can get there, where a good reception awaits them; therefore they will only appear here once more—this evening. They had a $750 house last evening, and will have another big one to-night. Our theatre-goers are much pleased with them. They should, however, run a little more on the great talent, both vocal, delineative and instrumental, that they are possessed of, and not at all on little trashy plays, which people of refined taste do not care to see more than the first time at most. Our people always appreciate, admire, and will patronize true talent. I don't know what comes next, unless George Francis Train does—the Martinettis, perhaps.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH23.jpg,sf-herald
SFH24,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA, Nev., August 22, 1869.</p><p>Little Fiddlers.</p><p>Either this has been an extraordinary good season for little fiddlers, or else there has been an unusual exodus of them from all parts of the world, for they certainly have appeared here in marvelous numbers during the last few months. Here they come, little girls and little boys, and the way they do torture that sacred instrument, the fiddle, is a caution to Ole Bull. I never knew till now how small a boy could play the fiddle, but having seen several little exiles from Vesuvius and other Italian volcanoes, travelling the county, playing on fiddles bigger than themselves, I conclude that there is no limit to their capacity. Little bits of boys and little bits of girls invade this section with fiddles, travelling about the streets from one saloon, store or dwelling house to another, and will insist on giving you a tune or so, whether you like it or not, fully expecting you to disburse a bit or so therefore, anyhow. And they do murder poor ""Captain Jinks,"" slaughter ""Champagne Charlie,"" climb over the ""Flying Trapeze,"" and devastate the ""Grecian Bend"" in a manner debilitating to contemplate. Organ-grinders this season have been limited exclusively to those travelling with maimed soldiers, and the entire amount of vagrant music is monopolized by little fiddlers.</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>The railroad between here and Carson, misnamed the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, is not progressing very fast in construction at the present time. Considerable grading has yet to be done, but as the iron for the track will not arrive for six or eight weeks yet, Sharon & Co. have concluded not to push things too fast, but to wait awhile and so save the use of the money. They have taken off the hands employed on the last tunnel near Virginia, which can be finished in a week, and during the next three or four days will discharge 600 Chinamen and over 200 white men. It will not require a very large force to complete the grading. The track-laying will not be done so fast as one the great continental railroad, as there are no straight lines worth speaking of, but most of the rails will have to be curved. It is the crookedest road anybody ever saw.</p><p>The Sutro.</p><p>Adolph Sutro, the famous projector of a certain tunnel between Carson River and the Comstock ledge, is here. He is trying to put his grand project through now, by means of small subscriptions from miners, or anybody else who will take small or large amounts of the stock. That is his best chance of success now, as for interested reasons, the capitalist are averse to investing in it, regarding it with an unjustifiable degree of jealousy. This tunnel certainly is a very important work, and would be a great advantage to the country. Through it to Carson River is less than four miles, straight track, and the tunnel once completed, cars could be run backward and forward regularly, regardless of snow, rain, or any other vagary of the elements, at all seasons of the year. It would also tap the Comstock mine hundreds of feet deeper than the present lowest workings, and afford the best possible drainage. Sutro has fought against all manner of discouragements for a long time, but that tunnel will eventually be run whether Sutro has anything to do with it or not. You can just chalk that down as a settled point.</p><p>The Occidental Mine.</p><p>Day before yesterday I paid a visit to this famous ""outside"" mine. I was all through it six months ago, but considerable development has been made since then, and I thought it required another critical inspection. The lower working level, 600 feet from the surface, has been extended several hundred feet further north—1,200 feet in all. The extreme north end of the main drift show the same continuous sheet of ore so prevalent and unbroken throughout all other parts of the mine, and so characteristic of it. ""Raises"" have also been made to the extent of sixty feet above this new work, simply developing the same thing; in fact, this mine is practically inexhaustible, there being now enough ore in sight to last for many a long year to come. It is all low grade ore, but pays very evenly, is extracted cheaper than any other in the country, mills easily, containing little or no base metal, and yields a small profit to the ton. The yield of bullion is simply limited by the amount of ore worked. About forty men are employed in and about the mine. The body or vein of ore is in one continuous, unbroken sheet, from two to twelve feet thick, extending from the croppings at the summit of the hill, 600 feet down to the 600 foot or lower working level. Winze sunk 250 feet below this develops merely a continuation of this ore, but it is found to be somewhat richer as depth is attained. How far it extends northward is not of course known at present. No assessments ever have to be levied, the mine being a self-sustaining institution, paying for all prospecting, improvements, etc., and the day is fast approaching when the Occident will occupy a prominent position in the front rank of dividend-paying mines. I base this opinion upon actual observation of the present developments, and the new measures progressing for opening out new facilities and putting the mine in still better producing shape.</p><p>The tunnel of which I have heretofore made mention as being run from the ravine down below the ore dump of the mine, to strike and open the ledge 400 feet beneath the present lowest working level of the mine, is progressing very well, being steadily worked by six men on eight-hour shifts, two men on a shift. The rock, however, is very hard, so that they can only make about a foot in twenty-four hours on the average. A contract was let yesterday to run the tunnel fifty feet further, which will probably carry it to the ledge, as there is every indication that it is close to it, and judging from the ""feeders"" or stringers of quartz encountered within the last few days, it is apparently in the foot wall of the lead. Both giant and black powder is used in blasting. This tunnel is a little over 1,000 feet in length, and within the last few feet, a material change in the character of the rock is noticeable, also indicating the ledge to be near at hand. Great anticipations are indulged in relative to what will be developed by this tunnel. Some weeks ago a fine stream of water was tapped, which has settled down not to about fourteen inches. This is made to turn a water-wheel at the mouth of the tunnel, driving a fan, which, by means of a long tube, supplies fresh air to the farthest end of the tunnel. The water, after serving this purpose, is then led in a small flume around the hillsides and supplies two or three mills at or near Silver City. Everything connected with the Occidental mine is under excellent and fully competent management, therefore, it has a perfect right to be a success.</p><p>Other Mines.</p><p>The north shaft of the Yellow Jacket will be rid of water, mud, etc., in about two weeks longer, when an incline will be opened from the 700 to the 800-foot levels, and the extraction of ore will be commenced. The south part of the mine is yielding as usual. The present assessment of $10 per share became delinquent on the 18th instant. I hear it hinted that another similar assessment will be levied as soon as it can be legally done, as the expenses have been in excess of the receipts for some time past, and still are so. That probably will be the last assessment, for the good ore in the north mine will make things all right as soon as it can be got at advantageously.</p><p>The Chollar Potosi shows an improved yield at present; about 230 tons per day being extracted; average assays, $45 per ton. The new shaft where the hoisting works were burnt is being repaired and put in order for future use. The Sierra Nevada mine is progressing excellently, as usual, and the mill is pounding away on another run of extra good ore. The next clean up, at the last of the month, will be a highly gratifying one.</p><p>No ore is developed as yet by the drift east in the lower level of the Gould & Curry mine from the seventh station. The old upper workings yield about fifty tons of $40 rock per day.</p><p>The repairs to the Imperial-Empire shaft are nearly completed. It was badly caved between the 1,000 and the 1,100 foot stations, but is nearly all solidly re-timbered, both sinking deeper and drifting southward will be resumed shortly.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is to-day 245 feet deep, and excellent progress is being made, the rock being of a very favorable character. It is the best piece of work in that line I ever saw, the timbering being especially well done. Thoroughly practical workmen have that job in hand, and are putting it through energetically.</p><p>The Belcher mine shows a great degree of improvement generally during the past two or three weeks. A good body of ore over 100 feet long and five or six feet wide is developed near the south line above the 300 foot level, assaying over $100 per ton. A contract is let to run the 850 foot level 100 feet farther south.</p><p>White Pine.</p><p>The fabulously rich new Silverado is not in so good repute here as it was, from the fact that the greater part of those who joined in the rush for there last fall and spring have got back; and even the latest arrivals during the past week all agree that White Pine is a bursted bubble, and for true, substantial merit is no more to be compared to Virginia or Gold Hill than New Jersey is to California. They all tell of hard times and great scarcity of money out there, and express themselves delighted to get back to old Washoe. White pine will doubtless be a good country next year, but it isn't now.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>George Francis Train will show at Piper's Opera House, commencing Tuesday evening next. How many lectures he will give will be limited and regulated by his first successes. If he gets cabbaged and rotten-egged the first night, he will have crowded houses for a week. The Murphy & Mack Minstrels are doing a fine business at Salt Lake, and are to be back here, to perform at the Opera House, on the 1st and 2d of September. The Martinettis are coming on the 6th, and will draw crowded houses for ten nights or more. Lotta will probably come next, and Elise Holt about the last of the month; so you see we will not lack for good theatricals over here in the land of the sage-brush and the silver-brick.</p><p>Belligerent Piutes.</p><p>A couple of Piutes got into a quarrel on South C street, yesterday forenoon, all just because one of them had run off with the other one's wife and daughter. The Mormonish culprit was fiercely collared, but fearing the police, further demonstrations were desisted from, and both agreed to go out in the hills and fight it out. They went to a secluded spot, and inside fifteen minutes tore each other's shirts completely off, when both expressed themselves satisfied and threw up the sponge.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH24.jpg,sf-herald
SFH25,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA CITY, September 5, 1869.</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>The railroad between here and Carson, misnamed the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, is in rather a quiescent state at the present time. Before George Francis Train came here, there were 2,500 men of all sorts employed on that road, but now there are scarcely 500. I don't mean by this statement to give the impression that George has slaughtered the road—he is too light a Train to crush down any railroad—but the fact of it is that the grading is nearly completed and they are only waiting for the iron, which is now fully due, when the track-laying will be proceeded with at once. Some people affect to think that this extensive cessation of work on the road is owing to the Bank of California getting cramped for money. But this is not so.</p><p>The Pandering Train.</p><p>Just as might have been expected from the way George Francis Train tried to ride the winning horse while here at Virginia, pandering to whatever he recognized as the prime local power, he has done the same at Salt Lake. You will recollect that I stated in my last letter that if he talked woman's rights out there, same as he did here, old Brigham would cave his head in for him. But no, the time-serving George didn't have anything at all to say about woman's rights out there, except to tell them they were all right as they were. On the contrary, he went the whole Mormon hog, and indorsed them in all their peculiar institutions. If Brigham had thought him worth while, he would have anointed his bumps with sweet oil and taken him into the bosom of the church. But no, the Mormons simply let him go on and talk, while some of them did the listening. He pandered to them in every way, yet he got rather poor houses and poorer pay that he ever experienced before in all his lecturing. Says he"" I say you have been the most outraged people on the face of the globe, and if our Government dares to interfere in the future with any of your notions, you must fight. You remember how, in 1857, six hundred Mormons, at the head of Echo Canon, kept an entire army at bay. If you could frighten them under such circumstances, what can you do now, with 100,000 Mormons ready to fight for their religion and rights?"" Of course those obstreperous people were hugely tickled at this idea, whatever their private opinion might have been. George was simply playing for the Mormon vote. That's his style. If the wild, hostile Indians on the Plains had a vote he would go among them at once, advocate their cause like a Major and have them scalp the Quaker Commissioners forthwith. George won't do. He will hardly be President in 1872.</p><p>Disabled Firemen.</p><p>Owing to the frequent fires occurring here lately, there are more crippled and injured firemen than I ever saw before. Engines or hose carriages get away with them in running down our steep cross streets, and so they get run over or dragged, or else they get burnt by running straight into the fire. You never saw the like; they just deliberately walk into the flames with their pipes, stand it like salamanders, and afterward, when the cooked skin and flesh peels off or festers on the side of their faces or hands, they wonder how it was done. A fire here generally starts out in good, respectable style, but ends ingloriously—our firemen are too much for it.</p><p>Weather.</p><p>Here in Washoe the weather at this season of the year is the very best. We are enjoying our regular ""Indian summer."" We have no birds to sing among the trees, and no trees for any birds to sing among; but rich, temperate, clear, pleasant days, just warm enough and just cool enough—and such glorious nights for sleeping! This suits Crooks, and is considerable of a quietus on the</p><p>Bed Bugs.</p><p>I don't know why it is exactly, but, although fleas are plenty throughout California, we have none of them this side of the mountains at all. They won't live here, but bed-bugs do. Those infernal stinking little nuisances thrive here and multiply at a disgusting rate. Cheap lodging houses are full of them, and even first-class hotels cannot always be kept entirely free from them. They are in nine-tenths of the houses in this city, and they abound in every roadside tavern throughout the country; they are worse, however, in Dayton, Carson, Reno and other valley towns than in this elevated region. They are simply indigenous to the country, and can never be wiped out entirely. There is one thing for comfort, though, they don't follow a person about and bite in the daytime like fleas do.</p><p>White Piners.</p><p>The White Piners are coming back at a pretty plentiful rate just now. They have got chloride enough, and are looking for winter quarters. Quite a lot of printers have got back within the last two weeks. Of the three newspapers out there, only one, the Inland Empire, will live till next spring. The Telegram is dead, and the White Pine News will be a weekly in two months; it is pretty weakly now.</p><p>Mining Items</p><p>Quite a stir was made day before yesterday, relative to a reported rich strike in the Overman mine, and the stock took a jump of $6 per foot in consequence; yet, after all it was not justified by the facts of the case. They certainly did find some very good ore at the 500-foot level, but not a very large body of it. The Overman abounds in low grade ore, with occasional isolated bunches of rich ore among it; these, however, are like angels' visits—""Few and far between."" The general average of the best ore does not yield $25. A huge body of fair milling ore is developed at the 400-foot level, which breasts out 60 feet in width. I saw an assay from it yesterday, which showed $45 to the ton. The yield of the mine is increased to 60 tons per day, averaging $20 per ton, but, as I have before stated, no new and rich discovery is made in it at present. The air is very bad at the 500-foot level, therefore little work is being done there. A winze is being excavated to connect this and the level above, which will be finished in about ten days, giving a good circulation of air.</p><p>I have nothing new to report relative to the Crown Point mine. It still continues to yield no ore, and none is yet developed at either of the lowest levels—the 1,000 and the 1,100. A small streak of good ore was found at the 1,000 foot level, but it did not amount to anything. A ""raise"" at that point might develop good ore above that level, but the prospects below are decidedly not good.</p><p>The Kentuck upper levels continue to yield a goodly quantity of fair grade ore, enough to supply two mills, and some very good ore is being developed at the 900-foot level, through the same level of the Yellow Jacket. The fire still burns in the mine, somewhere about the 600-foot level.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket yields about 240 tons of ore per day from the lower levels of the south mine, and the old Yolo tunnel in the surface workings of the north mine. There remain to-day fourteen feet of water and mud to get out of the north shaft before the track floor of the 700-foot level is reached. Owing to a considerable increase of water-flowing, progress is necessarily slow, and it will take probably a couple of seeks yet before that shaft can be cleared out.</p><p>The repairs to the Imperial-Empire shaft are completed down to the 1,080-foot station, and it is not supposed to be much injured below there. Drifting southward toward the Holmes ground at that level will be resumed to-morrow. The old workings of the upper levels continue to yield at their usual rate—some 60 or 70 tons per day.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields 225 tons of good paying ore per day, principally from the old Blue Wing section. At the northern end of the New Tunnel section quite a body of extra good ore has recently been developed. A dividend of $2 per share was declared last Monday, payable to-morrow.</p><p>The Hale and Norcross shows a greatly increased yield at present, nearly or quite 200 tons per day being extracted. Over half of this comes from the fifth or lower level, which by the completion of the repairs to the shaft is once more brought into productive service. A new pump is being put in, and very shortly the shaft is to be sunk 100 feet deeper in order to open another level.</p><p>The savage is paying expenses, but does not show well at the lower levels. About 6 o'clock last evening, the pump-bob broke at the seventh station; it will take four or five days to repair it. This will stop work at the lower level, but above there it will be proceeded with as usual.</p><p>Nothing but porphyry and clay, with here and there a thin streak of quartz, is yet found in the drift east at the lower level of the Gould and Curry. The old upper workings yield nearly 40 tons of ore per day, averaging $38 per ton.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is 274 feet deep to-day. Very little water is yet encountered, and excellent progress is made. The new hoisting works operate well.</p><p>The Ophir drift has penetrated 575 feet west from the shaft, with nothing new or encouraging yet encountered.</p><p>A large quantity of excellent ore, filled with free gold, has recently been developed in a drift west from the surface workings of the Sierra Nevada, and another rich streak, three feet wide, is developed in the car track tunnel. The mill is being run on ore from both these places, and an extra good yield is therefore looked for this month. The regular monthly dividend will be declared to-morrow or next day. It is a profitable mine.</p><p>The Occidental mine, it is unnecessary to state, continues its regular yield. There never has been an assessment upon it, and probably never will be. The face of the lower tunnel is undoubtedly in the west casing of the ledge, penetrating it to the extent of over thirty feet; yet as the tunnel is being run at an angle of about twenty degrees, or comparatively parallel with the ledge, it has not in reality approached the ledge more than twelve feet from the outside of the casing. It is gradually nearing the ledge and will probably cut it by next Sunday.</p><p>The Lady Bryan yields about forty tons of $25 ore per day, a streak of gold-bearing ore, five feet wide and assaying as high as $200 to the ton, is developed by a wins, forty-five feet below the surface. Sinking the main shaft deeper will be resumed in four or five days, and a new station opened at the sixty-foot level. About the 10th instant the mill will be started running again.</p><p>The Union mine, Silver City, yields about $10,000 per month, and is being actively worked. It is purely a gold vein, and the ore is worked at the Ione mill, and arastras on Carson River. The mine is principally owned by S. A. Chapin, Esq., of Silver City, and certainly is a very lucrative piece of property.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Murphy and Mack minstrels performed to good audiences at Piper's Opera House on Wednesday and Thursday evenings last, and then left for the Bay. They took well with our theatre-goers—Ben Cotton especially with his pretty little mouth, jolly laugh and gay song of ""Love Among the Roses."" The Martinettis open at the Opera House to-morrow evening for a two-weeks' run. They will take well.</p><p>Religious Troupe.</p><p>A little stub of a stray preacher, with two ladies, arrived this morning from the East, and this afternoon they collected quite a big crowd in front of the International, on C street, by singing, after the style that a band wagon collects customers to the circus, and then the little preacher preached to the crowd. After he was through the three went about giving away little tracts. No collection was taken up, therefore, I couldn't see the margin for the profits. It will probably be soon developed. They are coming your way soon.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH25.jpg,sf-herald
SFH26,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>VIRGINIA CITY, September 12, 1869</p><p>Incendiaries About.</p><p>Within less than a month past we have had no less than five fires here in this city, all of them the work of incendiaries. From two to a dozen building were burned each time, and, as you may well suppose, the Fire Department here is getting to be exceedingly well practiced, and ever on the lookout. It is well they are, for just give a fire half a show at the present time, when everything in the shape of lumber and wood is as dry as tinder and equally ready to catch fire on the least spark of provocation, and away goes half the city at least. Unoccupied buildings are selected in which to start the fire, yet in the last instance, which was last Thursday evening, a little building at the corner of C and Mill streets, in which three men were sleeping, or at least abed, was set on fire. Two of the men escaped; but the third, a deaf old fellow, named Lorentz Ackerman, after coming out once, went back after his blankets, and either got suffocated or confused, or both, and was taken from the ruins next morning a blackened human cinder. He was a native of Germany, aged sixty years. It is a terrible pity that some of these infernal scoundrels, who set these fires just out of pure mischief, or from a worse motive, could not be caught in the act. His term of life would be particularly short, and his trial would not cost the county a cent.</p><p>Scarcity of Water.</p><p>In common with Philadelphia and New York, Virginia is also complaining of a scanty supply of water at the present time. The springs are getting exceedingly low throughout this section, and therefore, as this city is dependent on three or four springs for the requisite supply of water, we have to economize in the use of that desirable fluid all possible. Many people are growling at the water company as though they were in fault, yet how can the company help it? They can't make water, but simply furnish all they can procure. They are now arranging for a further supply by pumping out the shaft of the Mexican mine, which is full of water. This will, however, be furnished to some of the mills which are now supplied from the same source that the city is. Meanwhile it would be well under the present circumstances, for the people of Virginia and Gold Hill to exercise due economy in not only water but whisky, for it is a well known fact that no scarcity of water was complained of in Philadelphia until the great whisky conflagration of some five weeks ago, whereby 25,000 barrels of that popular beverage was destroyed. The inference is that the natives of that city have been obliged to run on water ever since in place of whisky, and hence the scarcity, extending its influence even to New York and Boston. The Philadelphians, probably, found water excellent to use with soap in washing themselves, but now they find it good to drink.</p><p>More Rich Discoveries.</p><p>I got a letter from a friend at White Pine, the other day, which informs me that they have just opened a ledge which was discovered a few weeks ago some three miles north of Hamilton, and within a quarter of a mile of the Elko road. They found some very rich ore in it, and an assay of it gave nearly $11,000 to the ton. If it only turns out one-fifth as well as that on the average, the old Eberhardt will have to subside into third class ore compared with it. Of the extent of the ledge or name of the claim, I am not yet advised, but will be in a day or two. Nearly a week ago a prospector from away down in the Pahranagat region, showed me some very rich ore he has found about 90 miles north of Collville, on the Colorado. He calls it antimonial silver, and says it assayed in Austin, or somewhere out in that section, $2,100 to the ton. The ledge is three feet wide, of unknown extent or depth, and, so far as prospected, opened out all the same as the specimens he showed me. It shows no rock, but only the metal itself. Having my own opinion in the matter I got some assays of it made for my own private satisfaction, and the result was from $30 to $50 per ton only in silver. It is simply antimonial galena, with some silver in it. It certainly is very rich in lead, and whittles almost like the pure metal.</p><p>Only yesterday, a friend just in from Walker River showed me a sack-full of the richest copper ore I ever saw in this section. It came from a new discovery he has made within five miles south of Walker Lake. The ledge is only about a foot wide, but apparently must be nine-tenths copper, judging from these specimens. Indeed, some pieces showed native copper, and all of it was of the richest red and black oxide character.</p><p>Wonderful Meat and Bone Shower.</p><p>My friend from Walker Lake has a marvelous story to tell about a great shower of bones and meat which occurred there on the 4th of August. It was just after dark. The day had been very sultry and close, with a few large, sullen clouds glowing about the horizon, occasionally brightened with a flash or so of heat lightning. My friend was sitting with the three others composing the prospecting party, at the foot of a broad scrub cedar tree, smoking their pipes after the evening meal, when suddenly there was a great rushing noise overhead, and down came a terrific shower of bones and meat, which lasted nearly a minute, he would judge. The boys kept snug under that tree till morning, when they took a critical inspection of the matter. It was a bona fide---or bonified—occurrence, and no mistake. There lay bones and fresh meat scattered over an area of nearly half a mile. Rib, thigh and shin bones, and even whole heads with the horns on, and large chunks and strips of beef, whole livers, hearts, haslets, etc., were strewn about a few rods apart. Judging from the long sheep horns, shape of the bones, quality of the meat and other peculiarities, they came to the wise and correct conclusion that these were the actual remains or pieces of Los Angeles cattle—a conclusion fully corroborated by the newspaper accounts of a great shower of meat and blood occurring at that place on the 3d of August, the day previous. My friend and his companions account for the strange phenomenon thus: An immense army of buzzards must have found a lot of dead cattle near Los Angeles, and tearing off whatever suited them from the carcasses, they scattered blood, etc., over the town as they carried and flew off together—perhaps, frightened by coyotes---and when they got to Walker Lake, some peculiar electrical condition of the atmosphere caused them all to let go their booty; hence the shower. Those who carried the heads were probably the leaders, or head buzzards of the flock.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>Stocks are very firm at present rates, with a tendency to rise. This is owing to better prospects, increased confidence, and an easier money market. In all these respects there will be an improvement before next spring.</p><p>Of all the mines along the Comstock, the Sierra Nevada has the best thing in surface ore I know of, and is worked with the least expense and most profit; hence the regular monthly dividends. The entire monthly expenses of the Company, including mining, milling and everything, are less than $6,000, while the monthly receipts of bullion are from $12,000 to $20,000, and sometimes more. It is easy to figure on continued dividends at that rate. The last regular monthly dividend of fifty cents a share was payable on the 10th inst. These are not very large dividends, it is true, but they constitute a heavy percentage on the price of the stock. In addition to the already immense quantities of good pay ore of which I have heretofore made mention as already developed in the surface deposits, they have within the last two or three weeks developed a regular vein of ore, rich in free gold, from eight to twelve feet wide, in the southerly branch of the car track tunnel. It runs northwest and southeast, and doubtless extends to the surface, and how much below the level of the tunnel is not yet ascertained; neither is its length known yet, although it has been drifted upon some 40 or 50 feet. It has only been worked or raised upon some 15 feet above the tunnel as yet. No blasting is required, it being of the soft decomposed ore and gravel character, yielding readily to picks and gads. At the westerly end of the surface pit, another huge body of similar ore has also recently been developed, showing 30 feet in width thus far, and it is upon ore from this and the other new body of ore I have mentioned that this mill is being run at present, therefore something extra in the way of good receipts are anticipated this month. There is enough ore already in sight in these two developments to last several months, to say nothing of the other deposits already found, and which it will take years to work out. The ore is extracted with extreme facility, run in cars directly form the mine into the mill, and, being gold ore, needs no regular pan process in the working, as in silver ore. The free gold is caught in amalgamated copper plates, and the sulphurets caught from the tailings, in running through several hundred feet of blanket sluices, are worked in a couple of pans. The underground workings of the mine are well ventilated, and everything about both mine and mill is conducted in a very orderly, systematic, economical and profitable manner.</p><p>The drift west at the 700-foot level of the Ophir is 570 feet in from the shaft, and the face is in hard, dry, gypsomized porphyry. Nothing promising developed as yet.</p><p>-The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is just 280 feet deep to-day. No increase of water is yet encountered; all there is, being easily hoisted out with the soft rock and clay. Ross & Co., the contractors for the first 500 feet, are prosecuting the work with great energy, sinking at the rate of two and a half feet per day, and timbering and finishing up the same in a  thorough workmanlike manner as they go. Their new steam hoisting works operate finely—hence their excellent progress.</p><p>Some little increase of good ore is found in the old upper-workings of the Gould & Curry, but the lower tunnel still show no sign of promise.</p><p>The monthly receipts of the Savage continue falling off. The receipts for August were $32,400, a decrease of $18,400 from the July receipts. Nothing encouraging is found at the lower levels.</p><p>The present yield of the Hale & Norcross is about 150 tons per day, some little falling off from last week. Considerable water is encountered in drifting westward, at the fifth level, but it is gradually decreasing.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields about 180 tons of ore per day, averaging over $50 per ton. An extensive body of extra good ore is developed in the northern portions of the Blue Wing and New Tunnel sections, averaging nearly $100 to the ton.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket yields some 200 tons from the Yolo tunnel. About the last of this week the mud and water will be reduced in the old north shaft to the track-floor of the 700-foot section. With the present yield of the mine the financial condition of the company is kept healthy, and Yellow Jacket stock is considered good to hold.</p><p>There is nothing new or important to report in the condition of either the Kentuck or the Crown Point mines since last week; the same may be said of the Overman.</p><p>The lower tunnel of the Occidental mine cut the ledge last Tuesday, but has only penetrated it over five or six feet, owing to the angle at which it is struck. The ore looks well and assays well, considering that it is merely the outskirts of the ledge, and not in the regular pay ore struck at all. The ledge at that point should be, and doubtless is, 60 feet or more in width. Every foot of progress with this tunnel shows better ore, and as it cuts the ledge 400 feet below the present lowest workings, an immense amount of ore is doubtless by it, as the pay ore struck in this ledge is unfailing and continuous throughout—exceeding regularity being the marked feature of the Occidental.</p><p>The Lady Bryan is yielding some extraordinary good ore at the present time, and this month's receipts are expected to be more than last month, which amounted to $18,000. The mine is looking very well throughout, and everything connected with it or the affairs of the Company are being economically and well conducted under the present management. A meeting of the Company will be held in this city day after to-morrow to consider a proposition for increasing the capital stock and number of shares.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Martinetti's commenced at Piper's Opera House last Monday evening, with a large audience, but they are playing to rather thin houses just now. They produce the Green Monster next Tuesday evening, and if that does not draw good houses their engagement will not be a profitable one. Piper has gone down to your city to secure other talent and better attractions. Lotta would draw well here, with a good company.</p><p>ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH26.jpg,sf-herald
SFH27,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD]</p><p>VIRGINIA CITY, September 19, 1869</p><p>Sutro's Tunnel.</p><p>To-morrow evening, Adolph Sutro, the famous projector of the proposed tunnel from near Carson River to the Comstock Ledge, a distance of nearly four miles, and cutting the aforesaid ledge nearly 2,000 feet beneath the croppings thereof, is going to give a free public lecture on the subject at Piper's Opera House in this city. He will do the best he can to convince everybody of the truly vast importance this tunnel is to the mining interests of everybody here, and how impossible it will be to work the Comstock profitably at that depth without the Sutro Tunnel. It is my firm conviction, and has been for years, that this tunnel is absolutely necessary, and will have to be made sooner or later, but judging from past success and present promise, I begin to doubt Sutro's ability to carry it through to a successful completion. His business engineering talent and judgment are not good. He has managed poorly or he might have got the tunnel fairly started years ago, and a good portion of it completed, instead of being as it is now, nearly a grand project on paper. I wish him well, nevertheless.</p><p>Rich Assays.</p><p>I had some ore sent me three or four days ago to get assayed. It was from the Minnesota claim, three miles north of White Pine, near Morton & Wells' Three-mile Station, on the Elko road—a new discovery, of which I made mention in my last. Pulverizing what was sent me, I gave a third of it each to Wiegand & Co. and Ruhling & Co., Gold Hill, and the other third to Bousfield & Co., Virginia. The three assays turned out within about $100 of each other, and averaged a little over $3,500 to the ton. It certainly is very rich, even for White Pine, and if the fortunate proprietors can only find enough of it, they have got a fortune. They speak of their claim, however, as containing only two pay streaks of this ore, from one inch to ten inches in width. This is near the surface, but how much more abundant the ore may prove on sinking deeper remains to be seen. They propose getting out a few tons and sending it to be worked in some mill. This is the only sensible way of testing it, for ore assays in a new district are generally promising and fallacious humbugs; they won't do to bet on.</p><p>Musical.</p><p>Most all the musicians who went from here to White Pine last fall, winter and spring, have returned, glad to bet back where employment and pay is more sure. Musicians were scarce here for a while last summer, aside from the little foreign boy and girl fiddlers who perambulated the streets, going about scraping fiddles as big as themselves in hopes somebody would give them two bits to get clear of them. Speaking of music, I want to tell you that the house I live in has been for several months past the jolliest place for cat music anybody ever knew of. Cats congregated here from all parts of the city; they nightly made it their headquarters. Under the floor and on top of the roof they gathered in huge squads and detachments, and of all infernal, unearthly squalling and diabolical choruses you ever heard—but description fails, I got several splendid shots at the devils with soda and beer bottles, making regular ""ten-strikes"" occasionally, but the only effect was to make them jump and tear round a little and shift to some other part of the house to have their sing out, so I finally resigned myself to the thing and let them alone; in fact I soon got so that I began to enjoy it and couldn't sleep well without a couple of dozen of their soothing voices in full blast. But here a couple of weeks ago, one of my neighbors put out a lot of strychnine meat and killed every confounded cat—never left one. I couldn't sleep for over a week, but I am all right again now; a man with a set of Scotch bagpipes has moved in next door.</p><p>Elko Coal.</p><p>At the Hale & Norcross hoisting works in this city, a day or two since, they received a lot of the coal recently discovered near Elko, and the experiment of burning it instead of wood is being tried. It costs about $30 per ton delivered here; and if it is ascertained to be cheaper fuel than wood to fire up under boilers with, it certainly will be substituted. There is plenty of it where this came from. It resembles English cannel coal somewhat, and burns with a fierce bright flame, being of a highly bituminous character.</p><p>Our Railroad.</p><p>The first of the iron for the railroad between here and Carson arrived at Reno a few days since, and the first loads of it were taken to Carson day before yesterday. The laying of the rails will commence at that end of the route and will be prosecuted just as fast as possible. The grading is nearly completed and the cars will be running inside of six weeks. The rails will not be laid at the rate of ten miles a day or anything like the fast rates in that respect achieved on the Central Pacific Railroad, for the reason that it is all curves—just the crookedest road you ever saw. The San Joaquin River is nothing to it.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>During the past week stocks have got demoralized, and experienced quite a tumble, closing with a still declining tendency. Some stocks stood firm enough—the Sierra Nevada, for instance, and the Hale & Norcross—but others, such as the Yellow Jacket, drooped without any just or apparent cause. In some instances, however, the fall was justifiable and even a further decline would not bring them much below their actual merits.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada is getting along finely, as usual, both mine and mill always working at a very regular, steady-going, bullion-producing rate. The first clean-up for the present month was made last Thursday, and was, if anything, a little better than the average. The crude bullion, however, being sent to San Francisco, as usual, the precise figures cannot be given for a day or two. The state of the mine remains about the same, except that the body of ore recently developed in the car-track tunnel improves both in quality and quantity, as drifted upon. The same may be said of that developed at the westerly end of the surface pit. There is plenty of ore in sight to keep up the regular monthly dividends for a long time to come.</p><p>The Ophir west drift is now in nearly 600 feet, and the rock at present encountered is of rather more favorable character. The ledge must be met with soon, if ever.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is 305 feet deep to-day, and work is progressing favorably, as usual. No more water is encountered than is hoisted out with the soft rock and clay.</p><p>Nothing encouraging is yet found in drifting at the seventh or 1,160-foot level of the Gould & Curry—only porphyry, with seams of clay and quartz, but no ore. The main shaft of the mine, sunk from D street, and known as the Bonner Shaft, is 1,185 feet from the surface; the second is 425 feet from the surface, and through it the old upper workings of the mine are worked, yielding at present thirty tons of ore per day, assaying over $50 to the ton. The fourth station, 825 feet from the surface, contains no ore, there being none of any consequence found below the second station. It is being blocked up tightly at present, in order to dam up the water which flows from it, thus saving considerable expense in the pumping line. A large Root's patent blower, driven by a little three-horse power donkey engine, has just been put in operation to supply fresh air from the surface, by means of tubes to the lowest level as well as the second stations. The deeper sinking of the Savage shaft for a new level100 feet below the present lower level, was commenced last Thursday. The repairs to the shaft which have impeded the working of the mine, and lessened the production for some months past, are nearly completed, and good hopes are reasonably indulged in of good ore being found in sinking deeper. A full suit of the best quality of English steel wire cables for all three working compartments of the shaft are just put on, and everything works well. The Savage may come out yet.</p><p>In the Hale & Norcross, water still impedes westward drifting at the fourth level. The ore developed in raising from the fifth or lower level, shows considerable improvement in quality; in fact, the mine is looking exceedingly well throughout. The repairs to the shaft being concluded, sinking for a new level was commenced last Tuesday. The fifth or lower level is 1,000 feet from the top of the new shaft, and the proposed new level will be 100 feet deeper, or 1,100 feet below the surface. This new level will undoubtedly develop a vast amount of good ore.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields about 175 tons of ore per day, and the excellent body of ore developed in the new tunnel section widens as it is developed northward. The hoisting works recently burned are being replaced by others of about the same size and capacity.</p><p>Drifting at the 1080-foot level of the Imperial-Empire is not yet commenced, as the repairs to the shaft are more extensive than anticipated. The usual quantity of ore is yielded by the old upper levels. On the Imperial there was levied last Thursday an assessment of $10 per share, aggregating $40,000, delinquent October 19th.</p><p>About 180 tons of ore per day is the yield of the Yellow Jacket south mine. The old north shaft will be cleared of water and mud down to the 700-foot level track floor about the last of the week. This is one of the best mines, if not the best, on the Comstock ledge at the present time, speaking in reference to both present and future prospects.</p><p>The Overman yields about 25 tons of $20 ore daily, with a good prospect for a future increase.</p><p>The annual meeting of the segregated Belcher Mining Company, for the election of officers, takes place October 5th, at San Francisco.</p><p>An assessment of $150 per share is levied on the American. This is a mine filled with low grade ore, at the south end of the Comstock, and is a purely speculative institution.</p><p>The lower tunnel of the Occidental is into the lead about 20 feet, and good ore is already found in little streaks. A better showing will be given very shortly when the main pay streak is cut into. The annual meeting of the Company will be held at the office of the company at Virginia, October 9, for the election of Trustees for the ensuing year.</p><p>The Lady Bryan looks better and better as far as recently made developments are concerned. At the special meeting of the Company held at Virginia last Tuesday, the proposition to increase the capital stock was adopted. Hereafter, the capital will be $2,700,000, divided into 18,000 shares, of $150 each—instead of the old capital of $1,800,000, divided into 6,000 shares, of$300 each.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Martinetti's are drawing rather slim houses. They close at the Opera House tonight and go to Carson and elsewhere, returning to play at the Opera House next Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. Their performances are rather tame for this latitude. Alf.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH27.jpg,sf-herald
SFH28,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD]</p><p>VIRGINIA (Nev.,) September 26.</p><p>Our Base-Ball.</p><p>Within the last few weeks or months quite a mania for base-ball has afflicted our young men of Virginia, and the natural consequence was the formation of a base-ball club. They have been assiduously practicing as often as possible and had got so proficient at the game that they fondly imagined themselves as little if any inferior to the famous Red Stockings. They felt a little diffident about going down and beating the California Nine, or even of inviting the Red Stockings over here to be vanquished, so in order to branch out easy they thought best to make a descent upon Carson first and wipe out the Silver Base-Ball Club down there. So they sent a challenge which was accepted, and yesterday they chartered a fine four horse conveyance and away they went in gallant style. They were met at Warm Springs by the hospitable committee and treated to a cocktail and a good breakfast, and when the play came on in the afternoon in the presence of hundreds of ladies and gentlemen, they were beaten handsomely; only scoring 31 to the Carson boys' 82. They skulked out of town the best way they could without attracting too much observation, and came home as quiet as sucking lambs. They will not challenge the Red Stockings, but judging from what the telegraph tells us about the result of the base-ball match yesterday in San Francisco, they would just about be a match for your badly beaten boys.</p><p>Sutro's Tunnel.</p><p>Sutro has broken ground, or about to do so, in actual commencement of his great tunnel from Carson River to the Comstock ledge. Sutro made a big talk at Piper's Opera House last Monday evening and had it printed, therefore no doubt you have read it already and therefore know all about it. Sutro did far better than I had thought him capable of doing, and I could not help thinking as I listened, ""Verily, Sutro, thou reasonest well."" Sutro made a most able effort, and the way he did pitch into the California Bank was jolly to contemplate. Literally, ""The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold;"" he gave them particular fits.  To the initiated, however, it was simply a matter of spite toward the very capital which would once have assisted him and carried him through in triumph, had he availed himself of its assistance promptly and rightly, but he was too dilatory and let the golden opportunity slip past, no more to return. I have done the best I know how, at all times and on all occasions, to aid and abet Sutro's great project, as absolutely essential to the future working of the Comstock ledge, and having done so, without fee or reward of any kind, I am perfectly at liberty to state my opinion regarding it That tunnel, or something similar to it, will eventually be run, but by more ability and capital than Sutro can command or influence at the present time. Should I be wrong in this opinion, however, and he should finally succeed, I shall rejoice in his success, for he will well deserve it.</p><p>Lady Bryan Mill.</p><p>The new mill of the Lady Bryan Company is just completed, and started into operation at 10 o'clock A. M. to-day. It consists of two batteries of five 750 pound stamps each, four of McCone's mammoth pans, working 5,000 pounds at a charge, and two huge settlers, ten feet in diameter by three feet deep, together with all the requisite pulp tanks and other fixtures and appurtenances usually to be found in a mill of that capacity. The machinery, propelled by a horizontal engine with 12 inch cylinder and 35 inch stroke, rated at 34 horsepower, but which is easily run up to over 60 horsepower if required. One of the largest sized Blake's rock breakers reduces the ore to about the size of walnuts and less, and the batteries are self feeding. The working capacity of the mill is about 30 tons a day. It is well housed in; everything is of the most substantial order, and taken altogether, I look upon it as the best mill in the State. It is situated close by the mine, so that the ore cars are run directly to the batteries, and the requisite water for the use of the mill is supplied form the mine itself. In the ravine below the mill there is a splendid chance for blanket sluices, and other arrangements for saving tailings, and it is estimated that the ore from the mine will be milled by this new mill for less than $5 per ton. There is no expense for hauling, and the ore is extracted from the mine for $3 a ton. Besides what is crushed by the new mill, sufficient ore is extracted to supply the Empire State mill, about a mile distant, of the capacity of 30 stamps.</p><p>Lady Bryan Mine.</p><p>This valuable mine is situated in a ravine near Six-Mile Canon, some three miles from this city and consists of an immense ledge of silver ore nearly 300 feet wide, running north and south, and dipping east at an angle of about 45 degrees. It has been worked with varied success for several years, but it is only within the past few months that the real regular pay streak has been found and fully developed. This is about twelve feet wide and extends from the surface down as far as worked. Some of the ore is very rich in green chloride as well as black sulphurets of silver, and also fine gold, but the general average may be set down at from $30 to $40 per ton. The present principal workings are from the surface down to the 80-foot level, although the shaft is 90 feet deeper below that, or 170 feet deep, and the pay streak is found to extend to the bottom. It is proposed to commence in about a week to sink the shaft 200 feet deeper. The yield is about 60 tons per day at present, employing 30 miners, exclusive of carmen, engineers, and other employees. There is no water to contend with in the present workings. The main drift at the 80-foot level is extended south about 75 feet from the shaft, showing still better ore as it proceeds, and 80 feet north, but here the ledge appears broken; a winze, however, sunk there 30 feet in depth develops excellent pay ore, rich in free gold. With the present showing of good ore, mining and milling facilities, there is no reason in the world why the Lady Bryan should not be paying regular dividends soon.</p><p>Other Mines.</p><p>The Belcher is yielding some 20 tons of excellent ore per day, principally from the 335 foot lead, averaging from $30 to $160 per ton, with an accumulation of 500 tons on the dump. The Kelsey Mill, however, which commenced running on it day before yesterday, will soon reduce that pile.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket yields 160 tons of ore per day from the 800 and 900-foot levels of the south mine. The north shaft is at last cleared of its long accumulation of mud and water, and the truck floor of the 700-foot level was reached last Tuesday. That level is being cleaned out, and the shaft prepared for hoisting ore, which will be commenced in about three or four weeks; meanwhile, a wine or raise is nearly completed from the 800 up to the 700-foot level, through which ore will be hoisted, and which will add immensely to the ventilation of the entire mine.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields 180 tons per day, principally form the Blue Wing section. The New Tunnel section shows an increase of still better ore. The latest average assays of the mine are over $45 per ton.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross yields 145 tons per day. The various breasts at the lower levels give an excellent showing, and the upper levels also yield well. The repairs to the shaft are completed, and the sinking deeper for the 1,100-foot level progresses satisfactorily.</p><p>The lower level of the Gould & Curry shows nothing encouraging as yet. The old upper workings yield about as much.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is 335 feet deep to-day, and the hard blasting rock is encountered, which rather impedes progress.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada never looked better, or in fact, as well. An enormous amount of excellent pay ore is developed in both the car track tunnel and at the surface workings, and the mill is steadily grinding away on the second run of the month, which is expected to turn out extra good. Everything in and about the mine or mill is under the best and most efficient arrangement.</p><p>The Occidental lower tunnel has cut into the ledge another some 30 or 40 feet, but the pay streak is not yet reached, although the indications at present are excellent, and good assays are obtained. Owing to the sharp angle at which the tunnel strikes the ledge, development is necessarily slow, and they may have to run 100 feet further in length before getting into the pay streak.</p><p>The fire is still thought to be burning in the Gold Hill mines, although it is blockaded in tightly, but considerable of that same gas still leaks out, indicating fire. It is evidently working upward, as of late miners have been able to get into the 700-foot level of the Crown Point mine to a considerable extent. No ore continues to be yielded by the Crown Point, neither is there anything encouraging yet developed at the lowest levels, where the most recent explorations in the ledge for are have been made.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>Rev. S. B. Bell delivered a lecture on ""Man, and Woman, too,"" at Piper's Opera House, to an audience of 33 in the dress circle, last Tuesday evening. The chief merit of his lecture was its originality.

SFH29,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD]</p><p>VIRGINIA CITY, October 8, 1869.</p><p>After the Chinese.</p><p>Last Wednesday afternoon, a procession of men, numbering 350, composed of members of the Miners' Unions of Virginia and Gold Hill, and outsiders of the working-class marshaled by the respective Presidents of the two Unions and headed by a drum and fife, marched down through Gold Hill and to where the Virginia and Truckee Railroad is being graded, just below Crown Point Ravine, at the lower end of town, with the avowed purpose of driving off the Chinese employed as graders along the line of the road. They had it all their own way, the Chinese gathering up their traps and leaving in a hurry as soon as the formidable army came in sight. They took to the sage-brush, and scattered over the hills in all directions, at a pretty lively rate.</p><p>The workmen marched down as far as the lower end of American Flat, effecting their object in the most complete manner, and telling the bosses of each gang that if they put Chinamen to work again they would get into trouble. The Sheriff was fully apprised of what was going to be done, and he and his deputies went along with the crowd, in order to interfere, perhaps, in case of any row. He read a proclamation commanding them to disperse, and his deputy read the riot act. This, the Sheriff says, is all he could nor can do in the matter; therefore he must be far more powerless than the Sheriff at White Pine. This action on the part of the workingmen effectually put a check on the construction of the railroad at present, for next day the company knocked off all the white laborers—bosses, cartmen and all. And so the matter stands. The great question asked now among everybody is, ""What next?"" Will the Governor declare Storey County in a state of insurrection, and send a big lot of soldiers to protect the railroad company in their rights and arrest the ringleaders in this movement, or will the railroad company try and get even in some other way? My own personal record shows me always to have been a strong friend of the Miners' Union and of workingmen generally; but when they turn aggressors, trample on the rights of other people, set the laws at defiance and deliberately quarrel with their own bread and butter, I must differ with them. The railroad company have had Chinese grading on the road ever since the first commencement, and in two weeks more the whole of the grading would have been finished and the Chinese discharged; therefore I look upon it as a very bad break on the part of the boys, waiting until this late date, or of even interfering at all with an inoffensive lot of laborers who were not interfering at all with them. By the same right of might, and with the same propriety, they might drive out all the Chinese workmen, cooks and flunkies in the country—yes, even the Chinese wood-packers, upon whom they will have to depend for wood this winter. The miners say the Chinese shall not work in these mines; that is all well enough, but surely in building the Pacific Railroad, the Carson Railroad or any other railroad, these Chinese as graders, like horses, mules or oxen, can be used cheaply and to most excellent advantage. In the above argument I don't wish anybody to infer that I want to marry a Chinaman—not much. The Chinese don't take either the Herald, the Gold Hill News or the Enterprise—they don't pay for my bread and butter.</p><p>The Big Frogs of Walker Lake.</p><p>My prospecting friend from Walker Lake, who told me of that shower of beef-bones, liver, etc., I wrote you about in one of my recent letters, has been telling me a large-sized frog story, which, I think, will do to print for the consideration of the scientific and those versed in natural history. He says there is a species of mammoth frog around the borders of that wonderful lake, about the size of small wheelbarrow. They are not very plenty, owing to their being such excellent eating, and the Indians killing them for food. They are a sort of dirty brown, or the color of a granite boulder, and can run as fast as a bear, taking to the sage-brush with great facility in case they are pursued and cut off from retreating into the lake. Their skins are covered with big, hard scales like a perch, impenetrable to common shot, and yielding only to a rifle ball, or a slug from a six-shooter. Dogs will not touch them more than once, owing to their disgusting outside slime, and, in fact, if they can only get hold of a dog they will kill him sure, simply by hugging him with both legs and arms, so to speak, and rolling with him into the lake, where the frog is at home under water for ten minutes at a time, and the dog is not. They feed principally on a species of fresh water clam, which abounds along the shore, and also on an occasionally unwary fish. In the summer, too, it is a favorite sport with them to burrow in the dry sand and go to sleep, with their mouth wide open, like a water bucket, occasionally waking up to slap their jaws together and swallow about a peck of flies. They change their skins once a year, and the way this is done is very interesting and ingenious. The new skin, forming inside, causes the old one to become loose, wrinkled and puffy, and when the proper period arrives, the frog just goes up to a big rock and rubs his nose, head and shoulder against it, until the skin breaks loose and he can roll it back on his neck; then he climbs into the nearest big sage brush or scrub cedar, hitches his hind feet into convenient forks of the branches, and jumps off, literally jumping out of his skin His greatest ambition on such occasions is to jump directly into the water, and if he succeeds he signifies his satisfaction by croaking chuckles and all sorts of sportive gyrations. And there the skin hangs by the hind legs on the bushes until discovered by some fortunate squaw, who eagerly appropriates it as a ready made garment for her papoose—a very convenient and stylish dress, that will last for years. All the little Indians about Walker Lake are dressed in frog skins.</p><p>Stocks</p><p>Long faces for the last two or three weeks, have been indicative of a disgustingly low state of mining stocks—lower than ever before. Within the past two or three days, however, things have looked a little better, a general rise of stocks being experienced, based, I am happy to state, on better prospects in some of the leading mines.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>In the Sierra Nevada mine a new and important development of ore was recently made in a winze below the car track tunnel, and about 160 feet from the surface. The vein is of a white gold-bearing ore, and as it is wider than the winze, its width can only be ascertained by a cross cut. It is being put through the mill, and car samples average over forty dollars assay, to the ton. The body of ore recently developed at the westerly end of the surface workings is more extensive than at first supposed, and will last for many months. Indeed the prospects of this excellent mine are better at present than for some time past. The second clean up of the mill for September, made on the 30th, yielded much better than the first. The usual monthly dividend of fifty cents per share, or $2.50 per foot, will be declared on or about the 6th instant. It is noticeable that, in all the late depression in stocks, the Sierra Nevada has stood firm, and subject to but little fluctuation.</p><p>Some few seams of clay, quartz and other encouraging indications have lately been struck in the Ophir tunnel, which is now 626 feet from the shaft, is now in 140 feet, and I think is the likeliest of the two to strike ore.</p><p>The new shaft of the Virginia Consolidated is 346 feet deep, and the hard streak recently struck is passed through and softer rock found.</p><p>Nothing new developed in the drifts at the lower level of the Gould & Curry. The old upper working yield forty tons of $45 ore per day.</p><p>In the Savage a deposit of ore assaying as high as $70, and four or five feet in width, has been developed in the east drift at the seventh station; and in a winze south of the shaft, between the sixth and seventh stations a very good body of ore has also been found. The effect is seen in the rise of the stock. The men were shut down in the mine Friday morning, but let out again last evening.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross yields about 175 tons of ore per day, and is looking very well indeed. The shaft is sunk to the depth of 1,100 feet, and is to be continued 100 feet more.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi looks well, as usual, with some improvement in the ore of the New Tunnel section. The new hoisting works are in an advanced state towards completion.</p><p>The east drift at the lower level of the bullion is abandoned, and drifting north and south in the ledge is now being done with indifferent prospects.</p><p>Nothing new developed in the Yellow Jacket; all about the same as when I last wrote. The 700-foot level of the north mine will be cleaned out and put in good working condition this week.</p><p>The Overman Stock has taken quite a jump the last day or two, based on improvements in the ore at the 500-foot level.</p><p>The Occidental lower tunnel is in soft picking ledge matter, but not yet in the regular pay streak. The upper portion of the mine yields as usual. On the 9th instant the annual meeting of the stockholders will be held in this city for the choice of officers for the ensuing year.</p><p>Nothing new to report relative to the Lady Bryan. The new mill works to a charm, and is crushing at the rate of 30 pounds a day. The proprietors of this mine, apparently, have things to suit them at present.</p><p>Fire.</p><p>The storehouse for patterns, at McCone's Nevada Foundry, Silver City, was destroyed by fire night before last, together with its valuable contents, consisting of patterns of the machinery of most of the mills of this State. The loss is estimated at $40,000, covered by $10,000 insurance in the Pacific Insurance Company. The fire was the work of an incendiary, and came near also destroying the residence of Mr. McCone, near by, which was only saved by the most strenuous exertions.</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Fakir of Vishnu finished a most successful engagement last evening at Piper's Opera House. He played the whole week to full houses every evening, and a crowded matinee Saturday afternoon. He is a first-class magician and legerdemainist., but the greatest attraction is his distribution of gifts, each evening giving away from $75 to $150 worth of all sorts of useful and desirable articles in the way of groceries, furniture, articles of dress, tin ware, livestock, poultry, can fruit, etc., all to lucky holders of prize tickets. He is bound to do well in this country.   ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH29.jpg,sf-herald
SFH30,"<p>LETTER FROM VIRGINIA CITY.</p><p>[SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HERALD.]</p><p>George Francis Train.</p><p>He has been here, and he has gone away again. Like a brilliant comet with a fiery tail he arose on our horizon, culminated in true rocket style, and went down similarly. He came in on the ""buckboard"" from Reno—23 miles—in an hour and 31 minutes, and retained vitality enough to lecture the same evening. He gave four lectures, commencing with a $217 house, culminating the second night with a $350 house, and ending the fourth night with a $130 house. As he freely stated to his audience, he had half the gross receipts of the house for the four what he was talking to them; and his half for the four nights amounted to just $374.75. George is a very sensational man, and has a very large brain, very unevenly balanced. He has a heap of good sense, though, and I liked very much to hear him talk. No mountebank lecturer ever did half so well in that line. He knows his business well, and plays his character for all it is worth. Like Emperor Norton, or Uncle Neddy Coombs when made up for Washington, George Francis has a peculiar individuality; there is but one George Francis Train in the world. A greater gaspipe, humbug, charlatan, blatant demagogue, and self-righteous Pharisee never existed in the world; he is unadulterated sounding brass and ineffable cheek personified. But, then, you San Francisco folks know all about him.</p><p>As soon as he arrived, he issued his manifestos, in the shape of handbills, scattered broadcast, telling what he was going to do, threatening especially to crucify and totally annihilate the Bank of California, wipe out their little private railroad between here and Carson, and do many other terrible things. Well, he did nothing of the kind. The Bank still exists, and the railroad progresses toward completion, just as though George Francis Train never existed. He in fact said nor did anything that anybody can remember or feel; therefore all he said or did amounted to just his $374.75, which he got for it. He is simply a first-class star actor of the truly original and entertaining character of George Francis Train. The Britishers did not appreciate him as we do, or instead of putting him in prison as a dangerous political agitator, they would simply have shut him up in a lunatic asylum for a while. A fair and impartial study of the man, however, compels me to acknowledge him to be more of a knave than a fool. He is a shrewd, calculating Yankee, adopting the eccentricity style as the most profitable, and he makes it pay. No, the man who calls George a d—d fool, can fight me; I stand up for him every time.</p><p>The Smartest of Them All.</p><p>The smartest man in the State of Nevada is William Sharon, Esq., in his personified embodiment as Agent of the Bank of California. He better could possibly be selected. He knows his business, and thoroughly attends to it. He earnestly desires all true influence, whether of stationary or floating character, to be exercised for the benefit of the institution which he so faithfully represents. Therefore, whenever a man comes here of prominence in the nation, or whose influence for good or evil, he thinks is worth propitiating, Sharon goes after him, heading off everybody else. Thus he got the first location in the Ways and Means Committee, Colfax, and the other Government notables, who have been here recently. He took complete possession of them, treated them, made them sleep with him, showed them all which it was proper for them to know—who sustained the country, who owned it, what it would be without the Bank of California, how to take snuff out of the heel of an old boot, how to go into the house when it rains, and many other awful points of information. They left properly impressed. The very softest snap of them all was George Francis Train.</p><p>The very evening of his arrival, when he dashed through C street on the buckboard, with the pony of the rival express just ahead, and waved his hat and bowed so acknowledgingly to the crowds lining the sidewalks, under the fond delusion that it was a grand popular ovation in honor of his arrival, instead of being the usual crowd of spectators gathering every evening to see the racing expresses come in. That very evening, before he had got the dust of the road shaken off, Sharon called on him at the International in a sort of incidental way, and made his acquaintance. He located him; he secured him, and before George was aware of it, Sharon had genteelly polished off all the rough corners from the terrible missiles he had prepared to launch forth against the Band of California. At every one of his lectures, George Francis announced what slaughtering, damaging crushers he was going to thunder down upon the Bank; and all its enemies were there with their long ears expectantly open; but, ah ! the spell of the enchanter was upon him, and if George's terrible stinger was sharp and effective, nobody could see the ;point as far as hurting the Bank was concerned. He ate oysters with Sharon, drank soda with him, rode about with him, and ran all night with him at the high-toned ball Sharon got up for his special delectation at this private residence. The dazzled George felt good, and the more Sharon ticked his big bump of self-conceit, the better he felt.</p><p>The next night was to be his last lecture, so he gave Sharon and all his friends free passes to come in ""dead head"" to the show. The result was that fifteen of the Bank of California passed in free, greatly to the disgust of Piper, who thought he ought to have $6.50 out of them as his share, honestly believing in the good old adage, that ""those who dance should pay the Piper."" Wiegand, too, our popular Gold Hill assayer, who had prepared a beautiful little $40 silver brick, covered with an appropriate inscription, and presented it to the marvelous George, was there also, and didn't ring in ""dead head"" either, although he also had a pass, for his peculiar conscience wouldn't allow it; so he had the jolly pleasure of sitting there in the dress circle and having George Francis acknowledge the receipt of that desirable bullion brick from a ""Mr. Wingard.""</p><p>Well, George had announced in his bill that this evening he was going to give his ""parting kick at the Bank of California;"" but people had begun to know him a little, so he had a slim audience. He didn't kick the Bank at all—not much—but, on the contrary, stood up for it and the Carson Railroad and Sharon, like a major. It was a ""great cry and little wool."" I am George's friend, and will do him the justice to say that his lectures were exceedingly entertaining, and everybody who attended got their full money's worth in one shape or other. He left yesterday noon for Salt Lake, where, if he talks about woman's rights as he did here, Brigham will cave his head in for him.</p><p>Mining Items.</p><p>George Francis Train says our mines are worked out, and that a financial crash will in consequence overwhelm us in about six weeks or less, but we all bet leave to differ from his inexperienced sapiency in that matter. All along the Comstock the mines are looking more promising than for months past, and before next spring a largely increased bullion yield will prove what I say to be true. Bullion tells better stories than George Francis Train. Stocks are low now, but that makes no difference; they will be high enough next spring.</p><p>The Yellow Jacket is turning out the usual amount of ore from the south mine. The north shaft will be cleaned out in about three weeks sufficiently to allow of working in the  700-foot level once more, and just as soon as a winze can be sunk from it to the 800-foot level a huge body of rich ore will be opened, and the present bullion yield of that famous mine more than doubled.</p><p>The Hale & Norcross yield is increased to 100 tons per day, the repairs being completed, so that ore is once more being hoisted from the lowest level. The 300 and the 175-foot levels also yield well, and a winze being sunk below the fourth station level is in a streak of $60 ore three or four feet wide.</p><p>The Chollar-Potosi yields about 225 tons of $50 ore per day, mostly from the old Blue Wing stopes. The Grass Valley and New Tunnel sections are also showing good ore improvement both in quantity and quality.</p><p>The Kentuck gives an increased yield of excellent ore, but nothing good is yet developed in the Crown Point.</p><p>The Overman shows a gratifying increase of production, yielding now at the rate of nearly fifty tons of $25 ore per day. This is high grade ore for that mine, as it contains immense bodies of the low grade article which will be brought into paying requisition at no distant day.</p><p>The Occidental pays very well and after its regular established style. The lower tunnel is nearly into the ledge and from present indications will tap it within a week or so, as the face shows more quartz, and occasionally a little ore. This tunnel will strike the ledge 400 feet deeper than the present lowest workings; therefore great expectations are justly indulged in as to what it will develop.</p><p>The Sierra Nevada is getting along finely, as usual, both mine and mill, and a run of excellent ore is now being made which will doubtless yield better than usual. The second clean-up for the month will be made to-morrow or next day..</p><p>Theatrical.</p><p>The Murphy and Mack Minstrels will return from Salt Lake and reappear at Piper's Opera House on the 1st and 2d of next month, and the Martinotti's will be here on the 6th. They will draw crowded houses. ALF.</p>",public://sf-herald/SFH30.jpg,sf-herald

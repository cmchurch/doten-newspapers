DU01,"<p>DANCING AND POLITICS IN COMO.</p><p>COMO, Palmyra District, N.T.   }</p><p>August 18, 1863    }</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:—Yesterday was a jolly day for our thriving young city, and our streets were paraded by an extra supply of crinoline. The morning coaches brought us from Dayton a delegation of some twenty of the fair sex, who were out on a pleasure excursion to this place, and bent on having a good time generally. Of course their advent here was hailed with joy by all the masculines, for—</p><p>""Lives there a man with soul so dead,</p><p>Who never to himself hath said,""</p><p>Naught can the human heart beguile</p><p>Like the sunshine of sweet woman's smile.</p><p>At the residence of S. B. Hunt, Esq., they were received by his estimable lady and the other ladies of the District, and treated to a substantial collation, after partaking of which, and resting from the fatigues of their journey, they and their hostesses all repaired to Scammel’s new hall, which was gaily decorated for the occasion with evergreen wreaths and branches of pine, which, on the wall at the farther end of the building, was formed into the glorious word ""Union.""</p><p>Now, to say that the men of Como didn’t ""go in"" for the ""Union,"" and with heart and soul, in the ""gay and festive scene,"" would be a slander on the gallantry of the sex. Indeed, they did ""sail in,"" and for two or three hours the happy assemblage tripped it on the ""light fantastic toe"" to their hearts' content. The jovial fiddler and the melancholy banjo player did miracles of music, and quadrille, waltz, schottische and mazourka followed each other in rapid succession. About five P.M. our fair guests left us, well pleased with their visit, and the dashing roadsters of Robert’s line whiled them off merrily on their road home to Dayton.</p><p>Whether it was the influence of this delegation of pretty women here which caused it or not we will not say, but one thing is certain, there were two Union primary meetings held in the evening, one of which—the true-blue, unmistakable Union—nominated G. W. Swain for Justice of the Peace, J. Craig for Constable, and S. S. Chinn for Mining Recorder for this District. The other meeting nominated T. W. Penny for Justice, J. White for Constable, and S. Magee for Recorder.          A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU01.jpg,daily-union
DU02,"<p>UNION MEETING AT COMO.</p><p>COMO (Palmyra District) Aug. 23, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: —Last evening we had a political meeting, which was quite a spirited affair for Como, or any other place. The unconditional Union forces were assembled—ladies and all—to hear the grand principles of true, loyal Democracy expounded, and to see the various Union candidates ""trotted out"" before them.</p><p>F. H. Kennedy, of Dayton, candidate for the Constitutional Convention, first took the stand, and addressed the meeting in a speech of some length; he explained to us what a ""copperhead"" is, ripped up the platform of the so-called ""Peace Democracy,"" and pitched into that delectable party with a perfect looseness. He quoted the death-bed remarks of the lamented Stephen A. Douglas, shouldered the whole blame of the present bloody war upon the imbecile old bachelor, James Buchanan, held up each plank of the true, loyal, unconditional Union platform to our view, and showed us the soundness of the material of which it is composed; on it he was willing to stand or fall. His remarks were well received.</p><p>Mr. Gates, of Dayton, candidate for District Attorney, followed with a capital good speech, remarkable for its energetic clearness and soundness of sentiment. His felicitous remarks and happy illustrations were much applauded, and what few copperheads were within reach, writhed beneath his stinging lash. W. H. Virden, of this town, candidate for the Constitutional Convention, then made a short speech, defining his position and giving us his sentiments, which were of the perfectly sound order. R. E. Trask, of Dayton, candidate for the Assembly, made a right loyal, common-sense speech, endorsing the Administration and all its acts, which was received with much applause. G. A. Bier, of this town, candidate for Road Supervisor, being now loudly called for, mounted the stand, and gave us a speech in his own peculiar style, explaining how he will mend our ways, in case he is elected; and how he is ""Union"" from his heels to the top of his head. (Six feet two inches.) His spirited remarks were happily received, and wound up the meeting with a grand flourish.    A. D. </p>",public://daily-union/DU02.jpg,daily-union
DU03,"<p>UNION MEETING AT COMO.</p><p>COMO, Sept. 1st, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:—Last evening the quiet of our little city was broken by the sound of a hand-bell of the Como House traveling up and down street, and calling a meeting at Sacramento Hall. Of course your correspondent joined in the rush, and managed to squeeze in without any difficulty, for there was plenty of room. Mounted on the rostrum, and pouring forth his eloquence, was J. Blackford of Dayton, candidate for the assembly, who came up here this evening to demolish the Union party and its nominees, and to stop everybody from voting for any one but himself for the Assembly.</p><p>His audience was composed of some of our good old staunch Copperheads, a few bogus Union men and some few of the true loyal stripe, about equal quantities of each—a jolly mixture. Blackford told all about what we have so often read and heard before—the origin and progress of slavery in America—and followed it down to the present time. He pitched into the rabid Abolitionists of the North, and the Secessionists of the South; and said that Crittenden would have saved the Union if his ""compromise"" had been adopted. But no; there must be fighting done, blood shed, the whole nation must be plunged into a bloody war, and ""farms for every one of ye, away down there"" in the South, was the inducement held out to Union soldiers to fight for. He denounced the South for seceding, and trying to break up the Union, and was not in favor of fighting her and punishing her until ""she shall once more acknowledge the supremacy of the Government."" Lincoln was naturally a good man, but his principles had become depraved by the set of evil counselors he had about him. R. E. Trask, his (Blackford's) opponent for the Assembly was naturally a good man in his way, but the mob spirit was rife within him. Trask was decidedly in favor of suppressing treasonable newspapers, by force, if necessary, instead of leaving it for others to do; therefore, Trask and ""them other fellers"" that were nominated by the Union Convention at Dayton, wouldn’t do to vote for. He told Dad Vestal’s story, about the ""sheep,"" illustrating that ""them other fellers"" that were nominated with Trask, were in ""dam bad company."" He represented to us the danger there was, that the Abolition party might eventually get the power, and crush us all under foot without benefit of the clergy, and then he told us the stale, but funny old story about the ""feller and the girl"" and her ""agility."" The speaker then drew his remarks to a close, having effectually squelched the Union party, league and all. But he must be electioneering for Trask and ""them other fellers,"" for he has secured their election, as far as Como is concerned, even allowing that it was not safe enough before. S. R. Belden, Esq., President of the meeting, being now loudly called upon, got up and said it was no use for him to try to speak after their listening to the eloquence of the preceding orator.  He was ""something like a scrub mustang, brought out to trot against a fine stallion"" —""couldn’t do it."" T. W. Penny, Esq., Vice President, excused himself on the grounds that he was no orator, but an excellent worker. McCumber, candidate for Road Supervisor, couldn’t be induced to speak at all, so the meeting had to adjourn.    A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU03.jpg,daily-union
DU04,"<p>COMO CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, Sept 15th, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: The clouds of war have now blown over; the forces have retired from the field, and a calm succeeds the political tempest. Secesh and Copperheads were very few in your neighborhood compared with what they were here, therefore you were all right. They were very plenty here, and on election day ran us pretty sharp, as you saw by the returns, but it was a ""draw game"" between us, we electing some of their candidates and they electing some of theirs. The thing will never happen again, however; for, although this district has been heretofore noted for its secesh proclivities, yet there are too many Union men coming in now. Copperheads will have to drop back into their coils, or wriggle off into the sage brush, out of the way. They are ""played out."" They did not see it, though, before the election, but knowing their strength here they confidently put forth their votive powers in a highly spirited manner, evidently under the fond delusion that ""as goes Como so goes the world."" Indeed, so confident were they that secesh and Copperhead would carry the entire Territory that in the evening, while the votes were being counted, they talked freely and officially of their future plans. In fact, one jubilant individual, as soon as he ascertained that he was some dozen votes or so ahead of his opponent, took all the boys down to the Como House and stood treat to several rounds of Barrett's best, perfectly reckless as to the expense, privately informing several as to how he was going to have his plans carried out in regard to public improvements, when he should have entered upon the duties of his office. He spoke forgivingly of his opponent—admitted that he was ""a d---d good feller,"" but not ""good enough for the office—the people knew that, therefore wouldn't vote for him; to be sure he might get a few votes in Silver City and a few in Dayton, but h—ll, that warn't nothing; couldn't possibly be elected; no show; let's have another drink."" One aspirant for legislative honors also felt quite jolly except that he was ""all right"" as far as his own precinct was concerned, and therefore surely the other precincts wouldn't ""throw off"" on him; no danger of that; couldn't be done; got too many friends."" But, alas! For the doomed. The arrival of the stage next day brought the news that treason and Copperheadism were made to bow, everywhere, low in the dust before the triumphant march of the true loyal sons of the Republic of the Starry Banner. What an amusing contrast. Merrily twinkled the eyes of the ""elect."" Pendant hung the lower jaws of the disappointed. Long faces wore the passengers for ""Salt River,"" as they silently stepped on board the boat. Blistered hands have they now, as they pull at the oars, toiling up that stream, where many an illustrious passenger has preceded them, and where many more must go. Farewell! Don't come back until having eaten prodigally of the husks of repentance, ye may resolve to turn from the error of your ways, and crawling no longer on your political bellies as copperheads, arise and take a place in ranks of the faithful; those who have no ""North"" and no ""South,"" but go in for the best interests of the whole country, the Government, and the Union, ""right or wrong."" But never fear; sensible men will think; and their eyes will become opened to the light. Copperheadism has received a rebuke that it will remember; and as far as Como, politically, is concerned, you will never hear of anything else than a Union majority in all public elections, from now henceforward.</p><p>The one great reason why Secesh and Copperheads have been so numerous in this District heretofore, is because of the absence of female society; it being a stereotyped fact that the ladies are all for the Union—""to a man."" But within the past few weeks many ladies have found their way hither. About all of them, however, are married, there being only about one marriageable Miss in the district. She is for the ""Union,"" and is a ""belle"" without a rival.</p><p>The superintendent of the mill says it will be completed and ready to start in six weeks, but although we have only one quartz mill here as yet, we can boast of nine whisky mills, all in full blast with some half a dozen others in process of erection. When they all get to running, we shall be able to crush something, if it be nothing more than men's souls.</p><p>Daniel's new hotel opened a few days ago, and he is doing a thriving business. Mons. Belliard has also opened a French restaurant and boarding house. Mr. Cross is building a fine, large first class hotel, which when completed, will, probably, be the ""crack hotel"" of the place. Of the mines I need not speak. They show for themselves, and will yet astonish outsiders with their richness. The Shiloh, Monte Cristo, Minerva, Orizaba and Independence, are a few only among the ""coming"" Comstocks of this district, as we will show you in a few weeks when the mill starts. The Shiloh has always assayed ""big,"" and if it pays under the stamps only one tenth part as well as it assays, it will be a very rich institution. A new claim now about being incorporated, the Dacotah, also turns out rick that cannot fail to prove very rich. A.D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU04.jpg,daily-union
DU05,"<p>COMO CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, September 29, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: Still boldly striding onward in the march of improvement, Como maintains her place in the front rank, and notwithstanding the great and increasing rush towards the barren regions of Reese River, whose thin, rich ledges, in the far distance, glow with the brightness of enchantment, our promising district receives a fair share of attention from the emigrating crowd, and every day brings us fresh accessions to our lively community. The greatest drawback we have to contend with, in the way of building up our town, is the scarcity of lumber, which we cannot get near as fast as it is required. We can have no churches yet awhile, as all the lumber that can be had is used for making whisky mills and hotels. An extensive brewery is now being erected, so that in a short time we shall be supplied with an A No. 1 article of ""lager,"" better than ever before drank in this part of the Territory, if we may believe what ""Joe"" tells us, and we think we may for Joe is the same ""Joe"" who used to brew lager for the inhabitants of Columbia, California. However, we shall try Joe's lager, when he gets some brewed, and report.</p><p>Daniels keeps a good hotel in our town, and the traveling public will all find such to be the fact; his grub and liquor, and other accommodations being found unexceptionable, and bills as reasonable as could be wished. His boarders are all in fine order, and say Daniel ""can keep a hotel."" We have also a Lyceum here which meets once a week, on which occasion the ""men of Como"" meet in high conclave, and after solemn and soul-stirring debates, in which the eloquence of Webster, Choate, Demosthenes, or ""and other man,"" are completely surpassed, the great and all-important question, connected with the public welfare are all finally and satisfactorily settled by these giant minds.</p><p>By the time of the next Presidential election the fame of the Como Lyceum will have become so widely spread that it will attract the attention of Old Abe, and he will probably select his next Cabinet from the members of our Lyceum.</p><p>Professor Pinkhan, from California, has been delivering a series of lectures here, during the past week, on the subject of Phrenology, in the course of which he examined the heads of the members of the Lyceum, and found their bumps to be of a splendid quality and hardly to be improved upon.</p><p>Gideon McCumber has just opened a fine, large billiard saloon called the Como Exchange. Just before moving into it he gave the use of it to the public for the purpose of having a grand ball. The public, of course, improved such a good opportunity and the consequence was that the ball of the season was gotten up and came off in gay style, and was highly enjoyed by all who participated. The very charming music of the Como Cotillion Band enlivened the light fantastic toe, lovely forms and happy faces whirled merrily through the mazes of quadrille, schottische, waltz and mazourka, and among the bright galaxy of female beauty which graced the occasion, the witching eyes of the belle of the district beamed the enchantment of her smile upon the captive swains, who ""felt her magic power."" The supper, at midnight, was given by Daniels, at his hotel, just across the street. The festive crowd seated themselves to a supper, the like of which was never before known in this part of the Territory, and which it takes Daniels to get up. All the luxuries and delicacies that could be procured were placed before his delighted guests, prepared by that prince of good cooks, ""John, the barber,"" who, although a barber, is no barbarian, and, unlike John the Baptist, believes in something to eat besides ""locusts and wild honey."" Dancing was soon resumed, and the merry company, reinvigorated by the capital upper they had just partaken of, entered with renewed zest into the enjoyment of the ""gay and festive scene.""</p><p>""Music arose with its voluptuous swell;</p><p>Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spoke again,</p><p>And all went merry as a marriage bell.""</p><p>The approach of day ""told the hour for retiring,"" and each departing guest left the scene saying within themselves:</p><p>When there next doth be a ball</p><p>""May I be there to see.""</p><p>Well, we do manage to have some merry little times here in Como. The ladies are all lively, good looking and intelligent; and in fact, in the estimation of the men of Como, they are the finest lot of women in the Territory, and considerably above mediocrity. But then, any one coming here and viewing the pine clad hills, fine scenery, and rich mines of Palmyra district, must naturally become convinced that this is the place to live in and get rich. The pioneer mill will shortly get into operation, and rich results are confidently looked for. Other mills are also being contracted for, and will soon be on their way here. That they will all pay well there is no moral chance for a doubt, for the ledges assay rich, many of them high up in the hundreds, as, for instance, the Montezuma, a new claim just being incorporated, which assays one thousand dollars to the ton in the croppings at the surface of the ground. There are many which assay nearly as good as that. The Margaret White ledge, for instance, which belongs to the mill company—and many assay even better than that. But then, if they only average one hundred dollars to the ton, under the stamps, it is as good a thing as any one could ask.   A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU05.jpg,daily-union
DU06,"<p>COMO CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, Oct. 6th, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--Prominent among the notabilities of Como, is the Stone Saloon, kept by that great disciple and expounder of the black art known throughout the Pacific portion of Uncle Sam's dominion as ""Martin the Wizard."" This fine saloon is the place where Como-ites congregate together, and spend their leisure time smoking, playing cards, or reading the latest news and discussing the most important topics of public interest. Dealers in mining stocks here meet each other, and many is the big trade in ""feet"" consummated over a glass or so of the Wizard's ""best."" Here, also, meet the staunch old topers of the district, and warm up their jolly red noses with a small drop of good whisky, or fine old cognac. The saloon is fitted up in elegant style, regardless of expense, but the greatest attraction is the Wizard himself. Always the same genial, pleasing, and affable gentleman, ever ready with his mirth-provoking eccentricities and happy jokes, he has become one of the pets and fixtures of Como. He came here, in the course of his travels, some three months ago, and becoming smitten with the beauties of the place, and with the fine prospects of wealth which lay before him, he concluded to give up the show business, and has invested his ""pile"" here. He, of course, is now heavily interested in ""feet,"" and one rich claim, in which he owns a large share, is called in honor of himself the Wizard claim. It is on the Floridian ledge, and assays very rich. But notwithstanding that he has quit the show business, he still maintains his connection with old Beelzebub, who, through the instrumentality of the ""inexhaustible bottle,"" keeps the bar well stocked with choice liquors. Martin gets up one marvelous drink, called</p><p>THE WIZARD COCKTAIL.</p><p>It is a mysterious compound, of various remarkable elements. He puts in a little of the nectar of Jupiter, with some ambrosia of Venus, a drop or two of the oil of Joy, a little of the essence of Contentment, and a quantity of the spirits of Good Fellowship. He  gives it a shake up together, and with a peculiarly magical ""turn of the wrist"" he sets this wonderful drink before his customers. Sparkles of wit and humor dance within it, and the cream of a joke covers the surface as the glorious beverage bathes the lips of the devotees at the shrine of Bacchus. The effect of this marvelous drink are truly remarkable. The other day</p><p>TWO DEADLY ENEMIES</p><p>accidentally met in the Wizard saloon. Hate and blood-thirsty rage gleamed from their flashing eyes. They had longed for this meeting, and now were ready to tear each other's hearts out in deadly, unyielding strife; but preparatory to leaving this world in bloody embrace, the singular idea occurred to them of taking a last drink together. The Wizard concentrated all his magic powers in the preparation of a most superhuman cocktail. With knives and pistols drawn, they drank each other a speedy passage into eternity. They smacked their lips; they wiped their mouths; they got to telling funny stories; pawned their weapons for more cocktails, and got jolly tight. That night they slept together like brothers, under the same blanket, and are now sworn friends forever. To appreciate the whole story, however, people should give the Wizard a call.</p><p>COMO IMPROVING.</p><p>But joking aside, Como still continues rapidly to improve in size and population; and the public mind is every day kept in a continual state of excitement by newer and richer discoveries, as the numerous rich leads become more and more developed. I have spoken, in my former letters, of the various ledges most noted here, and told you what is known of their richness; now, in support of it, I must mention</p><p>THE ASSAYS OF MR. JOHN ROGERS,</p><p>a practical and highly talented assayer residing here, who has been for the last two months engaged in assaying the different ledges. He has very quietly assayed the Minerva, Shiloh, Monte Cristo, Wagram, Rey del Monte, Kremlin, Montgomery, Floridian, Montezuma, Rappahannock, and some dozen other ledges, all of which assayed well; some of them assaying as high as eight hundred dollars to the ton, in gold and silver. Most of them assayed four and five hundred, and the poorest fifty dollars to the ton. But the reality of all this he showed me in the shape of any quantity of big buttons of the bullion itself, some pieces weighing as high as three ounces. The most rock he tested from any one ledge was twenty-four pounds. He had to crush all these tests in a hand mortar—a most laborious process—and he is deserving of much credit for the untiring industry with which he has accomplished such rich results. For the satisfaction of the incredulous, I refer them to Mr. Rogers himself, who can show them the richness of the district in a tangible form, and for a fair compensation, will inform them as to the assay of each ledge; and his statements may be confidently relied upon. He has also a piece of rock from one of the ledges, which he submitted to the action of heat, until the silver was fused, and now remains all over the outside in the shape of round globules, of the size of goose shot. Such rock would pay two and three thousand dollars to the ton.</p><p>A SUGGESTION.</p><p>People who are inclined to rush blindly to the far off regions of Reese River or Humboldt, should open their eyes, and consider whether they may not find richer and more substantial mines near home. Just let them come here and take a fair examination, and they must be hopelessly stupid, if they cannot see and appreciate the real value of this flourishing district. A.

DU07,"<p>THE DAILY UNION.</p><p>COMO CORRESPONDENCE—THE INDIAN TROUBLES IN PALMYRA DISTRICT.</p><p>COMO, Oct. 18th, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: —At the present writing Como is in a state of war, and the men of Como are out with rifle in hand, ready to do battle against the common enemy—the confounded Pi-Utes. Palmyra District, as you know, comprises quite a large portion of the pine timber land of the Pi-Ute nation, and as at present the pine nuts are ripe the harvest of them by the Indians is the order of the day—they depending upon them as one of their chief sources of food. But the encroachments of the white man, in his greedy search for wealth, has caused the country hereabouts to be appropriated to the use of the American public, and the consequence is the nut-pine has had to suffer. From time to time the Indians have remonstrated, and sometimes threateningly; so much so as to induce some timid ones to flee from fancied danger. At this present season, however, the Indians are more in earnest than ever, in the fact that the District is attracting much attention—mills are being erected here, and, as a matter of course, the pine tree must soon be destroyed. Winnemucca, with an interpreter and his braves, were here last Monday, and told us we must cut ""no more green timber, until a treaty is made,"" or some other arrangement made whereby they might be indemnified for the loss of this timber and pine nuts. A very reasonable request, considering that they agreed that we might use all the dry, dead timber we wish for firewood, etc., of which there is plenty. For the last week there has been many flying rumors of war. But Indians have been gathering in in numbers, but as, of course, they have always done at every wet season in years before. Very few got much excited over it until about yesterday, when reports of threats on the part of the Indians were very currently reported. Along towards evening the topic of the day was warmly discussed, and some few of the most excited ones at last concluded to send for aid, as a flying rumor came to the effect that the Indians intended to attack and destroy the towns of Como and Palmyra that night. A messenger was sent to Dayton and from there a telegram was sent to Fort Churchill. Meanwhile a guard was formed, sentinels posted, many women and children were taken to the Wizard's big stone saloon and other places of safety, and such necessary precautions taken as were deemed necessary against surprise from the blood-thirsty, pine nut-eating Pi-Utes. The braves of course were on the Cindado. Their eyes were peeled and there was no earthly show in the world of a Pi-Ute, or ""any other man"" accomplishing anything in the hostile line. Your correspondent was down to Palmyra in the evening, and found the guards and sentinels on duty well armed with Uncle Sam's blue overcoat, a big rifle, a large hatchet, and a tremendous knife. The women were cool, unterrified, and not much nervous. Palmyra being safe, we came back to Como solitary and alone, but with a small piece of scantling about seven feet long in one hand ready to massacre any bloody Pi-Ute that should dare assault the reporter of the UNION from behind the sage brush. Como being also safe, we went to bed,</p><p>""To sleep, but not to dream</p><p>Aye, there’s the rub.""</p><p>The telegram to Fort Churchill was received at about 6 o'clock P. M., and in just twenty minutes, twenty men from company D, under the command of Lieut. Jewett were mounted and on their way for the seat of war, well armed with Sharpe's rifles and dragoon pistols. They took a rough, blind trail across the country, and, after a toilsome travel of eight hours and a half, at half past two o'clock this morning arrived at Como.</p><p>A squad from Dayton, under the command of Capts. Eagan, Warder, Acton, and others, arrived on foot about half an hour before the soldiers did, and affiliated with the rest of the guardians of Como.</p><p>When the troops arrived they found our brave forces ready to receive them with guns presented, aye, and cocked. They were ordered to halt and give account of themselves. They explained that they were honest ""Linkum sojers"" from Fort Churchill, come to rescue Como, and not Pi-Utes in disguise, upon which they were allowed unmolested to enter the town. So far all was very good, and although Como was safe enough before, yet the presence of these soldiers made safety double safe. What show was there for an enterprising Pi-Ute now? Tell me that.</p><p>The excitement of patrol and guard duty increased as daylight approached, which was not allayed by the occasional use of that kind of whisky which Rosecrans and Grant are said to make use of. At length the excitement reached its climax and boiled over. Some bodies saw each other, and thought they were Pi-Utes. The alarm was given by loud should of ""turn out!"" ""Corporal’s guard!"" ""Turn out!"" ""why in h-ll don’t you turn out?"" An excited butcher, aroused from his slumbers by the hubbub, grabbed his gun, with blood in his eye, and in trying to cap it, he accidentally discharged it, straight at the north star. This was enough. What few there were asleep bounced out at once to the rescue. But where were the Pi-Utes? Echo answers, Where?</p><p>The correspondent of the UNION was on hand, of course, as soon as he could get into his trowsers, and immediately seized his trusty jackknife, joined the assembled crowd and commenced taking items. Lieut. Jewett’s command stood calm and collected, and did not seem to understand what all the row was about; but this was owing to their ignorance. No more sleep in Como till morning.</p><p>Lieut Jewett's orders are to remain here, till the arrival of the Governor, who is expected to-day or to-morrow to arrange with the Pi-Utes. Well, seriously, this is as it should be. Give all their rights. Give even a dog his rights. Let us have a treaty with the Indians. They ask but simple justice and right, and are firm in their demands. They are right. But no more now. The stage is leaving. A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU07.jpg,daily-union

The big boiler is set in its place, the smoke stack rears its black form high above the broad roof, and the endless details of machinery and crushing apparatus are fast being placed in position.</p><p>We will soon be able to show you ""whats what,"" in the shape of rich bricks of bullion, such as people need not rush to Reese River after. And mind you, these bricks are not to be taken from little, attenuated two-inch ledges, but from big, well-defined heavy ones; we don't use any other kind here. They show for themselves.</p><p>REESE RIVER AND COMO.</p><p>Many who have gone from here to Reese River have returned, or are going to do so as soon as possible, saying that although money is plenty at Reese, and in reality that there are many good paying ledges there, yet the chances are as good here, and probably much better, besides this being much the best place to live in as regards location, building facilities, wood, water, and society. One enthusiastic victim goes so far as to say that he ""wouldn’t give ten acres of Palmyra District for the whole of Reese River.""</p><p>BOASTING OF A BIG HOTEL.</p><p>Cross has got his big three story hotel now nearly completed, and the architectural finish of it is a credit to this or any other place. We have needed this big source of accommodation to the traveling public for some time past, for although Daniel's and the other hotels are good ones, yet their limited accommodations are totally inadequate to the demands of the constantly increasing travel. Cross possess all the qualifications considered necessary to constitute a jolly landlord in an eminent degree, and it is understood that he ""can keep a hotel."" We shall see.</p><p>A NEW SALOON.</p><p>The fine saloon of ""Martin the Wizard,"" has now a powerful rival in the ""Como Exchange""—a large well furnished saloon, now opened and kept by the fat and jolly McComber, who is a standing proof that his liquors are of the best quality, for he uses them himself, and is liable to live for a hundred years or more, yet, to judge by his hearty robust frame, and blooming complexion. He has a splendid new billiard table, with all the latest improvements, while around the walls of the saloon are suspended big pictures, finished in the gayest style, showing Mc. To be a lover of the arts, as well as of good liquors. The M. C. to his name signifies Member of Congress, but, although, he does not understand the modus operandi of preparing the ""Wizard Cocktail,"" as prepared by the Wizard himself, yet he does make a cocktail that is as good as any Congressman ever drank, and the like of which would be tempting to temperance lecturers.</p><p>""JOE AND HIS LAGER.""</p><p>Joe, of whom I wrote in a former letter, has not got his brewery in full operation, and produces an article of ""lager"" that is, indeed, hard to beat. The Silver City lager has always borne the palm heretofore, but Joe's lager discounts that, without half trying. I don’t know whether it is the extra quality of the water, or the pure air here, or the splendid scenery that produces such marked superiority, but somehow this lager of Joe's possesses a flavor and body that cannot be surpassed at any other establishment. By invitation your correspondent visited the brewery at various times, and tested the qualities of the first, second, and third brewings, and pronounced them relatively good, better, and first rate. Success to the ""Como Brewery.""</p><p>SOCIETY IN COMO.</p><p>As to society here in this District, it cannot be excelled, either as to well behaved men, good looking women, or general sociability. We certainly do have capital good times here in the way of dances, social evening parties, music, etc., with no petty jealousies or aristocratic feelings to mar our pleasures. As to music, we have many excellent performers, and singers of varied merit.</p><p>THE ""COMO QUADRILLE BAND,""</p><p>Furnishes the music for all the dances, while among us are many who, although they have never displayed their great accomplishments in the vocal or instrumental line, on the theatrical stage before admiring audiences, are yet capable of astonishing people who ""never heard the like."" The principal glee club here, from a habit they have sometimes, of an evening, of going out and serenading, have acquired the name of the ""sage brush serenaders."" They are gentlemen of various talents and respectability; consisting of a lawyer, a stage driver, and a carpenter, and they can sing sea songs, negro melodies, and love songs, enough to melt the obdurate heart of a cobble stone.</p><p>A GOOD SERENADE—THE SLEEPING MAIDEN.</p><p>Palmyra being only a mile from Como, the other evening they concluded to astonish the natives ""of that quiet little town with a grand serenade."" The main object of this serenade—the first one ever given in Palmyra—was to charm the ladies of that place, and especially the fair daughter of the keeper of the chief hotel of the town. Silently, cautiously the ""sage-brush serenaders,"" gathered near the window of the sleeping maiden. Gently muttered were the curses, and vigorously bestowed was the small rock with which they quieted the fierce yelling of the retreating dog, that had mistaken them for Pi-Utes. And now, swelling clear upon the cool midnight air, as they stood in the calm moonlight, pealed the rich voices of the serenaders; sweetly rolled forth the voice of the brave soprano; high arose the voice of the agitated tenor, as he rose on his tip toes with excitement; the rich heavy notes of the tall bass swelled voluminously forth from far below his supper, and the three voices formed a combination of harmony, that to be appreciated should be heard. The song ceased. Was she awake. Did she hear the dulcet strains that were exhausting their sweetness on the midnight air. Oh! She must.</p><p>Again arose the united voices of the trio in richly blended harmony. Surely such strains would melt the heart of a flat-iron. Eagerly they watched the window of her bedroom. See! Look! Was that a match she had rubbed? Was it a light she had struck that caused the refulgent glow upon the window. No! She had simply opened her eyes, and was now conscious to the presence of the music charms which saluted her ears. The object was accomplished. She was awake, and listening to the dulcet strains now being executed, all for her. Your correspondent being in the vicinity also heard the whole thing, and unhesitatingly pronounces it a remarkable serenade.</p><p>A LETHARGIC LANDLORD AND AN OBDURATE BAR-KEEPER.</p><p>But how was it with the other inmates of the hotel? Did they hear it? The worthy father of the young lady knows how to keep a hotel, and like a good landlord lay soundly sleeping after the fatigues of the day, so soundly that he never heard the music at all. The ""bar-keep"" heard it, but it being a frosty night, and having ""no music in his soul,"" he wouldn't get up and call in the serenaders and ""stand treat,"" no, not he. In explaining the thing next day, he said he ""heard it all, but thought they were come down there to 'shiveree' somebody"" at first, but he at last came to the conclusion that they were ""singing for the whisky, and be derned if he was going to treat on any such music as that."" The other ladies of Palmyra were duly serenaded, and at Arnhold's the serenaders were called in and treated to an unlimited amount of lager, but as the most of the ladies serenaded were married, the interest of the performance was correspondingly diminished. The sage brush serenaders flatter themselves that the Palmyra ladies will remember this sweet serenade until next time. So you see, Mr. Editor, that we do manage to wring along, regardless of the blood-thirsty savage Pi-Utes. These Indians have got about through their pine-nut harvest, and nearly all left for Pyramid Lake and other parts. The district is perfectly safe, as far as they are concerned, and as to that matter always has been.    A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU08.jpg,daily-union
DU09,"<p>[November 12, 1863]</p><p>Our Como Correspondence.</p><p>Como, Nov. 9, 1863.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:—Night has spread her sable mantle over Como, but although it is ten o'clock in the evening one could hardly say that the citizens of our usually quiet town were all abed, to judge from the noise in certain quarters.</p><p>SOCIAL LIFE IN COMO—MUSIC AND LAGER.</p><p>Music fills the balmy air, and loud is the merry song, and full the chorus borne to our ears, from the ""Como Brewery."" A lot of ""gay and festive cusses"" are there congregated together testing the quality of that lager. The grand chief violinist of Como is with them; his ever happy grin wreathing his lovely dark countenance, and such strains as he is extracting from that old cracked fiddle would make Ole Bull or Paganini just shoot themselves, from pure envy. And then there is somebody down there concentrating his energies on a sort of post horn arrangement, and quite a ""blower"" he is, too. Well, as the prophet Joe Smith says, ""blessed is he who bloweth his own horn; for whoso bloweth not his own horn, the same shall not be blowed; and whoso bloweth his own horn, the same shall be blowed with a vengeance."" He and the fiddler are evidently playing against each other. They have had two heavy rounds at it, and are not ""playing the rub."" Go in! I'll bet on that old fiddle. ""Merry feet are dancing"" during the intervals of the songs, and the feast of music and flow of lager will probably continue a while longer, for I hear them now singing something about ""we won't go home till morning."" From McCumber's saloon can be heard the sound of the rattling balls on the billiard table, and the happy shouts of laughter from the crowd who assemble there to chat around the big stove and partake of a cocktail or so.</p><p>JOKES AND APOLOGIES.</p><p>Well, now, if I have been anyways too personal in any of the foregoing remarks, I hope the aggrieved parties will accept my apologies. I must be careful how I joke, for I got into quite a scrape by reason of some inadvertent jokes in my last letter, regarding the ""serenade"" at Palmyra by the ""Sage-brush Serenaders."" One person, imagining himself aggrieved, came down personally on your correspondent in a volley of rough-shot language that made us tremble in our boots. We humbly agreed to make ""all necessary apology,"" which we accordingly do, after having read the aforesaid letter over, and finding nothing worth apologizing for. We freely accept his apologies also, or ""any other man,"" and promise to never joke again if we can help it.</p><p>SPEAKING OF PALMYRA,</p><p>I intend, in a future letter, to refer more particularly to the mines around that portion of the district as many of the richest ledges are located near there. The Rappahannock, Orizaba, War Eagle, Buckeye, Crittenden and the Union, are among the best. From a piece of rock from the War Eagle, which had been subjected to the action of heat, I saw the pure native silver smelted out, and covering the entire surface in coarse round globules. Many of these ledges have already been tested at Dayton by mill process, and found to be unmistakably rich, and now they are awaiting the erection of mills, to work them to advantage. The mill here in Como is very nearly completed, and I understand will commence testing rock from the various claims in a few days by means of the small prospecting battery, which will be run while the big batteries are being got ready.</p><p>ABOUT CLAIMS.</p><p>Many of the claims which have been for some time lying idle, are now having the work started on them again. The Shiloh, for instance, is now getting out a crushing of rich rock for the mill. On the Dakota ledge, the Perkins & Arrington claim has a shaft down 120 feet, and have a ledge of rich pay rock, enough to supply a large mill of itself. The Montezuma, adjoining it, on the same ledge, has any quantity of rock which assays rich.</p><p>ABOUT REESE RIVER.</p><p>It is pleasing to see how completely the mining public are becoming undeceived with regard to the fading glories of Reese river. For awhile ""distance lent enchantment to the view,"" and many an unwary speculator got taken in and done for—first, by being shown rich specimens from the numerous little, thin, two-inch ledges of that delectable region; or, still worse, they were humbugged by means of Gould & Curry, Savage, and other rich rock from Virginia, hauled out there and made to represent Reese River rock. It is indeed high time that such an unhealthy state of affairs should be ""played out."" All such things, sooner or later, find their real level, and have to stand on their own bottom—if they have any. Those who went from here to see the Reese River elephant, have returned, perfectly satisfied to get back home to Palmyra District, where, in their old claims, they have the assurance of fortunes, in the shape of good, well-defined, wide ledges of rich rock—ledges which show for themselves, and which are fast coming into the notice of outside capitalists and on the sound basis of true merit. The whole world will, in the course of a few months, hear of Palmyra District. A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU09.jpg,daily-union
DU10,"<p>THE DAILY UNION.</p><p>COMO CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, N. T. Nov. 16th, 1863.</p><p>GENERALITIES.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: —At the present writing, things here have a decidedly wintry appearance, but we have the consolation of being able to look across the valley at your elevated locality, and see that you also are enjoying the same snowy surroundings. I should rather say that we look down upon you, for Como is elevated many feet higher than Virginia, which may account for the fluctuating vagaries of the present ""spell of weather."" We have it in all sorts of variety. In the language of the poet, ""first it blew, then it snew, then it thew, and then it frizz."" —which latter position we hold at present, with a fine prospect of more snow. ""Now is the winter of our discontent,"" is one of the remarks of the immortal Shakspeare; but lack of blankets, scarcity of funds, and poor credit, was probably the occasion of such an uncomfortable idea on his part. But we of Como don't apply the remark to our case, for this is the very winter that is to bring out our thriving district to the notice of an admiring world.</p><p>OUR MILL.</p><p>To-morrow the echoes from the pine-clad, snowy hills around us, will for the first time be awakened by the shrill whistle of that big mill of which I have so often written, and upon which the future of this district mostly depends. That whistle will be hailed with joy by hundreds of hopeful hearts, who have long toiled, and waited patiently the results of their labors. Day after to-morrow the small prospecting battery of two stamps which is attached to this mill will start, crushing rock from the Monte Cristo ledge. This little battery will only crush about a ton per day. It is a perfect counterpart of the large batteries, with pans and all complete, and will be just a ""foretaste of the joys to come,"" when the big batteries get into full operation, which will be in about two weeks.</p><p>ANOTHER NEW HOTEL.</p><p>Cross has just opened his crack hotel. He opened it with a ""grand flourish"" by inviting all the boys in to ""drink and be merry"" on the occasion. Of course the boys responded, and during the evening some two hundred or so registered their names in the big book, as ""arrivals"" at the National Hotel. The Como quadrille band turned out in full force, and did the music for the occasion, assisted by the celebrated bugler from the Como brewery, who kindly volunteered his services. Your correspondent, being possessed of large quantitites of ""music in his soul,"" was attracted thither by the entrancing strains of elodious harmony, and sat and quiety enjoyed the thing to his heart's content. But the banjo player attracted our attention principally. He is a dark-eyed, melancholy ""cuss,"" who seems to be eternally brooding over the sorrows of his youth, and desperately endeavoring to revenge all his imaginary wrongs, by picking and thumping the very soul out of that unfortunate old banjo. Well, perhaps it's a consolation to him, and far be it from me to begrudge him that poor boon. He has been crossed in love, at some time or other; or, perhaps, he is the silent victim on unrequited affection.</p><p>"" 'He never told his love,' but feels it ever</p><p>Gnawing at his heart, like a worm</p><p>At the core of a sweet apple.""</p><p>I would recommend to him a diet of doughnuts and larger beer. Cross' bar is well stocked with the choicest liquors ever brought into this Territory, and it is fully sufficient to say that he gets all his lager from the Como brewery; lager, which for body and fine flavor, has no superior anywhere. The hotel is large, roomy and well ventilated, and is plentifully supplied with water from a spring which comes out of the hill in the rear of the hotel at an elevation which carries the water by means of iron pipes up into the second story. The rooms are all carpeted and furnished with the choicest of sleeping arrangements, and every convenience one could wish. In the third story is a large hall, 50 by 30 feet in size, which will be used for balls and parties, or a ""corral,"" as occasion may require. The kitchen department is unexceptionable in its arrangements. The stove, or cooking range, is of the ""Monitor"" style, and with its complex arrangements of pipes, pans, and warming and steaming apparatus, reminds one of a young quartz mill. A mysterious sort of hot air pipe arrangement proceeds from it to a barrel of water in the corner of the room by which means the water in the barrel is kept boiling, and from it are pipes which lead to the sink, where the boarders wash themselves, and to other places where hot water is required. For perfection of plan, and general convenience and comfort, this hotel is not excelled at least by any hotel in Virginia. Cross is an experienced landlord and a gentleman, and far from being what his name indicates. His flag is the glorious old Star Spangled Banner; his sentiments are thoroughly Union, and his paper is the VIRGINIA DAILY UNION,  which will always be found on his table, as it is in all other first class hotels. Success to the National Hotel; ""long may it wave.""</p><p>THE MINES.</p><p>Among the mining claims in this district most worthy of mention is the Kremlin, on the Cash ledge. This is a ""blind"" ledge, showing no croppings, and was accidentally discovered about a year ago, in sinking a shaft. The ledge is well defined and upwards of eight feet in width, and is considered among the most valuable. It is to be seen on the map of this town, and by many it is believed to be identical with the celebrated Wagram ledge. They certainly run very near each other, and perhaps are the same; time will show. The shaft of the Kremlin is down to the depth of fifty feet, and forty pounds of the rock from this shaft sent to San Francisco yielded by the milling process sixty dollars to the ton. Assays have been obtained from it of from four to six hundred dollars to the ton. Sixty dollars under the stamps, however, is good enough. The Kremlin was incorporated on the 30th of last May, and the stock is held at ten dollars per foot, at present; but the anticipates results from the new mill, after it gets into full operation, will carry all good feet away high up in the hundreds.

DU11,"<p>THE DAILY UNION.</p><p>LETTER FROM COMO</p><p>[Correspondence of the Virginia Daily Union.]</p><p>COMO, November 20th, 1863.</p><p>THE FIRST MILL HAS STARTED.</p><p>""Blow ye the trumpet, blow!"" for the accepted time has come at las, and the big steam whistle has sounded forth with a most joyful sound, the like of which was never heard before since the creation. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, Mrs. Mette, the wife of the Superintendent, with her own hands, caused the whistle to sound, and started the engine; therefore to her belongs the honor of having started the first mill in this district. Everything worked splendidly, and during the afternoon the little prospecting battery of two stamps was run, crushing some rock from the ""Jessie"" claim. Nothing could work better—it was like clockwork, and a perfect success. Of course during the afternoon the mill did not lack for visitors, as we all have long and anxiously looked forward towards the completion of this mill. The Como Brewery furnished an unlimited amount of lager on the occasion, which had the effect to produce a general feeling of happiness and good fellowship, as this delicious beverage is composed principally of the ""milk of human kindness."" The prospecting battery will crush a ton or a ton and a half in twenty-four hours, and as the process is precisely the same a the big batteries, the yield of bullion will be proportionably the same. The large battery of ten stamps will be completed about the first of December. The engine is forty horse-power, and capable of running three such batteries; and the building is so arranged that more stamps can easily be added when it shall be deemed advisable. Six of the largest sized ""Wheeler"" pans will be run at the first; and the whole cost of the mill, when complete, will be nearly sixty thousand dollars. A more substantial, better planned or more thoroughly executed piece of work of the kind does not exist in this Territory. Great credit is due to the Superintendent Mr. F. J. Mette, the clear headed, indomitable originator of this enterprise. To Mr. J. S. Aiken, the contractor and builder, this mill stands as a monument of the untiring energy and zeal with which he has thus far pushed forward his undertaking to a successful completion. He has had hundreds of unforeseen difficulties and extra expenses to content with, and will not make anything at all on his contract; but he will have the proud satisfaction of knowing that no one else could have done the job any better. There is plenty of room for more mills, both here and at Palmyra, but parties intending to erect mills here should at once be on the lookout to secure the best locations. Como, being built on a warm, sunny slope, we are but little troubled with snow, as it melts off very soon after it falls, so that our streets are now in the best possible condition, the nature of the soil—a fine gravelly loam—precluding the idea of mud, of which you seem to have such an abundant supply.</p><p>A HOME PRODUCTION.</p><p>Under the head of ""home production,"" I must make especial note of the fine boy baby that was born last Sunday night, to the wife of Thos. R. Hawkins, Esq. It is the first white child born in this District, and weighed eight pounds. Various causes have been assigned why there has been no increase in the families here. Some laid it to the climate, and some said it was the water; but whatever it may have been, the lager from the Como brewery has a decidedly counteracting influence, for it is but two months since the first brewing, and see the result: one fine boy already, and several other ladies are reported to be ——</p><p>THE MINES.</p><p>The Wizard claim, on the Floridian ledge, is fast increasing in favor among those who desire to possess good ""feet."" A fine tunnel has been run to the distance of thirty-seven feet, and when they strike the ledge, they are sure of finding it rich, for the Floridian ledge has long been known as among the best, it assaying invariably rich. This claim, as I said in a former letter, was named in honor of ""Martin, the Wizard,"" who still continues to hold forth at the Stone saloon, where he supplies the thirsty sinners of the District, ""or any other man,"" with those same renowned ""Wizard cocktails,"" of which we read. The Wizard is a gentleman, ""with a hand for his friend, and balls for his foes.""</p><p>IMMIGRATION.</p><p>There are many strangers coming here for the last few days, and the hotels are in demand. From present appearances, I may have to report a ""rush"" here this winter, instead of waiting till next spring. A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU11.jpg,daily-union
DU12,"<p>LETTER FROM COMO.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Virginia Daily Union.]</p><p>COMO, November 30th, 1863</p><p>WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO TURN UP.</p><p>Micawber was the man, you recollect, that was always waiting for something to ""turn up."" No, there are a great many of the genus Micawber here in this district, who are eternally waiting and watching in ever anxious expectancy of something new to ""turn up,"" and these last few days they have been gratified quite often, for stirring events are casting their shadows before, and ""every day brings something new"" in the shape of onward progression and improvement.</p><p>Shooting.</p><p>A few evenings ago, two men who had been partaking freely of numerous belligerent cocktails, got into a friendly quarrel at the supper table, which resulted in one of them producing a five shooter and blazing away across the table at the other. The muzzle of the pistol being only some four or five feet from the bridge of his nose, at point blank range, he would have been killed, dead as a hammer, had it not been for the steward, who sprang forward and turned up the muzzle of the weapon, just in time, the ball passing up through the ceiling. Of course, the man with the pistol was quickly and roughly hustled out of doors, but his friend, just quietly went on eating, as though nothing had happened, merely remarking something about a ""poor shot,"" etc. He coolly finished his supper, and didn't get his mad up until he got through picking his teeth. He then waxed somewhat profane, but forgave his friend on the score than he ""must have been crazy when he shot off the pistol."" He was about as cool a man as I ever saw. These men were just arrived in town, from California, but some of the Comoites took item on the occasion, and for a day or two afterwards, whenever they got into a quarrel, out came their pistols; but no one has been shot yet, although, if we only keep on in the same ratio of improvement, we shall be able yet to brag of a ""man for breakfast,"" just like you Virginia folks. When we shall have attained that point of perfection, I hope the next improvement introduced will be a vigilance committee.</p><p>Assay Office.</p><p>The new assaying and refining establishment of L. Solomon is now completed, and in full blast. He is fully prepared to make all sorts of assays and chemical tests, at reasonable rates. He has three splendid furnaces; one for cupelling, one for chemical operations and experiments, and the other for melting purposes, in which he can melt half a ton of bullion per day. It is a very creditable establishment for this or any other place. Mr. Solomon is a gentleman, and fully understands his business. He is assisted by his son, and can hardly fail to do well here. He has made assays of the rock from but few claims as yet, but he finds the rock generally much richer than he had expected. I understand he is to have the supervision of the first crushings of the mill, in order that the best method of working the rock of this district may be sooner found out.</p><p>Telegraph to Como.</p><p>The wires of the California State Telegraph are now extended to this place, and the poles are nearly all erected between here and Dayton. It will soon be all completed, and an office established here, enabling Como to chat with her elder sister, Virginia, as though they were sitting side by side. Our brokers can post you every ten minutes as to the price of feet in the Montezuma, and your brokers can post us in regard to the Comstock; and should the bloodthirsty Pi-Utes ever take a notion again to make a descent upon Como, we will have no difficulty in calling assistance. This telegraph is a capital arrangement.</p><p>Hotels, Etc.</p><p>When the National Hotel was completed, some three weeks ago, many said it was too large; too fine a building for the place; in fact, altogether ahead of the times; but that was a mistake, for so many strangers have come in lately that the house is full; and, in fact, Cross has had to turn away many, but he is extending his arrangements so as to be able to accommodate all who give his well known hospitalities the preference. But then we are pretty well off now in the way of stopping places for the weary and hungry traveler, for, besides the National, and Daniel's Hotel, we have the Pioneer Restaurant, kept by F. Hampel & Co., the accommodations of which are very superior. Their beds are A No. 1, the grub ""esta buena""—especially those fine porter house steaks which they get from the butcher shop next door. They get their lager from the Como brewery. Of the French Restaurant of Mons. Beliard, I need not speak. Mons. Beliard has his family with him; he is at home; and all who eat at his house, find themselves at home, and in the enjoyment of such a meal as can only be found at just such a place. It is a French restaurant.</p><p>Excitement among Lot Owners.</p><p>Some little excitement was created in town to-day, by the title to some half dozen of the blocks in the center of the town being called into question. Certain parties claim to have located a mill site there, prior to the survey of the town site, and how, by virtue of said location, claim the ground, and to-day served the preliminary papers of an ejectment suit, claiming possession of the ground, and twenty-five thousand dollars damages. It comprises quite an extent of valuable buildings and property, and will be well contested. Well, lawsuit goes—business for the lawyers—go in—don't care which whips—don't own an inch of it.</p><p>Among the Mines.</p><p>Yesterday I took a stroll over to the Sonora ledge, about a mile and a half southeast of town. The Sonora is a fine ledge, running nearly north and south, and is esteemed among the best ledges in the district. The shaft of McDowell & Co., at the depth of fifty feet, struck water, and the rock at that depth, shows rich in chloride and bromide of silver, as well as plenty of gold. Feet in that claim are not for sale. The Eureka claim, on the same ledge, struck water at the depth of fifteen feet, and they will have to erect steam pumping apparatus for keeping their shaft free of water. It is a very valuable claim, and the owners of it have a large fortune before them. All they have to do is to ""go in and win."" It is a splendid location. Near the ledge is a large flowing spring of the best water, enough to run two or three mills. Mr. McDowell has secured a large mill site here, which is very valuable—perhaps the best in the district, with an abundance of wood in the vicinity, enough to last for years to come.  A.

DU13,"<p>LETTER FROM COMO.</p><p>[Correspondence of the Virginia Daily Union.]</p><p>COMO, December 7th, 1863</p><p>New and Rich Strikes.</p><p>For the past week, the usual equanimity of our flourishing community has become somewhat disturbed by the excitement consequent upon the discovery of another rich quartz load some two or three miles from town, near the head of Star Canon, just within the borders of Indian Springs District. The ledge shows heavy croppings of a soft, chalky, porous rock, with purple spots and streaks running through it, and of a nature entirely different from the rest of the ledges of the District. It is said by those who pretend to know, that it is just like the rock in the claim at Gold Hill known as Gold Hill Proper. The ledge has, within the last year or more, been located by various parties, but the rock looked so unpromising that no one ever cared to work it, until Sunday, the 29th ult., when Mr. J. C. Murphy and others took a notion to try it. They roasted some of the rock, and were somewhat surprised to see the silver come out in little globules all over the surface. Of course they secured the claim at once, and a careful assay of the rock at the assay office of Mr. Solomon gave a return of over two hundred dollars to the ton in gold and silver, principally silver. Several other assays showed not quite so rich, but still very satisfactory, and, as a matter of course, extensions upon extensions have been taken up; and any one that does not possess ""feet"" in the ""White Point""--as the new discovery is called--is deemed highly unfortunate. It is believed by many to be a portion of the far-famed Whitman Ledge, which, I see by the papers, crushes at the Sacramento Mill a hundred dollars to the ton. The Great Eastern is the name of another big ledge recently discovered some seven miles from here, on the trail to Fort Churchill. It shews immense croppings which can be traced for three miles, and from some of the rock globules of silver can be roasted out in abundance. It is undoubtedly very rich. It was discovered by some of the German residents of this town, and is owned and worked exclusively by Germans. A few feet in the Great Eastern would be very acceptable to almost any one. Four days ago we took a tramp in that direction, that our eyes might be gratified with a view of the redoubtable Great Eastern. A certain long-legged Attorney of this town, was our pilot. We went round by the Constitution ledge, stopping as we passed, to take a look at the Altamonte, Buena Vista, Banner, and other noted tunnels, running into the ledge, often diverging from our course, in order to prospect some promising looking croppings and ""indications."" Over the rough hills and across the deep gulches, our long-legged pilot led the way at terrific pace. We tried hard to ""follow in the footsteps of our illustrious predecessor,"" but his footsteps were too far apart, and what with his long legs against our short ones, it took all the sail we could possibly crowd on to make even a respectable stern chase of it. But we ""saw the elephant""--the Great Eastern--and when night overtook us on our way back, it found us faint, weary and alone--our pilot having long since disappeared--three miles from home and just able to crawl. But we were all right, for we came to the cabin of J. Eaton, our brother miner and a true Christian gentleman, who, in full appreciation of our ""fagged out"" condition, treated us to a loaf of warm bread and butter, considerable boiled beef, and some hot tea. When he dies--which I hope he never will--may the blessing of the hungry waft his soul aloft to dwell in Paradise forever. Considerably recuperated, we took leave of him, and over sage-brush and rocks--for it was too dark to see the trail--up hill and down dale we pursued our weary way; bah! the ""road over Jordan"" is a fine turnpike to the one we traveled. Two hours after dark we arrived home, hopelessly crippled in body and sole for the next four days, with two blistered heels and bloody socks. There I found my pilot sitting before the fire, with those legs cock-billed high above the mantel-piece, quietly smoking his evening pipe over the interesting pages of Blackstone's ""Commentaries,"" apparently refreshed  by his lice little walk. But "" 'tis ever thus"" with him. He can travel. What cares he for a crooked trail? He just steps across the crooks, and walks over rocks that I have to go around. And so it would be with the narrow way to Heaven; he could step ""across lots"" while I would have to go round; and while I would have to knock at the gate he would just step over the fence.</p><p>Taxing the Mines.</p><p>And now, while I am on the subject, in speaking of mines and mining, I will give you not only my sentiments but what I consider to be the sentiments of the mining community of this district generally, upon the subject of the taxation of the mines. The Constitutional Convention seem to deem it necessary to have all the mines taxed, more or less, and the idea may be an excellent one--it may be a splendid one--but the miners of this district can't see it, neither can our business men. The fact is, the mines are taxed enough already. Every paying mine that is opened costs enormously in the way of labor, time, money and materials. In that way these mines in this district have been taxed, until all who have been here any length of time are poor as church mice. To be sure, we are rich in ""feet,"" which may one day assume the character of table property, but until such a happy state of affairs shall be proven by the regular milling process, we ask the benefit of the doubt. It isn't possible to fix a market valuation on undeveloped mines. Of course, you may see in the stock market report, every day, ""Rappahannock, $40 asked,"" ""Exchange, $20 asked,"" and every claim in the district could be easily represented in the same way, but, because a man to-day holds his Montezuma at $30, it is no sign that to-morrow he may not sell it for $5; and because he sells it at $5 you must not fix the market value at that, and tax it accordingly, for he might be troubled to find another customer who would buy it at $3 and pay the cash. And then, too, read the columns of the UNION, under the head of ""Assessment Sales,"" and see the names of the delinquents that are troubled to raise the loose cash to pay their assessments, many that are actually required in the opening and developing of the mines. If more taxes are to be levied on top of that, how can a poor fellow get along? Again, every certificate of stock that is issued or transferred is taxed to the amount of twenty-five cents, in the shape of a revenue stamp, which most certainly goes to the support of Government, and you know these certificates are more numerous than Dayton flies in summer. Wild cat and all has to stand the tax in that way. And then, too, there are many claims, the Altamonte, for instance, stock in which is selling at $10 per share, and all there is to show for it is a 400 feet tunnel, with a strong prospect, some time or another, of striking a rich ledge, if they don't miss it. If there proves to be no ledge there, please to tell us the market value. There is one claim here that a few weeks ago sold at $7.50 per foot, cash. It is very, very cheap, now, for they never had any ledge at all in it. It went up on the wild cat process, and came down ditto. On another claim certain individuals, who believe in the ""patience and perseverance"" doctrine, have sunk a shaft and are running drifts each way in solid granite, strong in the delusion that there is a ""rich ledge there, somewhere;"" some of them wouldn't sell out their interests for less than $5 per foot; but to call that the ""market value,"" and tax it accordingly, would be like taxing the chances in a game of ""bean poker."" Only last week, too, a sale was effected of ten feet in the Juniper, at $9 per foot, in lottery tickets. Now there would be the same propriety in taxing the lottery tickets that there would be in taxing the claim. Some tell us we should pay taxes, same as the farmers and merchants have to do. They should remember that we help the farmer and merchant pay their taxes in every sack of flour or potatoes we buy, and but for us farmers and merchants would be in small demand in this sweet country. No, our mines are taxed enough already. I voted for the Constitution of California, in the winter of '49, and hope to vote for the Constitution of Nevada, but with that clause in it taxing the mines, I tell you it will not be accepted by the people of Nevada. The miners will be apt to think we can do better to remain as we are, a Territory. In about five years from now, when we will be having some net proceeds in the way of dividends to pay taxes with, then it might do to tax such ""net proceeds,"" but any other method of taxing the mines is decidedly objectionable to many others, as well as to   A.

DU14,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, December 26, 1863.</p><p>Christmas in Como.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: A pleasanter day than was yesterday, here in Como, is rarely to be seen, and was just such a day as Christmas day always should be. The town being situated on a warm sunny slope, our cheerful streets presented a genial contrast to the cold, snow covered slopes and hillsides, whose faces are inclined to the north.</p><p>Several gay cavaliers, with their fair ladies by their side, seated in fine buggies, on a Christmas visit to the place, dashed up and down the streets, visiting the mill and other points of interest. The day before Christmas our citizens assisted in raising a splendid flag staff over the National Hotel, and, amid rousing cheers, the glorious old starry flag of the American Union was set floating in the breeze; ""Rally round the Flag,"" and the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" were then sung, and the jollity of the occasion wound up with numerous horns of Cross's ""best."" Glory to that proud banner; a more beautiful flag never floated in the sunlight of heaven' ""long may it wave.""</p><p>Christmas Eve was celebrated by a grand ball. The first ""Annual Ball,"" for we intend to have one just like it every Christmas from now henceforth through all future ages. Truly it was a grand affair, and pronounced by all who were fortunate enough to be ""thar,"" the best ball ever gotten up in this Territory. Well, anyhow, it couldn't be beat. There were some thirty ladies present, including several from Dayton and elsewhere, and all of them good looking, none of them being at all homely. The men of Como were in clover for the time being, and all hands joined heartily in the ""gay and festive"" scene, with a zest hardly to be equaled. In fact, I never saw anything of the kind, where all the participants seemed so thoroughly to enjoy the festivities of the occasion. The weather was fine, the accommodation perfect, and nothing occurred to mar in the least the pleasures of all concerned. The music was by the Como Quadrille Band; a combination of talent not often to be met with in this sage brush country, and the ball was held in Cross's new hall, in the third story of the National Hotel, which building, with all its perfect and elaborate accommodation, was placed at the disposal of the gay company. At midnight, all hands partook of a grand supper, gotten up in Cross's best style. Nothing more need be said of it. It was ""bully"" and no mistake. It can't be beat nowhere. The ball was kept up with undiminished enjoyment until about daylight next morning, and was a most decided success in every point.</p><p>Political Meetings.</p><p>I had nearly forgotten to mention that, in the evening, before the ball commenced, there was a political meeting held at the Como Exchange, which was addressed by Judge Haydon, and F. M. Kennedy, Esq., of Dayton, and Dr. Ellis, of Carson. Of course the new Constitution for the embryo State of Nevada, was the grand subject of discussion; Haydon and Kennedy taking the right loyal Union, sound, patriotic side; while Ellis discussed it in the light in which the Copperheads view it. Which side made the most convert, will be seen about the next election day. Another meeting was held this afternoon at Cross's Hall, which was addressed by F. H. Kennedy, Hon. William H. Virden, and G. A. Brier, Esq., of this town. Four delegates were chosen to attend the Union County Convention, to be held at Dayton on the 29th instant, viz: J. S. Crossman, Wm. H. Virden, G. W. Walton, and Alfred Doten. On the evening stage from Dayton, Judge Williams arrived, and will address the citizens here to-morrow forenoon.</p><p>Minstrels.</p><p>This evening Bryant and Case's minstrels performed at Cross's Hall, to a very full audience. This troupe comprises much fine talent, and their performance was much applauded by their delighted audience. They deserve crowded houses, and will draw then, wherever they may go. The performance was concluded, by the appearance of ""Martin,"" the celebrated ""wizard,"" who gave us specimens of his wonderful powers as magician and ventriloquist. He is closely allied to the old gentleman with the cloven feet.</p><p>Picnic at White Point.</p><p>Last Monday we had a small picnic party at White point, about two miles out from town, near the new Whitman road. Several of the ladies and gentlemen of Como took advantage of the fine warm day, and enjoyed a pleasant little time. By special invitation your correspondent composed one of the party, and enjoyed it as much as anybody—at least he thinks so. The road winds on an even grade around the hill sides, among the shady pines, and is quite a romantic little walk or drive. All of us, however, preferred walking. The romance and interest of the scene was not a little heightened by a comical looking turn-out, in the shape of a couple of long-eared, sober-sided jackasses, which were hitched ""tandem"" to a cart, and driven by three little boys. This ""team"" transported the eatables, &c., and preceded the expedition to the place selected for the picnic, which was a small shady grove, near the far-famed White Point ledge. The weather was highly propitious, and all enjoyed the pleasures of the occasion to the fullest extent, even to one poor melancholy young man, who mounted a tall rock, at the imminent risk of his pantaloons, and sitting astraddle thereon, poured forth his doleful feelings in the strains of a plaintive flute, which he had brought along in his pocket for the purpose. We took a small survey of the mining operations at that point, which are as yet rather limited, the ledge being but recently discovered. The Crossman Company is the original location on the ledge. In the cut they are running into the ledge they find some very good ore. The Lee and Weston, the first north extension, have run in with their tunnel some thirty-five feet, and have struck splendid looking rock, as has also the Roberts Company in their tunnel, which is in only some 15 or 20 feet. After eating up most of the eatables and taking a survey of the wealth and romantic scenery of the place for an hour or so, the party returned to town, well pleased with their picnic.</p><p>First Marriage in Palmyra.</p><p>On that day also the first wedding of the District came off at Palmyra. We had not the pleasure of being present on the interesting occasion, but we had the felicity of enjoying a piece of the wedding cake. Joy be ever with the happy pair, and may the sunshine of their wedded happiness be ever unclouded.</p><p>The Live Oak, etc.</p><p>The ""Live Oak"" is a claim lately incorporated, and which promises to be one of the most important claims in the district. It is located near the mill, on the George Law ledges, Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The tunnel will strike all three of these ledges at from 150 to 200 feet below the surface, and from the mouth of the tunnel a track can be laid directly to the mill, thus saving a considerable item in the way of transportation. The tunnel will also probably strike considerable of a stream of water, which will be very valuable of itself as a mill privilege.</p><p>The proprietors of the Live Oak are poor, hard-working men, willing to go on and develop the claim and bring forth its long-hidden treasures for the benefit of the world, but they don't want their mine taxed until they can get out some silver to pay the taxes with. They are told that that mining taxation clause in the Constitution don't mean anything, and even if it did, the Legislature has all the power, and will fix the thing all right. Such being the case, they think the Convention must have been fooling away their time when they got up that clause. They had better left it to the Legislature and said nothing about it. A.

DU15,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, January 7, 1864.</p><p>Our Towns and Other Towns.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--Having but just returned from your portion of Silverland, I could not help comparing the resources of this district with those of the older localities, and Palmyra suffered none in the comparison. To be sure, our mines are not developed at all compared with those of Virginia and Gold Hill, and our houses are not so close together; but we will soon prove to you that our mines are noways inferior, and Como will soon be a powerful rival of even Virginia. The little town of Palmyra, too, must also rise in importance until it was assume the same position in relation to Como, that Gold Hill does to Virginia.</p><p>Palmyra District.</p><p>This district has rapidly come into favor during the past season, upon its own merits alone, for we have plenty of ledges here, and good ones too. Many of them have already been tested under the stamps of our new mill, and found to be even richer than was anticipated. We have no wild-cat claims here; we don't have occasion to use the article, having plenty of well-defined, good regular-paying ledges. In regard to some of them, we shall soon be able to tell you stories of their richness that will cause your optical organs to project, and we shall show you the ""bricks,"" too, in support of our position.</p><p>Edgerton- - -Hotels.</p><p>Hon. Henry Edgerton is at present honoring Como with his august presence, and to-night sweetly snoozes in one of the comfortable beds at the National Hotel; but although the accommodations there are hard to beat, yet I'll bet he sleeps no sweeter or more comfortable than we did at the Robert's House in Dayton, or at Vesey's Hotel at Gold Hill, both of which houses are kept in a highly creditable manner, by very gentlemanly landlords. But then the traveling public know all about that.</p><p>Gold Hill and its Mills.</p><p>We also took a passing observation of the numerous thumping, groaning, and squeaking quartz mills about Gold Hill, which seemed eternally striving with each other to see which could make the most noise, especially about noon time, when for the space of two or three hours they blew twelve and one o'clock whistles, in a manner highly bewildering to a stray Comoite, and perfectly regardless of either time or tune. I think each one of those mills must keep the ""mean time"" of Gold Hill. And then, too, that mulatto-colored stream, which goes winding laboriously down the canon, after being beaten to death, and torn, smashed and ground in all the mills, until I wondered how it could ever freeze together again. It does freeze, though.</p><p>The Rhode Island Mill.</p><p>But the best mill anywhere about that locality, is the Rhode Island mill, both as regards perfection of plan, details of workmanship, and general substantiability. The machinery and everything about it, works like clock work, and with one-half the noise and clatter of the other mills. It is a large building, intended for a twenty-stamp mill, but at present only ten stamps are run. It is the intention of the proprietors, in the spring, to double the number of stamps and pans, and add another boiler. The engine is 40-horse power, and a hundred and twenty tons of rock is crushed in this mill weekly. It never has to stop on account of breakages, as is the case with the many less complete and substantial mills. It runs ten seven-foot pans. The neatness of the interior arrangements are only equaled by those outside. The premises are finely graded and laid out, and the retort house, company's office, etc., are all models of neatness and good workmanship. Taking it altogether, it is a model mill, and as it should be, it is paying its proprietors very satisfactorily for their enterprise. It is running at present on Gould & Curry rock.</p><p>Bullion Company's Works.</p><p>We also took a look at the splendid steam hoisting works of the Bullion Company—a very costly institution; useful as well as ornamental. Their shaft is three hundred feet deep, but I understand they have no ledge as yet. They show plenty of taxable property above the ground, but it would be a sin to tax the mine also, or rather the shaft.</p><p>Morton's Cider.</p><p>The best thing we struck in Virginia, was Morton's cider mill, on B street, where we were given unrestricted liberty to ""pitch in and help ourselves."" We had cider ""till you can't rest."" It is a healthy, delicious drink, and reminded us of the time, in years past, when we used to suck the article through a straw, thrust into the ""spile hole"" of a barrel, in our old home away ""down East."" Suck-cess to Morton and his cider. If the people of Virginia would drink more of that cider and less rot-gut, it would improve the health and morals of the community very materially, until in course of time society there would become as quiet and peaceable as that of Como.</p><p>Como Mill.</p><p>Our mill here has been running pretty well for the past week, having to stop occasionally to adjust some of the minor details, but to-day it commenced to run regularly. They crushed twenty tons of rock from Orizaba No. 2, last week, which yielded over $20 to the ton. This turned out much better than was anticipated, as much of it was surface rock, and none of it selected, but taken at random from the dump. The shaft is only some fifty feet in depth. The mill is now running on rock form the Red Del Monte, and will crush Monte Christo rock next. The Shiloh, Montezuma, Live Oak, Wagram, Chicago, Savage, Palmyra Consolidated, and other good claims, will all contribute in turn.</p><p>Our Paper.</p><p>We are to have a local newspaper, as you are aware. It will of course be devoted to the interests of this district, as well as to the mining and general public interests at large, and will be a desirable paper for our flourishing town.</p><p>Building Finished.</p><p>Goldbaum & Co. have just finished a fine, two-story building, which is called the ""Bank Exchange."" The lower part contains a billiard saloon and a store, and the upper part is a fine hall for dances, public meetings, etc.</p><p>The Union and the Constitution.</p><p>The sudden change in the tactics of the VIRGINIA DAILY UNION, in regard to the Constitution, has created considerable talk among us—many censuring it, while others contend that its views are perfectly sound, and that the best policy under the existing circumstances is by all means to defeat the Constitution. I sincerely believe that it will be defeated; yet I cannot but feel a pang of regret that such a good Constitution as that is should be rejected by the people, and defeated just because of the blundering folly of the framers of it, in putting that clause into it—taxing the mines. They ought to have foreseen that it would combine the loyal mining interest, as well as the copperheads, against it. There were ten sound-headed men in the Convention who voted against that clause, and they showed much wisdom in so doing. Seven wise men saved Sodom, but ten wise men couldn't save that Constitution. The majority voted them down, and that delectable majority may just thank their own stupidity if the Constitution is defeated. One good result will follow its defeat: It will tell the General Government, in unmistakable terms, that we don't want our mines taxed—at least until they are developed, and can stand taxation.</p><p>Good Men for Office.</p><p>But still, that Constitution may be adopted; and in view of that contingency, we must endeavor to elect good men to fill the various State offices, and especially for members of the legislature.

DU16,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, January 16, 1864.</p><p>Our Mills and the Mines.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--All goes well in Como. Our mill is now running steadily, regularly, and well, both night and day, and will soon be producing those glistening ""bricks"" of which I have so often written in anticipation. It is running at present on Monte Cristo rock, which yielded in the little prospecting battery attached to the mill, sixty dollars to the ton. When they clean up I will tell you how the big batteries make it turn out. It is, most undoubtedly, a rich claim, but we have many others in the district which are as good, and, perhaps, better than that. A large number of our ledges are being vigorously prospected, and several are taking out fine ore for milling. The old Shiloh is now showing out its true worth, in the shape of plenty of ore which shows for itself on the dump. The shaft is over one hundred feet in depth, and the ledge is a very firm, sound one, of four and a half feet in thickness. It has been a small ledge thus far, but is increasing; and when the water level shall be reached, will probably be much thicker and very rich. But in making mention of the ledges about Como, I would not wish to neglect those around our little sister town of Palmyra, which are no-ways inferior to those of the balance of the district. The Union, Orizaba, Rappahannock and Occidental are taking out splendid ore, and their shaft houses and hoisting arrangements are of an excellent order. The Odd Fellow, on the Crittenden and Banks ledges, is also classed among the best, as well as the Chicago, War Eagle, and several others. Near us, too, in the Indian Springs District, among the choicest claims we have the Minerva, Prima Donna, White Point, Virginia, and others, to say nothing of the rich and far-famed Whitman ledge.</p><p>The Constitution.</p><p>As a matter of course, just at the present time, the all-absorbing topic of discussion, aside from the mines, is that delectable Constitution, which on Tuesday next is to be voted upon by us, individually and collectively. Strong are the arguments for and against it, but those who argue in its favor, constitute a very weak minority now, and what few may possibly go for it, are of the extremely dogmatical order who don't like to change their ideas after having once expressed them, even though they may afterwards clearly see that they are in the wrong. They like to ""stick to it,"" like the man who, in a certain horse case, swore in Court that the horse in question was ""sixteen feet high,"" and, on being reminded of his error, still stuck to it; declaring that if he had really sworn that the horse was sixteen feet high, ""be d--d if he wasn't so."" They class all who are against the Constitution as ""Copperheads,"" utterly ignoring the fact that among their own ranks are several prominent Secessionists. ""Birds of a feather,"" &c. If they will train in such company, they can. ""Of two evils, choose the least."" Secessionists for, and Copperheads against, the Constitution. Then too, all those who were of the Constitutional Convention say they will go for it, on the principle of harmony, although ten of them voted and did all they could against that mining taxation clause. Assuming that they were sincere in their ideas, and really meant what they said and did at that time, believing that they were acting for the best interest of their constituents—the people—how dare they now turn round, and vote for that which they condemned as unjust, and declared to be wrong. Can they conscientiously do it? Will they do it? Brother miners, watch each one of those ten, who in the Convention stood up for your rights, and if they now repudiate you and your rights, mark them well, and remember them. Consistency is a jewel.</p><p>Last evening Messrs. De Long, Fitch and A. B. Paul, were here, and addressed a grand mass meeting of the citizens of this District. The spacious hall in the National Hotel was crowded to overflowing, and the eloquent speeches of Fitch and DeLong, as well as the good sound statistical sense of Paul, were listened to eagerly, and received with thunders of applause. They were talking to the bone and sinew of the community; men who could understand and fully appreciate what they had to say. The hard-fisted, hopeful, prospecting and hard-working miners were there. Fitch called for the ""ayes"" and ""noes"" on the Constitution question. The small dogmatical minority, feebly shouted ""aye,"" which was immediately drowned and forgotten, in the grand and almost unanimous shout of ""NO"" that followed it, and expressed the true sense of the meeting, which finally adjourned, after giving three hearty cheers for the ""Old Flag."" During the past week big spread eagle posters have announced to the public that Edgerton, Larrowe and Worthington were coming here, and would address a ""grand mass meeting"" of our citizens this evening, in favor of the Constitution; but it is now long past midnight, and they haven't yet arrived. So that mass meeting proves a grand fizzle. Will, they may as well just stay away. They would bring their pigs to a poor market. It's not worth their while coming up here for the slim prospect of votes they would get. They, and all the others who are longing for office under the new Constitution, meet with no sympathy among us miners. So, they want to tax our undeveloped mines to support them in office, do they? A jolly idea! It may be fun for them, but it's death to us, and we have come to the conclusion that the ""fun won't pay for the powder."" Every cent we can rake and scrape now has to go for grub and assessments, and we can't keep even at that. The idea of grinding money out of us to support a lot of office seekers is altogether out of the question, if we know ourselves, and we think we do. It certainly is much to our advantage to remain as we are—a Territory. As a matter of patriotism, it is our duty to do so; and what we would have to give to support a State Government, we can give to the sanitary fund, if we please. It is   quite possible that Uncle Sam may take a notion to tax these mines. Of that we prefer to run the risk; and, even if he should conclude to do so, in order to assist in paying the expenses of putting down the rebellion, well and good; it will eventually accrue to our benefit. But the mines will not be taxed. In two or three years from now, there will be hundreds of well developed, paying mines in this Territory, and from the proceeds of them, a princely revenue can be obtained, sufficient to support a State Government on as grand a scale as we may desire, and have plenty left for Uncle Sam besides. So, let us wait till then, and be contented with the good and sufficient free government under which we are now getting along so prosperously. Let us ""let well enough alone.""

DU17,"<p>LETTER FROM COMO.</p><p>COMO, February 11th, 1864.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--There is no longer a doubt, but it is a matter of fact, that the mines of Palmyra and Indian Spring Districts, are A No. 1. Many are the difficulties which we have undergone to prove the stability of our wealth. During 1860, (at the time of our first excitement,) the barbarous red-skins over-powered our feeble band of miners, and until a little more than a year ago these places were nearly abandoned. But since that time, some few, who felt sanguine that the mines here were good, have returned. They failed however to get capital with which to operate, as capitalists felt unwilling to invest until the mines were opened. Yet, with much toil and hardships, they have succeeded in demonstrating to a certainty that the mines here, if prospected well, ""will do to bet on."" Another drawback to us was the fact of our being too near the wealthy mines of Virginia and Gold Hill, and possessing different mines from those of Reese River. Our ledges are not exceedingly rich on top, and it requires depth to develop their riches; but ragged, hard-working miners, without a ""red,"" have proven the fact that our ledges are large and well defined, and contain the precious metals in abundance; and the eye, without the aid of a glass, can daily feast upon the gold and silver being revealed. Capitalists now begin to see this, although no wild excitement prevails. We are gradually and surely ascending the steps of wealth, built upon solid rocks; (we wish we could now say ""bricks,"" but patiently we will wait.) Our foundation is strong, and we rise, not to fall.</p><p>""A. D.,"" your correspondent, who has so often described the merits of these Districts, and well too, has of late seemed to be seared by a spell, and looks with amazement as rich rock is brought in from the various claims, and exclaims, ""is that so?"" His pen is rusting, and, like the mass, his pick is brightening; his fortune is hid; he seeks it; do not disturb him, for when he finds it you will hear from him.</p><p>Turning our attention towards the ledges we find the Whitman, Constitution, White Point, Montgomery and Rappahannock, which are the mother ledges of the District. They are large and well defined, and, when prospected, prove themselves to contain gold and silver. The Whitman is of immense size. Thousands of tons can be taken from its croppings which will pay from $50 to $100 per ton, judging from what we hear and see. The Constitution ledge is large, and traceable for three miles. The indications have a great resemblance to the ""far-famed"" Comstock. Only one test has yet been made of the Constitution ledge. About twenty-five feet deep is the lowest depth to which this ledge has been prospected. At this depth the miner invariably finds water and blue casing, and, quartz full of sulphurets. It is, beyond doubt, a rich ledge. The White Point, a late location, is not flattering on top; but it has been pronounced, by a gentleman from South America, to resemble the rich mines of that country. Some of the assays have been good. It contains no base metal.</p><p>The Montgomery ledge is good, though capital is required to work it. Water is found at the depth of sixty feet. The Rappahannock ledge is not so large as the others, but makes up in richness for what it loses in size. Many other ledges deserve a description, and it only requires capital to bring out their ""hidden treasures."" Of late capitalists have been investing in most of these ledges, and pay rock is fast wending its way to the sunny rays of this beautiful winter.</p><p>Our mill, though silent now, will soon be heard clattering with double speed, making up for lost time, and those who are acquainted with our mines will not have lost confidence in them for the mills' idleness, for it was not because the rock did not pay, though no first class rock was crushed. We predict lively times here this spring, which you will probably hear of through our paper, which is soon to be started. We understand that a project for another mill is under way. It is useless for me to give you an account of the rich assays we have had of late, for an excitement here is impossible. We shall only rise from a ""firm basis""—silver bricks—which must, will, and shall be produced. A paper, mills, toll-roads, gas, (as we have good coal mines near by,) water companies, race tracks, and public improvements of every description, especially ""bricks,"" are all ""only a question of time.""

DU18,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, Feb. 12, 1864.</p><p>The Como Mill, and why it Stopped.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--Como still continues rolling on, and takes the rest of the world along with it; but things have not gone exactly to suit us of late. We had indulged in great expectations of being able to tell you lots in regard to the big yield of our ledges here, under the stamps of the new mill; but just about the time we got ready to toot our horn, the aforesaid mill stopped running—just naturally and surreptitiously ""dried up""—and it still continues in that same unhappy condition up to the present date. Yea, verily, ""now is the winter of our discontent."" But what made the mill stop? I noticed an article in the UNION of the 10th inst., in which a difficulty is spoken of as existing between the mill owners and Mr. Mette, the superintendent, and the cause of the present stoppage attributed to that. Being pretty well posted in regard to the affair, I will tell you what I know, in simple justice to all parties. When the mill first arrived here, we received it was a grand flourish of base-drum and fife, and destruction of lager. We said, ""bully for the mill, we're all right now,"" and laying down our shovels and picks, just quietly waited for the completion of the mill which was to grind out our eternal fortunes. But as that happy period approached, Mr. Mette began to look about him rather anxiously for rock to crush. We told him not to fret, we had millions of it, rich as cheese, and enough to keep his rattle trap going through all future ages. Mette thought that all very fine; in fact, so fine that he ""couldn't see it.""  He told us the mill would be ready to crush our rock before we had any on hand worth crushing. But, bah! We told him our ledges were all rich, and would pay from the surface down. In due time the mill was finished, and we supplied him plentifully with our fine surface rock. The whistle sounded—</p><p>Smash went the stamps, round went the pans—</p><p>""Were ever folks so glad.""</p><p>We all felt jolly. We consumed much lager on the auspicious occasion, and the Como Brewery ""stood the draft"" gallantly. We saw our rock going through the mill with the most contented satisfaction. We felt already rich. But in a few days ""a change came o'er the spirit of our dream."" Our surface rock didn't pay as we expected it to do. Mette said: ""I told you so!"" We 'saw the point,' then. We agitatedly looked about us for the rich rock wherewith to feed the craving battery. Good ledges were all around us, but could our shallow prospecting holes and shafts be called ""mines?"" Even the Monte Cristo failed to give the big results which were anticipated, although it paid well considering that the shaft was only twenty-five feet in depth. Limited quantities of rich rock from some of the deep shafts were produced, but not a mine in the district was in condition and prepared to supply the mill regularly. Therefore, in view of all these things, the fires went down, the steam dried up, and the Superintendent allowed the mill to cool off for a week or two; it having run just long enough to try some of our rock and prove to us that our mines will pay well. We think we are ready now, and able to supply that mill with all the rock it can smash forevermore; and we shall do so, whenever it starts up again.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mill changes hands. That is to say, certain parties have leased it, and yesterday took an inventory of everything connected therewith, preparatory to starting it again in a few days.</p><p>I have endeavored to show that it was our fault, and not that of the mill, that it had to stop for the present. And now, in regard to the Superintendent, Mr. Mette: As the present state of affairs has given rise to various reports of a nature calculated to work injury and throw blame where it is hardly deserved, I will endeavor to correct the error, in simple justice to Mr. Mette, and try to ""render unto Caesar that which belongs to Caesar.""</p><p>This mill is owned by an incorporated Company in San Francisco, composed of men who, it appears, hold the almighty dollar in high esteem, and who never part with it from their reluctant grasp without giving the eagle a severe squeeze, and then straining their eyes to see where it goes to. From the commencement of the mill down to the present time they have subjected all the acts and doings of the Superintendent to the severest scrutiny, often finding fault where justly none should be found, and, by withholding the necessary funds at times, have cramped and impeded his operations. When the mill stopped, they concluded Mr. Mette must be altogether to blame, and accordingly sent a committee of three up here to investigate the matter, composed of men whose experience in milling affairs seems very limited, and who evidently know more about coffee mills than they do about quartz mills. They came; and judiciously, according to their own idea, finding what fault they could, reported accordingly. Of course Mette received from headquarters letters full of censure; in fact some of them really quite insulting; and he, as an upright business man, conscious of having performed his duty faithfully, to the best interests of the Company at all times, properly resented it. He immediately invited a committee of five of our most responsible business men to examine into his affairs generally, and they, being men of sound judgment and experience in such matters, found everything all correct and as it should be on the part of Mr. Mette; but they also found, by means of the accounts, and the letters which he had received from headquarters, how meanly he had been dealt with. He had conducted everything on the most economical scale, in order to suit his employers, and they in return, on their side, used towards him the most rigid and illiberal economy, amounting in many instances to miserly parsimony. But then, you know, it is said that ""a corporation has no soul,"" which is certainly true in this case at least. Mr. Mette has also been accused of waste, by disappointed parties here, in town, and the ""tailings"" of the mill were reported to be very rich. The San Francisco committee of investigation found a loss in the quicksilver of half a pound to each ton of the rock crushed, which all mill men will say is less than the average; and Mr. Beliard, of this town, a gentleman of great experience in mining matters, tested a quantity of the tailings, at the request of Mr. Mette, and found but a mere trifle of the precious metal. Considering the newness of the mill, and the inexperience of all parties in the working of the rock of this district, so little waste is really surprising. Excuse me for occupying so much of your space on this subject; but the stoppage of this mill is prejudicial to all concerned, and the public should know the true reasons. I believe in justice. ""Give the Devil his due."" Two more mills are contracted for and are coming here soon. One, of forty stamps, is coming for the Whitman mine, and the other is to be moved over here from Grass Valley, Cal.</p><p>Other Items.</p><p>Many strangers are coming here every day, and we are improving fast—having dog fights, man fights and religious exercises every Sunday. We hope soon to arrive at the dignity and importance of a ""man for breakfast."" Como will be heard of yet. And then, too, we are to have a newspaper—a weekly. The money is raised and the press and materials sent for. J. A. Andrews has been appointed constable for this district, and commenced the duties of his office by the arrest of old ""Pap"" Huse for assault and battery. We have considerable business in the law line, before Justice T. W. Penney, so that the Constable finds some employment. Mr. Andrews makes an efficient officer.</p><p>The great Amazon tunnel, which is to tap the best ledges of this district at a great depth, is now commenced and will be pushed forward with energy. It will be amply large, and is designed for a single track, with the necessary switches. The Amazon ledge, belonging to the company, is a fine one, well developed, and from six to ten feet thick. It assays rich, and the tunnel will tap it 400 feet below the surface. Very rich ore, within the last few days, has come out of the Rappahannock, and also from the Monte Cristo. One could hardly ask anything richer. A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU18.jpg,daily-union
DU19,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, February 20, 1864.</p><p>Our Mills and the Mines.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--Our new mill, after a nice little rest of a few days, is about to take a fresh start, and this next week will commence crushing rock from the Whitman Ledge. Fine quartz is now being hauled from there, and from it great results are anticipated, for the Whitman is rich beyond a doubt, large quantities of the rock having been thoroughly tested in other mills, enough to convince any one that it must pay the biggest kind. The management of the mill has passed into entirely new hands, J. B. Winters, Esq., being now the Superintendent, and Mr. L. Soloman will have charge of the amalgamating department. Mr. Solomon is a gentleman whose great practical experience in the amalgamating and assaying line highly qualifies him for this important position, and a more judicious choice could hardly have been made. His assay office, here in town, will still continue in full operation, in the immediate charge of his son, a highly intelligent young man, fully competent to the task, who will continue assaying on the same reasonable terms as before. Outsiders seemed to be under the delusion that the stoppage of this mill would operate as a sort of damper upon our prospects, but that was a great mistake for things were never so lively here as at present; lost of strangers are coming in every day, and all tell us that the fame of Palmyra District is spread far and wide, and that the next ""big rush"" will be made to this locality. And most assuredly this must be the case, just as surely as water will run down hill, for we have the mines here, and good ones too, as recent developments have amply proved. As we sink on our big, well defined ledges, we find the ore richer, until—like the Rappahannock for instance—we find ore that would make even the Gould & Curry grow black with envy. A few days ago the Monte Cristo showed ore very rich, being of the best kind of sulphurets; considerable of an excitement was created thereat, and feet in the Monte Cristo are now in demand at high figures. The shaft of the Shiloh is now down to a depth of 120 feet, and, under the energetic superintendence of G. A. Brier, Esq., the work is being vigorously prosecuted. The ledge is now seven feet between the walls, and composed principally of a peculiar soft, porous, gray quartz, which, on being subjected to the roasting process, produces fine globules of silver in abundance. It is rather unpromising looking rock, but it is ""like a singed cat, better than it looks."" The Shiloh has always assayed well—as high as four and six hundred dollars to the ton—but speaking of assays reminds me of the big assay which Mr. Solomon got from an ordinary looking piece of the Whitman rock, day before yesterday, of $3,131 53 to the ton. If it will only crush one tenth part of that, under the stamps, it will not be ""bad to take."" The Amazon Tunnel, under the efficient management of Mr. Weston, is driving ahead, and is sure to be one of the future ""big things"" of the district. It will tap many of our best ledges a thousand feet deep, and cannot fail to be a good paying enterprise; all who own feet in it have their fortune secured. A few weeks ago a company was organized here, and went out to prospect the famous Desert District. They saw the elephant, played with his tusks, and came home a day or two ago, wiser if not richer men. They don't want any feet in Desert District. They made a location, but don't intend going back to work it. They don't wish to discourage any man who feels disposed to be an enterprising cuss, but all who go there, or to Reese, will be apt to come to the conclusion that charity begins at home and that they haven't bettered themselves by going to Desert.</p><p>A while ago I made mention of the beneficial effects which the lager of the Como Brewery was having in promoting an increase in our population, and I now have to tell you that within the last few days the entire brewery is discovered to be posted directly on top of one of the finest kind of ledges, of as rich looking quartz as one might wish to see. The ledge is ""blind,"" not appearing on the surface at all, but is now found running directly through the cellar where the beer is kept. It may not have been the remarkable qualities of the beer which produced this ledge, but there certainly was no such ledge known of before the brewery was placed there. It is called the Lager Beer ledge, and the Whitman Company are sinking a fine shaft, in order to prospect the ledge fully.</p><p>Miscellaneous.</p><p>The Como Fusiliers, a fine military company organized here in town, drill regularly under the command of Capt. C. A. Witherell, lately of the army of Gen Rosecrans. Fort Churchill will never again be called upon to protect us from the rascally Pi-Utes. We are fully able to protect ourselves. We ask no odds of anybody. We read that the Alabama, with the Southern Confederacy on board, is coming with a big fleet to desolate this side of the Continent. Let them come on! They'll have a jolly time of it. They must wade through blood. They may blow up Fort Alcatraz; they may bombard  and destroy San Francisco; they may take Sacramento; they may take Carson, and destroy the hall where the Constitutional Convention met—but does it follow that Como can be taken? Well, we reckon not; not till the last armed Fusilier expires!</p><p>I told you in my last letter that we are going to have a newspaper started here soon. The press and materials are already shipped, and will shortly be here. It will be a first class paper, ably conducted, and the job printing department will be second to none in the territory. But you will hear more of it when it comes. Town lots are I good demand, at reasonable prices, and notwithstanding the difficulties we have to contend with in the way of scarcity of lumber, new buildings are continually going up. Como was commenced right, is being built up right; and will be the model city of the Territory. But what is the Territorial Legislature about? They are talking of indiscriminately taxing the mines. Well, they hadn't better do that, it won't work. They must have some regard for the opinion of the public on that point, so emphatically expressed at the late election. They must be crazy. Yea, verily, ""they whom the Gods would destroy, they first make mad."" And such demented legislation as that will have the effect of causing a disruption of the Capital. It will sooner or later have to be removed from Carson to Como, where the balmy breezes among the waving pines, and the pure mountain air, may cleanse and purify the legislative brain, so that they may at length be able to appreciate, see, and consult more fully the best interests of our rich and thriving young Territory.

DU20,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE</p><p>Como, March 18, 1864.</p><p>The Weather.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--We are having a storm here to-day, by way of variety, and we have needed it, for it has been one unvarying round of naught but sunny skies, and spring breezes, which in the course of a few years might become, perhaps, monotonous. For days and weeks together, the fresh spicy breezes have gently wafted themselves to us from the purple distance of the lovely valley of Walker river, loitering, ever and anon, in their winding way along the mountain sides, to play among the evergreen boughs of the groves of waving pines. Ah ! why could not such lovely weather last always. But then the all-wise Creator has ordained that with the human race, ""variety is the spice of life,"" he has accordingly seen fit to give us fair and indifferent weather by turns and promiscuously. Thrice welcome are these storms, for the springs are getting very, very low, and we want more mills. Blessed be the storms of the snow and rain, for they are very efficient for laying the alkali dust of the plains, and without them the eternal sage-brush would wither, pine away and die. But, ""sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,"" and, although the present drouth in California and in this Territory may continue, and the present season may prove the driest ever before known, yet we'll rejoice and be jolly over the good supply which we yet have on hand, and trust in the Lord for more.</p><p>The Mill and the Mines.</p><p>Our mill has kept up an incessant thumping and grinding of the far famed Whitman rock, since it started, until yesterday, when it stopped, and the first clean up, under the present management, was had. It has probably turned out very well, but how well, will be known in due time. The most prominent mines are now all being worked, and sinking down into the bowels of the ledges is the order of the day. Loafers are few in Como. They are ""played out."" We are all at work, and earnestly bent on proving to you of Virginia that our mines are fully as good as yours. You have rather got the start of us; that's so; but we shall catch up with you in time. We do not expect any sort of a Reese River rush here, for we are too near home for that. Our mines must come up in the public estimation on their own merits alone. Many strangers have appeared among us of late, and most of those who come here stay; but still their number is quite few in comparison with those who are now emigrating to the far-off country of thin rich ledges and enhanced distances—Reese River. Hundreds are every day leaving California, with their trunks packed and marked for ""Reese River;"" not once dreaming that perhaps they may find better mines nearer home. And onward they rush, looking neither to the right nor the left; but as they come over the snowy summits of the Sierras, far away in the blue distance they seem to see their land of promise gleaming brightly in their deluded imaginations, with big streaks of silver and gold. Well, bless them, let them go, and when their golden dream is passed, and they return weary and disappointed, we will show them better ledges here, and a thousand fold better advantages for working them, than ever existed at Reese River.</p><p>Fatal Accident to John Otto.</p><p>Last Monday morning, John Otto, otherwise known as ""Capt. John,"" was accidentally killed in the shaft of the Emblem. He had let off a blast, and in venturing down too soon, it is supposed that he became suffocated by the smoke or foul air, and fell out of the rope in which he was slung. He fell about fifteen feet. When taken out he was alive and could speak; but his skull was badly fractured, and he was otherwise seriously injured, so that he died in half an hour. He was a native of Pennsylvania, and aged about forty-three years. Although he worked hard every day, wielding the pick, he used to be a man of note in public life in California, and figured in 1854 as the clown in Lee & Bennett's Circus. He was a good gymnast, and figured in the bills as ""a fellow of infinite jest."" He was at one time reputed to be worth some thirty or forty thousand dollars, but gradually he became reduced in circumstances until we find him here, swinging the pick for a livelihood; and at last, he whose gymnastic exploits and grotesque witticisms excited the admiration of thousands, now lies a mangled corpse. We have buried him in our little graveyard, where the evergreen pines stand sentry around him, and the fresh breezes of spring, sweeping through the sage-brush round the rugged sides of Mount Lincoln, are singing the miner's requiem. In a narrow shaft, in his last ""claim,"" John Otto, and his troubles and trials, repose forever.</p><p>----""He was a miner;</p><p>Let his faults be buried in his tomb.""</p><p>The Amazon Tunnel.</p><p>The Amazon Tunnel, of which I have spoken in my former letters, which will tap many of our richest ledges at a great depth, is very steadily driven forward, night and day, by two shifts of hands, under the efficient management of Mr. Weston, the superintendent. The tunnel is a splendid one, and is in now fifty feet; it will probably strike the ledge belonging to the company in about 80 feet further. This may turn out very good, for the croppings assay $60 to the ton, and it is a large ledge. A fine substantial car is now building, which will be placed on track in the tunnel. Stockholders in the Amazon Tunnel can rest assured that everything goes well. The treasury is in a healthy state, the work is progressing energetically, and the scheme itself is one of the ""good things"" of the district. I speak impartially in regard to it, for I don't own any in it, although I expect to be able to trade somebody out of a few feet of it, one of these days.</p><p>The Rappahannock and Union.</p><p>The Rappahannock continues to yield lots of rich ore. It is a very rich mine, and I understand that steam hoisting works are soon to be erected over the shaft. As soon as the ledge was found to be rich, the claims near it tried hard to prove it to be a portion of their claim, but were unable to do it, and never will. The Union Company, on the same ledge, is also being worked, and a large double working shaft is being commenced, which will strike the ledge at a great depth, when it must undoubtedly prove very rich.</p><p>Amusements—St. Patrick's Day.</p><p>The inhabitants of Como are as much given to mirth and joy as ever, as the frequent dancing parties and evening raids to our little sister town of Palmyra, lately, can well attest. Mr. Terrill and his omnibus are always at the service of the ladies on such occasions, and he gallantly transports them to Palmyra and back, in a highly efficient manner, free of cost. St. Patrick's Day was celebrated, yesterday, in grand style. Several of the sons of ""the green isle of Erin,"" got pretty tight. In fact it will take a day or two longer for them to get sober clear through. At noon we fired three or four dozen guns in honor of the day, which was done by means of anvils, placed one on top of the other, with powder confined between, and fired by means of a train and a hot iron rod. During the afternoon the Como brass band paraded the streets in their splendid band wagon, drawn by a fine team of blooded stock, belonging to Alexander Korn, Esq., of this town, and by him kindly loaned for the occasion. These fine animals were tastefully decorated with spangled nettings and plumes, and, together with the band wagon, were, indeed, a fine turn out. The band played many soul-stirring national airs, and in return were treated to much lemonade. The festivities of the day wound up with a grand ball at Cross' Hotel, which it is impossible to beat, anywhere. The music was by the Como quadrille band, consisting of four pieces, of rare talent, and great equanimity. The attendance was full, and the ladies all wore their prettiest dresses, and sweetest smiles. It is useless for me to try to describe the ""gay and festive scene,"" or the glorious supper. I can't do justice to it. This ball was for the benefit and in aid of the ""Como Sentinel,"" the newspaper about to be started here, and netted quite a handsome sum toward the enterprise, as the ladies furnished the supper free, and the band played free of charge, for which they have the individual thanks of</p><p>A.

Yea, verily, we were particularly jolly. And why shouldn't we feel jubilant? Mr. Abraham, editor of the coming paper, the Como Sentinel, arrived the evening before, and brought us the good news that the press, printing materials, and all the little details necessary for the establishment, was then in Dayton, and would be here on the morrow. At 8 o'clock next morning a telegram announced that the teams had left for Como, with their important freight. Passers on the road, arriving at various times, reported to us the progress of the teams, and we accordingly made preparations to receive them in good style. After dinner the Como Brass Band turned out in full force, and with the glorious old star spangled banner floating from their splendid band wagon, paraded the streets, all the fine animals of the team being gaily decked out with elegant nettings and lovely plumes. The rich martial streams of music swelled upon the balmy air, as this hilarious turnout moved towards Palmyra, on its way down the road, to meet the coming press. Just in the lower suburbs of the promiscuously thriving town of Palmyra, we met the teams coming with the press and materials on board. The teamsters gazed with projecting eyes at their escort, it being an arrangement that they had hardly expected to meet in this sage brush Territory, and came to a halt, but immediately became assured that our intentions were peaceful and salubrious on a bottle of cocktails being produced, which we had thoughtfully brought along from Martin's saloon, foreseeing their exhausted condition. To their kind inquiries as to our heath, we answered ""jolly,"" and when they asked us if we could ""stand the press,"" we bade them ""press on."" Arnbold, too, of Palmyra, seemed willing to ""stand the press,"" as well as the drinks, for he would have us all stop at his house and lemonade all round. The mules, also, of the press team were all treated to a drink of water from the big spring, and the procession moved on up through Palmyra, towards Como, escorted by the music, playing many a lively air, the strains of which reached the ears of the miners toiling in the shafts and tunnels on either side, who immediately dropped their picks and, with loud cheers at the passing train, evacuated the premises and struck out for Como to see the fun out. As the plumes of the leaders of the band team appeared over the divide, entering Como, the two big anvil batteries, which were in readiness at either end of the town, commenced banging away at a tremendous rate.  Billy Bartle and his able assistant, Bill Davis, worked the upper battery, and Capt. Donald Ross commanded the lower battery. Madly rushed the excited artillerymen, and bang ! bang ! thundered the bounding anvils, each battery striving to outdo the other, and forcibly reminding us of the famous battle between the Monitor and Merrimac. It was a regular ""anvil chorus"" and no mistake, and much powder was destroyed thereby. The train moved down through Main street and up Fifth Avenue to the printing office, with the band playing the soul-stirring airs of ""Hail Columbia"" and ""Yankee Doodle,"" amid the hearty cheers of the citizens; and so now that long expected press is safely here, and in due course of time you will see the product of it in the shape of the Como Sentinel, a weekly paper, which will be devoted to the mining and public interests generally, and although not a political paper it will endorse the present Administration. Our town is only some eight months old, but still the rapid increase of population, business, etc., has so soon required the establishment of a newspaper here.</p><p>Our mill is still pounding away on Whitman rock, and from present indications we shall soon have one or two others in course of erection, for the value and permanency of the mines of this district is placed beyond a doubt. In fact, if Palmyra District was only situated about two hundred miles out in the midst of the great desert basin, instead of being so near home, the rush hither would be wonderful to contemplate, and it would speedily assume the reputation of being the very richest scrap of country in the known world.

DU22,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, March 31, 1864.</p><p>The First Clean-up from Whitman Rock.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: The last clean-up of our mill was made apparent yesterday, in the shape of a comfortable sack full on crude bullion, weighing, in all, 1,068 ounces. Mr. Solomon being sick, it was not melted and assayed here, but sent per Langton's express to the headquarters of the Whitman Company, at San Francisco, for further doings thereon. This splendid yield of bullion proves beyond a doubt the immense richness of the Whitman mine, and places it side by side at once with your far-famed Comstock. It must also be borne in mind that these are the returns from crushing nothing but the actual croppings of the Whitman, not being taken from any shaft or tunnel, and if the surface rock pays so well, how will it pay at the depth of a few hundred feet? In fact, if no better ore is ever discovered than these croppings show, it is a good thing enough, for there is plenty of it standing at the surface of the ground—enough to keep a hundred stamp mill crushing steadily for a hundred years.</p><p>A Visit to the Mines.</p><p>A few days ago I paid this Whitman ledge a visit, for the purpose of satisfying myself in regard to the present and future prospects of the thing. I was hauled out there on a big quartz wagon, propelled by six long-eared mules, commanded by a gentleman whom I think a heap of. At the diggings—for I hardly know whether it would be proper to call it a ""mine"" or not, as yet—I found some seventeen honest miners, under the direction of J. Turner, Esq., the Superintendent, doing a highly promiscuous amount of work, in the way of tumbling and smashing big masses of rock from the croppings, taking down small forty foot banks of earth which happened in the way, wheeling wheel barrows, drilling holes, and a small train of cars carried unlimited quantities of waste material over the dump. All this, however, is only preliminary, and these honest miners are merely a skirmishing party which Mr. Turner has thrown out, preparatory to a grand attack upon the mine itself. He showed me the richest streak which he has discovered as yet, and it is his intention to follow the aforesaid streak, [halfway] down into the bowels of the world, in operations of illimitable extent. Being a practical miner myself, I heartily indorse the soundness of the idea. The Whitman ledge is the Comstock of this vicinity, and is creating considerable excitement among those who appreciate good feet. But it must be recollected that although the Whitman is the only lead satisfactorily tested thus far, we have numerous others aspiring to favorable consideration. The Rappahannock, for instance, shows ore now which is undoubtedly very rich, and just as good as the best average ore you can scare up in your favored locality. It is taken out at the water level and there is lots of it; and when the hoisting works are erected on the mine, and the thing properly got at, rich results are sure. The Rappahannock is involved in litigation at present, which impedes operations somewhat, but all will be right in the end. The Union Company, the first on the extension south same ledge, is sinking a big double shaft which will strike it about 200 feet deep. Stock in the Union is up in the market, as it should be in the heart of every loyal man. In response to the kind invitation of the gentlemanly superintendent of the Buckeye Tunnel, I went in and took a look at that underground institution, a day or two ago. The tunnel is 686 feet in length; it has already tapped two good ledges; when they strike their Mammoth ledge, which they will tap at the depth of nearly or quite 300 feet, it will turn out one of the richest things of the district. The Montezuma also is sinking a big double shaft which will develop unmistakably rich ore, for the croppings are of the richest in the district, if assays can be at all relied upon, and future developments will show the Montezuma to be only second if not equal or superior to the Whitman. It is a very valuable mine. Be it understood that in this district we do not deal in ""wild cat"" for the simple reason that we have plenty of good, substantial ledges without.</p><p>Miscellaneous.</p><p>A Board of Brokers was organized here a few evenings ago, and will soon be in operation. It is called the ""Como Miners' Stock Board,"" and tremendous operations in the ""feet"" hue may be looked for in due course of time, if not sooner.</p><p>Como still marches onward in improvement, like a jackass wades into a box of barley, and ""every day brings something new"" in the shape of progress. Alexander Horn, Esq., so long and favorably known to the town of Palmyra as the storekeeper thereof, has become imbued with the idea that Como is to be the Virginia of this district, and he has accordingly left Palmyra recklessly to its fate, and carted all his ""plunder"" up to Como, where he has opened a fine stock of goods in the shape of towels, cheese, hats, whisky, dried apples, jack-knives and tobacco. He is a lovely young man, and the ladies all admire him. Alex. may be mistaken in his idea of evacuating the town of Palmyra, however, for that town also is bound to go ahead in due course of time, same as Gold Hill does. It is in a good situation, and the heavy springs at that point are already taken up and claimed for milling purposes. The Rappahannock and other rich mines thereabouts must erect mills there, and although the population is small, at present, it must inevitably increase, for they drink the Como lager there exclusively. The place is bound to thrive. A. D.</p><p>P. S. Mr. Turner has just come in from the Whitman, and brought with him pieces of the ore which would do stockholders, or ""any other man's"" eyes good to look at. Native gold and wire silver is plainly visible to the naked eye, amid the richest kind of black sulphurets. He sends it to San Francisco to-day, per express, that the stockholders therein may wax jolly over their prospects. There is plenty more where that came from. A.

DU23,"<p>LETTER FROM PALMYRA.</p><p>COMO, April 5th, 1864.</p><p>Our Mill Resting.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION:--Our mill is at present resting for a few days, until a goodly quantity of ore shall be transported hither from the Whitman mine, sufficient to give it a good start, and keep the stamps busy for a long time to come. In the last long run which this mall had, nothing could surpass the perfection of its working. J. B. Winters, Esq., the superintendent thereof, pronounces it a perfect gem of a mill, not to be beat by anything of its size, and he being a miller of long experience and good repute, his opinion is entitled to much favorable consideration. The Rhode Island mill at Gold Hill may possibly surpass it in some points, but few others can even equal it. The builder of it took great pains with it, and spared no expense in the faithful execution of every portion of the work, in the most substantial and perfect manner. He lost considerable by his contract, but he has shown what he can do in case he should be called upon to build another. He has certainly ""got his name up""—some thirty feet high—for at about that elevation, in a conspicuous place in the interior of the mill, in gilded letters, on a little tin sign, announce the following legend: J. S. Akin, Builder, 1863.</p><p>The Buckeye Strikes Their Ledge.</p><p>The Buckeye Tunnel, of which I spoke in my last, has, since fifteen minutes past ten A. M. on Saturday, assumed quite an important position in the stock market from the fact that on that momentous occasion a very rich ledge became revealed to the gaze of the happy stockholders therein, and the ore is pronounced by all good judges to be very rich indeed. The size of the vein is not ascertained, but soon will be, for this tunnel is one of the few undertakings in this district which have thus far been successfully carried out. And it has only been by steady and industrious application of labor and limited capital. The tunnel is nearly 700 feet in length, and a stream of water runs from it fully sufficient to supply a first class steam mill. The grand trouble in this, as well as in all other districts, consists in the fact that everybody pays assessment on too great a number and variety of feet instead of concentrating their energies and little capital more upon one point. Such policy is ruinous to all who persists in following it, as well as retarding the development of taxable mines, which is the grand desideratum in view of our assuming a State Government.</p><p>The Como Sentinel</p><p>Will make its first appearance some time next week. It would have appeared sooner, only that in transporting the office over here from Petaluma, the types got most terribly mixed. In fact, a quiet individual belonging to the establishment, and whom they introduced to me as the ""devil"" thereof, privately informed me that they types were all converted into ""pie,"" which, after all, is not so bad, although rather a singular circumstance that: food for the mind being changed into food for the body. But this person tells me that it is bad, for the ""pie"" will have to be ""distributed""—among the poor miners probably –a charitable idea nevertheless, and not bad at all. I'll help him distribute a portion of it, if it's good. He says it's a ""devil of a job""—meaning, probably, a job for the ""devil.""</p><p>All Fools' Day.</p><p>""April Fool Day"" here was signalized by the usual amount of practical jokes. Numerous letters were received per Express, by various individuals, conveying them the important information that they were April Fools; and among the many other old tricks usual on such occasions, an antiquated hat, covering a big stone, was placed in a plausible position on the sidewalk, inviting the kicks of passers by. A certain attorney of this town did kick it, although he denies it strongly; but several of the boys, who saw him do it, say he did—as well as many others who didn't see him. One thing is certain; he didn't limp after kicking it, and no more he wouldn't if it had broke every toe on his foot. Later in the evening I saw the same attorney vainly wasting matches, one after the other, patiently endeavoring to light a candle which was ingeniously manufactures out of a potato. He, however, was not the only one who experimented with that candle, or that used a cake of soap made out of a potato in washing his hands. On that eventful day, also, one J. D. found a pocket book out in the street, which contained quite a windfall in the shape of a postage stamp, two buttons and a cambric needle. He says he found no other money in it, and we must believe him for, like George Washington, he ""will not, cannot tell a lie,"" although, unlike little G. W., he hasn't got any ""little hatchet.""</p><p>A.	D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU23.jpg,daily-union
DU24,"<p>LETTER FROM PALMYRA.</p><p>Como, April 13, 1864.</p><p>A.D. Growls.</p><p>Time rolls on apace, and so does Como. But as we thus roll on in the course of human events the thought sometimes suggests itself to me that we do not roll ahead fast enough. Perhaps I am too impatient and unwilling to await the slow but sure developments that Time brings about, and therefore am inclined to think that our mines here are not being developed fast enough. And in many instances I know I am correct, for although, to be sure, we have the Whitman and the Rappahannock, both of which are proven to be rich paying mines, yet we have many other fine large ledges, the surface rock from which is decidedly far better than the general surface rock of Gold Hill or Virginia, and no doubt when they shall have been sunk down upon as deep as in the mines of those older districts, will be found to be fully as rich, and even richer; yet ""that's what's the matter;"" we have innumerable shafts and tunnels, but very few of them are being driven forward with the energy that they should. We have just to ""go down"" on our ledges and try and develop them a little faster before we can ever expect to catch up with the older districts. Slowly but surely one ledge after the other is being found to be rich; that's so. But I only object to the slowness of the process. As I said before, perhaps I am a little too impatient. Don't know but I am.</p><p>Como.</p><p>As far as beauty of location, good surroundings, plenty of pure water, abundance of wood, fine, sociable, well conditioned society and all sorts of general advantages are concerned, Como is a town which cannot be beaten anywhere in this thriving Territory. We are never subject to the ""blues,"" but endeavor to jog along as philosophically jolly as possible. On any reasonable pretext whatever the Como brass band is ever ready to turn out ""in style,"" and enliven the free mountain air with the glorious strains of ""Hail Columbia"" and ""Yankee Doodle,"" or the ""Sage-Brush Serenaders"" will nocturnally insist on disturbing the midnight slumbers of the fair sex with their romantic and seductive warblings. We have a prodigious amount of musical talent here, for a small city, and in great variety, too; from an irrepressible fifer to a magical performer on a big bass drum and pair of cymbals, which he does all at one lick, very seldom losing his identity, notwithstanding the great amount of noise he produces.</p><p>Schools, and-so-forth.</p><p>We have a fine, flourishing day school of twenty-five scholars, who, under competent tuition, are ascending the ladder of learning at a brisk pace. One Sunday school and Bible class, too, I can vouch for, from personal inspection, as being in a highly thrifty state, with plenty of good books in the library, and good teachers to show the members, both little and big, how to be religiously happy.</p><p>Cross's National Hotel still remains in the same comfortable condition as of yore, furnishing ""entertainment for both man and beast."" A. D. boards there, and is getting fat, like the rest of those who partake of the good things there to be found. That brewery, the Como Brewery, still continues to produce that immortal nectar in the way of lager, of which the iniquitous ""Mark Twain"" was so evidently enamored during his visit here, a short time ago. Poor fellow ! he attempted many times to go out and inspect the mines, that he might report upon them, but humbly acknowledges that he could never ""get past the brewery,"" where he sat and drank ""gallons and gallons."" He did succeed, however, in visiting the Whitman mine, which lies in the opposite direction from the brewery.</p><p>Whisky, and Copperhead Soldiers.</p><p>Whisky drinking is getting more and more unpopular, especially since the 1st of this month, when the price was raised to two bits a drink; but ""spiritual manifestations"" are still to be seen, in the shape of a small ""knock down and drag out."" Lieutenant Vanderhoof is here, enlisting all the copperheads he can find. He says they are the very men he wants, and that they make fine soldiers; which is an argument in favor of their ""soundness on the goose."" Singular circumstance, however.</p><p>The Doctor and his Box.</p><p>We have several notional geniuses here, not the least of whom is a certain N. D. who can never be persuaded to sleep in anything but a box which he got up himself. In the daytime it is made to fold one part over the other in a mysterious manner, so that it forms a sort of bench to sit on; but at night it lies spread open, and is wide enough for two, in case of matrimonial investment on the part of the Doctor. That coffin-like bed also serves to remind the Doctor of his latter end and last resting place. There he lies and cogitates, when not asleep, like as Diogenes used to sit in his tub and philosophize. And there, night after night, he dies in the arms of Morpheus, to be resurrected next morning by the sound of the mill whistle, which, however unlike Gabriel's horn, calls both saints, sinners and doctors, not to repentance, but to work or to breakfast.</p><p>A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing.</p><p>Cross, too, in his bar-room of the National, cannot sleep in anything but his desk, where he files himself away among the rest of his papers, night after night. First a pulu mattress document, then a sheet, then Cross, then another sheet, then a big cover, or envelope of wolf skin, and there he lies, both eyes shut and mouth gently opened; the picture of innocence; a veritable sheep in wolf's clothing. Around the middle of this precious package, A. D. ties an imaginary string of red tape, and labels it thus:</p><p>Hic jacet Cross;</p><p>Requiescat in pace.</p><p>Valedictory.</p><p>The Como Sentinel will publish its first issue the last of this week, and will hereafter keep the public posted in regard to Palmyra District, probably more fully than A. D. has done; therefore, with this letter our correspondence will probably cease.</p><p>During the past eight months it has been a pleasure to me to correspond regularly with the UNION from here, and it is not without a feeling of sorrow that I now bid you adieu. But you will still hear from me, through the columns of the Como Sentinel, whose affections I shall gently woo, on the principle that charity begins at home.</p><p>Your friend, A.

DU25,"<p>LETTER FROM PALMYRA.</p><p>Como, July 17, 1864</p><p>VIRGINA DAILY UNION: Thinking perhaps a letter from your old correspondent would be acceptable, I write you the little news within my reach. Within the last three months, times here in common with all the rest of the Territory, have changed, and Como has had to share in the general depression. Stocks in the rich claims on your far-famed Comstock have gone down way below zero, and just in the same ratio have all the other good ""feet"" gone down. Perhaps the end is not yet, but it certainly can't be far off, there being little room for any further depression. We never yet have arrived at that Elysian state of affairs known as ""flush times"" in this district, but, on the contrary, of late the ""circulating medium"" has become so utterly stagnant that a man with five dollars in his pocket is looked upon as a heavy capitalist, and twenty dollar gold pieces are only spoken of by the ""oldest inhabitants"" as among the things of the past.</p><p>The consequence of the aforesaid stringency in money matters is, that several of our whisky mills have had to quit running, not being able to credit their fellow-citizens for any more ""tangle leg."" Our quartz mill has been running by fits and starts, like a balky mustang, prospecting rock from various claims, with generally good results, but it is now again lying idle, waiting for something to ""turn up."" I am informed that negotiations are being entered into whereby it will again be started in a few days, permanently. This is as it should be, for that is too valuable a mill to be kept still while there is rock in the district that will pay. We have many good ledges which are in process of development by means of big shafts and long tunnels, which, at heavy expense, are going after the pay ore at a great depth, and this fall our mill must be grinding out the bullion from some of them, for it is there.</p><p>The Dayton Company, on the Montgomery ledge, have their new double working shaft now down to a depth of about 100 feet, and under the present efficient superintendence, the work is being energetically prosecuted. The ledge will be struck within 200 feet, and at that depth good pay ore will be found, for at the present depth a quantity of the rock has been crushed at the mill which yielded $20 to the ton. The Altamonte Company, on the constitution ledge, are also driving their tunnel vigorously forward, and it is now in about 460 feet. The Amazon tunnel is 180 feet in length, and will soon cut the first ledge of the series which this tunnel will penetrate. Near the Amazon, a New York company have also a series of good ledges, which will be cut by means of a tunnel at the depth of from five to eight hundred feet. This company is composed of men who are possessed of the greenbacks in goodly quantity, so that nothing will be lacking on the score of capital, to speedily make it a highly successful and paying institution. The Rappahannock Company are sinking the largest shaft in the district, which is now down to a depth of 100 feet, and it will be 200 feet before they strike the ledge. At 180 feet in their old incline they struck ore last winter which is unmistakably rich, and preparations are accordingly being made to work the claim in a thorough systematic manner. This noted ledge is one of the best, if not the best in the district. The Union Company—first south of the extension—are also sinking a new working shaft, which is now 117 feet in depth, and a splendid piece of work, very neatly and thoroughly timbered. This claim is just as good as that of the Rappahannock Company, and has the advantage of a perfectly safe and good property.</p><p>Notwithstanding the hard times, J. D. Cross, the popular landlord of the National, continues to take in strangers and provide for them in his usual handsome style, and no one who has ever partaken of his hospitalities will dispute that ""he can keep a hotel."" The Como brewery, too, still continues to produce that same perfect article of lager which so captivated and engaged the attention of ""Mark Twain,"" when he was over here, and the remarkable qualities of which, if better known abroad, would be more fully appreciated, and bring it into free use in every well regulated family.</p><p>Our newspaper, the Como Sentinel, on account of the presence of hard times, thought it best to move to Dayton. I sincerely hope it may be pecuniarily benefitted by the change, and it may have been good policy removing thither, but, whether so or not, time will tell. Dayton, just now, has the advantage in being the County Seat; but just let a goodly flow of greenbacks set in toward Como, and we can easily discount the County Seat, in the way of prosperity. ""So mote it be."" ""We may be happy yet."" A. D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU25.jpg,daily-union
DU26,"<p>LETTER FROM PALMYRA.</p><p>Como, July 28, 1864</p><p>VIRGINA DAILY UNION:--You are not to suppose that because times are a little hard with us, and greenbacks scarce, that the people of Como have given up to the general spirit of depression, and settled themselves into a fit of the blues. That's not the case by any means, but, on the contrary, we endeavor to ""keep a stiff upper lip,"" and smiling countenance, gathering numerous crumbs of comfort from the fact that we are no worse off than our neighbors.</p><p>C. A. Witherell, Esq., who has just returned from a trip to the Silver Mountain country, whither he went seeking for a chance to better his condition, reports things there fully as dull as here; very little doing anywhere; no money lying about loose; in fact, he came to the conclusion that he could get along as well in Como as he could anywhere that he went, and as far as future prospects are concerned, this district had decidedly the advantage. The only places where there appeared to be much going on in the way of improvement, was at a little place called Silver King, where there had been a saw mill recently erected, and twenty-eight houses just built, but only four of which were occupied as yet. The intention was to build a few more houses and quit.</p><p>We have very little to note in the way of improvement here in Como, although of course something is done in that line every day, people generally seeming to be inclined to arrange things comfortably for the present, and wait patiently for ""the good time coming"" to arrive. Mr. H. B. Hammer has just finished his fine drug store on Main street, and furnished it in the most complete manner. A better selected stock of goods cannot be found in the Territory. He has everything that is ever likely to be required here in his line, from balsam copaiva to cherry pectoral, and from a quill toothpick to a nursing bottle. The telegraph office also has just been removed into the drug store. In looking around at the vast array of patent medicines and potent drugs displayed on Mr. Hammer's shelves, one is naturally led to the firm conviction that it is the easiest thing in the world to regulate the health of the entire community to a perfect nicety, so that any one can be sick or well just as it suits them, with such a drug store in their midst. He has a specific cure for every known disease or ailment human flesh is heir to; also, all varieties of poisons, enabling one to choose their own style of death—together with specific antidotes for each and every one of them, in case one should change their mind after imbibing a poisonous draught. There will be no more deaths in Como, except by suicide or accident, unless, indeed, some fool growls himself to death over the idea of ""hard times,"" or works himself into such a painful condition of sore-headedness over imaginary slights that his crabbedly jealous disposition won't allow of his living in peace with his fellow man, but that all jokes directed towards his own immaculate self are intended as an earnest insult, which, sooner than endure for a moment, he would rather growl himself into the last stage of pusillanimous imbecility. To all such I would recommend marriage and the daily use of a gallon of beer from the Como brewery.</p><p>We have been anxiously and closely watching the action of the Convention assembled at Carson to frame a Constitution for our proposed new State of Nevada, and incline to the opinion that they are about perfecting a Constitution that will be accepted by the masses of the people in this Territory. The article on the Judiciary, as also that on Taxation, commend themselves to the approbation of all who have the true interests of the country at heart. Copperheads are not expected to fancy the true loyal sentiments of that Constitution; not that I wish to class any one as a Copperhead who don't happen to view things in the same light that I do—but all true Union men cannot fail to respond to those sentiments. The indiscriminate taxation of the mines was the rock on which the other Constitution split. That rock has been carefully avoided this time, and the Legislature will be left to decide as to whether the net or the gross proceeds of the mine shall be taxed. This is as it should be. Our last Legislature would insist on taxing the mines, but we'll try and put competent men into the next Legislature.</p><p>Prominent among the claims being actively worked here now is the Monte Cristo—lying within the town limits and one of the claims in the district which may be classed as A No. 1. It shows a wide, well-defined ledge, in portions of the surface of which gold is distinctly visible to the naked eye. It is owned mostly by Frenchmen, and the work on it is being carried forward with great energy, both night and day, running two shifts. They are sinking a new double shaft, five by ten feet, which will strike the ledge at the depth of two hundred feet. It is now sixty-five feet deep, and is to be thoroughly planked from top to bottom. The shaft of the Como company is now forty-one and a half feet deep, and a drift is run from the bottom thereof thirty feet due east. It is a fine piece of workmanship, and the indications are splendid. The shaft of the National is now down to the depth of twenty-nine and a half feet, blasting through solid ledge all the way. They have now struck a strong vein of water, which promises to be a valuable acquisition. Mr. Cross, the Superintendent, informs me that, with the present arrangements, they cannot go much deeper, but it is his intention to erect hoisting works soon. The rock at the bottom is of an excellent quality, and a piece of it shown to me yesterday, by the efficient foreman, Mr. Nason, was filled with splendid sulphurets.</p><p>Since the Indian difficulty, which we had in May last, the Pi-Utes have kept away from about here entirely, but within the last few days several have arrived from the Sink of the Carson, and are now encamped on the hill opposite town, with their squaws, papooses, &c. The Indian who was shot at the time of the difficulty of which I speak, was badly wounded, the thigh bone being shattered. He was brought into town, where he received every care and attention that humanity could dictate, and several of his brother Indians attended him, but he was shortly removed by them to Walker river, where he died some four days ago.

DU27,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, Sept 3, 1864.</p><p>Things in General.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: Summer having passed on in its usual course to join with the numerous bright summers of the past, and the chilly blasts and snows of next winter being only a few weeks in perspective, we are naturally inclined at this time to take a cursory view of our prospects, and endeavor to judge, from the experience of the past, what the future may be. A year ago all was life and animation here. Prospecting for rich silver mines in the numerous fine ledges was everywhere being vigorously carried on, and every day some new discovery or development in the way of ""splendid looking rock"" or most encouraging ""indications"" was exciting the public mind. The taking up of claims and incorporating companies to work them under fine sounding and auspicious titles was all the rage and no one felt satisfied until he had obtained by trading or actual purchase, a few feet in some one or the other of these claims which he had become convinced was an ""almighty good thing,"" and one of the claims which was to make him independently rich, and transform all his splendid future plans and fine castles in the air into living, tangible realities. The dream was glorious while it lasted; town property was held firmly at big and increasing prices, and the exhilarating sound of the busy hammer and saw was heard on all sides, hurrying up buildings to accommodate prospecting visitors, and the daily new accessions to our permanent population.</p><p>We are quiet enough now. Nobody wants any more ""feet;"" town property is low in the market; carpenters' tools are pretty rusty, and our population is not so heavy as it was. The prospecting visitors, and temporary portion of the community have moved on to other portions of the country, where they will tarry awhile with newly excited hopes and prospects, and again ""move on."" Prospecting is at a discount, as far as new discoveries are concerned, and the numerous pieces of mining stock, so prettily gotten up and upon whose face we were so anxious to see our name representing us as the fortunate proprietor of so many ""feet"" or ""shares"" in such and such a rich claim, are all carefully filed away for future reference and carried round in the pocket book no longer. None but some among the best or most prominent of our claims are being worked, but these are being operated with an energy and stability of purpose that must eventually prove successful in developing good paying mines; for all the assays and milling tests we have had thus far, tell us that our ledges are among the best in the country, and only require to be gone down on to a sufficient depth in order to develop rich paying ore. This we are bound to do, but the process is necessarily slow, greenbacks or anything else in the way of circulating medium being very, very limited in circulation here as elsewhere.</p><p>But our hopes are high as ever, and faith in our mines not abated at all. Our society is of the very best; sociable, happy and content, as circumstances will admit; so we shrug our shoulders at the past, and look forward with confidence to the future, feeling that we can weather the hard times and come out all bright when the spring of prosperity shall open over this embarrassed Territory once more.</p><p>Political.</p><p>We are going in strong for the new Constitution, and I predict that throughout the Territory the vote for it, and the adoption of a State government, will be carried by a larger majority than that by which it was refused last January. The political cauldron is seething and boiling fiercer and fiercer as election day approaches; the numerous candidates are out prospecting around among the voters, and all the prominent corners and door posts are disguised and beplastered with the announcing placards of the legion of aspiring candidates. Oh ! the long faces there will be after that eventful election day is over, and how the Salt River boat will be crowded. There will have to be extra boats put on the route this time, sure, for never before were there so many candidates in the field, in this county at least. Our County Union Central Committee—a set of droll cusses—put their mirthful heads together and with a facetiousness worthy of a better cause, concluded to put a grand practical joke upon their dear constituents—the people. So they would not allow the usual privilege of primary meetings, but told everybody that wanted office to pitch in and get it. Now, strange to say, there were several who, although they didn't want office at all, yet were willing to sacrifice themselves upon the altar of public interest, merely for the benefit of the dear people. So they all ""entered"" for a grand scrub sweepstakes race, and the consequence was, that in the next issue of the Sentinel came out a list of candidates as long as the moral law with the ten commandments tacked to the end of it. It was funny to see how many there were that thought themselves well qualified to fill the various offices, and to reflect upon the number that were fully as eligible and deserving, but whose natural modesty held them back from announcing their names in the paper or on big placards, as candidates for the Assembly, for Sheriff, for Recorder, and down to the smallest kind of a public office. And, now in order to highten the joke, the committee gleefully hook hands together, and concluded to call a convention to nominate a ticket for the people to vote for. So, feeling that the people were incapable of selecting their own delegates to represent them, they just appointed a lot, who of course held a very harmonious convention and did things up according to programme. But will this satisfy the people? Will Copperheads take advantage of such a jolly state of affairs or not? We can tell best about it after election. In a few weeks again, the Central Committee will have to act in relation to the election of officers to govern our new State, and will of course do as they did before and tell all aspirants to sail in. So, therefore, in order to be in season, and forestall several I know of in this town as well as elsewhere, I hereby announce myself as Independent Union Candidate for Governor.</p><p>A.

DU28,"<p>PALMYRA CORRESPONDENCE.</p><p>COMO, Sept 21, 1864.</p><p>Times in Como.</p><p>VIRGINIA DAILY UNION: Notwithstanding the pressure of hard times consequent upon the lamentable stringency of the circulating medium, we Comoites manage to retain our usual salubrity of spirits, and when occasions requires wax jolly and even festive over our present and future prospects; empty pockets not preventing our having dances, musical soirees and little social evening parties as usual, the cares of wealth troubling us but little. In regard to grub we are all right, for we have three butcher institutions all in full blast, and in their mad competition ""bearing"" mutton chops down to eight cents per pound; of this article we have an abundant supply for some time to come, as there are seventeen hundred fat sheep being herded in the hills near town. Of pine nuts, however, there is a great scarcity, the crop having almost entirely failed this season. What few there are will soon be ripening, but will probably fall into the hands of a few unprincipled monopolists, who will ""bull"" them up to famine prices.</p><p>A Mysterious Visitor.</p><p>An individual with a rosy proboscis and registering his name as James Martingale, from San Francisco, was here a few days ago, and although Sam. Nason and myself pumped and pried into his business all we could, we utterly failed to discover what he came here for. He wandered about all day, looking at the mining operations, and asking all sorts of questions with reference to the prospects, etc., and when he left he carried off a large sack full of pieces of quartz which he had collected from all the prominent claims. He seemed to be ""flush,"" for he showed plenty of money, but he was undoubtedly deranged, for he ordered chicken, oysters and wine for dinner. He was remonstrated with in a kindly manner, but he would have it. Next morning he offered a twenty dollar gold piece to pay his bill with, but not being able to change it, we just quietly seized it with the bill, and he left perfectly satisfied.</p><p>The Mines.</p><p>Our mines are still being actively prospected, and in a concentrated and systematic manner. The Dayton Company, on the Montgomery ledge, have their big shaft now down to the depth of 130 feet, and have just struck the outskirts of the ledge. They will, however, have to go down some 20 or 30 feet further before they get into the main ledge; they are now running in a mixture of quartz and porphyry, and the quartz shows very flattering indications of the close proximity of a rich ledge. May they realize all their most sanguine expectations! The Amazon Tunnel is also still being energetically driven ahead, and must sooner or later prove a most valuable investment to the fortunate shareholders, for it will strike the Walker, Montezuma, Shiloh, Sharon, and other ledges at a great depth, besides the immediate ledges belonging to the company. The shaft of the Monte Del Rey is 200 feet deep, and from the bottom of it they are drifting east and west to strike their ledge running both night and day with two sets of hands. Symonds & Buckley, on the old Goliah ledge, at the depth of 100 feet have struck a heavy stream of water; they have quit sinking and are trying to drift to their ledge, but so much water renders their progress exceedingly slow and difficult. The Comet Company, on the same ledge, have their big shaft still energetically going down, and they have struck some very fine looking rock.</p><p>Politics.</p><p>Since election politics has quietly simmered down, but still we are looking anxiously forward to the campaign now about opening, and will soon marshal our forces in the shape of a Lincoln and Johnson Club. The ""unterrified"" are also already organizing, for they hold a meeting for that purpose to-night. The results of the late election in all parts of the Territory was so unexpectedly favorable to them that they feel very confident of being able to carry their ends in the coming contest. In this, however, they will reckon without their host, for they will have to meet the Union forces aroused, united and ready for them. Lyon county went Union, notwithstanding the split which existed in the party at the late election. We will have no split this time. ""United we stand, divided we fall,"" and woe be to the man or men who shall in any wise cause a split in the ranks, for their traitorous heads will also get split by the outraged community. So mote it be.</p><p>A.	D.</p>",public://daily-union/DU28.jpg,daily-union

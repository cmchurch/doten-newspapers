Rock01,"<p>No. 1.</p><p>California Letter.</p><p>The following letter from a highly esteemed friend in California, we believe to contain a reliable statement of “matters and things in general,” in that State, together with other matters of interest to Plymouth people, at least. A residence of some five years in the “Land of Gold,” should enable him to form a pretty correct opinion of the “elephant” which he assures us, in a private note, he has positively seen:</p><p><em>Double Springs, Calaveras Co., Cal.,</em></p><p>June 4<sup>th</sup>, 1854.</p><p>DEAR &quot;ROCK:&quot; - In compliance with your request, I embrace the present opportunity of addressing you a short communication on the state of matters and things in general, and will try to give you an inkling of the doings at this end of sundown. </p><p>Well, in the first place, we will premise that you recollect, in “days lang syne,”one fine Sabbath morning, while the merry church bells were ringing, the good old bark “Yeoman,” weighed anchor, spread her sails to the breeze, and took her departure from that part of old Plymouth harbor known as the “Cowyard,” bound for a remote region in the far west, called California. On board was a gallant company of the sons of “Old Plymouth,” among whom was no less a personage that your humble servant. As we shaped our course out past the “Gurnet,” we thundered forth our last adieux from the mouths of two old rusty cannon, and as the good old town faded dim in the distance, many a swelling tear was dashed away, as we thought of those we left behind. Long months passed, away, and we arrived safely at the land of promise, and our hearts beats high with hope, as we thought that we would be returning to the “loved ones at home,” with our pockets well lined with that for which we came – the yellow, all-powerful gold. A few months passed quickly away, and our little band separated; each started his own way in the pursuit of fortune, and the good old bark which bore us safely here passed into the hands of strangers. Years have passed away since then, and now where are those who were once of the “Pilgrim Mining Company!” Still scattered; -some are at “home,” some at “Vallecito,” many are at “Shaw’s Flat,” (which place by the way appears to have a peculiar attraction for all of the California Plymotheans,) one is a “Mokelumne Hill,” and I am here. I often see my old companion and shipmate at &quot;Mokelumne Hill,&quot; and exchange news with him concerning our friends at home, and have a talk about our beloved &quot;Old Plymouth,&quot; and thanks to your kindness we are occasionally blessed with the &quot;Plymouth Rock.&quot; We greedily devour the home <em>news, </em>which is generally from four to six weeks <em>old, </em>when we get it, and as for the advertisements, I always read them through from beginning to end; for I can always tell more about the doings in town by them than by half a dozen letters. I tell you, Friend Rock, you folks at home don't half know how to prize an old newspaper. </p><p>In '49 Young California put on a pair of seven-league boots, and since then she has been striding ahead at a rate unparalleled in the history of the world. Young children - not the &quot;oldest inhabitants&quot; - remember when the now mighty city of San Francisco was the little Spanish village of &quot;Yerba Buena;&quot; and where now stand palatial buildings of marble and granite, once stood a few little dirty adobe houses. The green surf no longer rolls upon the white sandy beach of the cove of &quot;Yerba Buena;&quot; and where six years ago large ships swung at anchor, now stand splendid stores in the heart of the city, and beyond are buildings and long wharves extending far out into the bay. Five years ago, whale boats, launches , and 178 <em>The Journals of Alfred Doten: Book No.9 Spanish Gulch: 1854 </em>179 little outlandish droghers, after a long, perilous, and toilsome passage, of from two to ten days or more, up the rivers, landed their loads of the first victims of the gold fever at the little tent towns of Sacramento and Stockton; - where now splendid floating palaces, driven by steam, &quot;through by daylight,&quot; land their passengers at the noble cities of Sacramento and Stockton, Then, on the roads to the mines, all travelled on foot - each one with his bundle, blankets &amp;c., slung over his shoulder, sore footed and weary, trudged along the slightly beaten track; now, on fine, well worn roads, splendid &quot;Concord built&quot; coaches, with their passengers comfortably seated on velvet cushions, are whirled along as fast as the finest and best of horse-flesh can carry them. </p><p>All sorts of improvements have been introduced in mining; the days of the &quot;tin pan and sheath knife,&quot; are past and gone; the &quot;cradle&quot; is thrown aside, and the &quot;long tom&quot; is fast yielding to the &quot;sluice.&quot; This is the grand leveller; by it banks and whole hillsides are fast disappearing down the gulches, creeks and rivers, and the old cradle &quot;tailings&quot; of '49 are considered among the richest of the auriferous soil. The rivers are dammed and turned, and by hundreds of long miles of canals, flumes and ditches, the water is brought into elevated flats, arroyas, and places where water never was seen except during the heaviest rains. A mountain is no protection at all to a gold deposit. If a big hill is suspected of containing any sort of a justifiable quantity of the &quot;root of all evil,&quot; a few shrewd miners put their heads together, and directly immense excavations are made, enormous tunnels are run in and deep shafts are sunk. In all &quot;hill diggings&quot; many make their &quot;piles,&quot; but where one makes a fortune fifty get &quot;flat broke,&quot; owing to the expense incurred. Many are of the opinion that the mines are on the decline, and will soon be &quot;worked out,&quot; and exhausted; but it is a <em>&quot;quien sabe case.&quot; </em>I think it a moral impossibility to exhaust them, either in your day or mine. New placers are daily discovered, and the old diggings, by means of the allpowerful sluice. . . are being washed over again with great profit. The &quot;cream,&quot; certainly, has been skimmed off, and a &quot;green one,&quot; just into the mines, stands rather of a poor chance even of making a living, unless he hires out. </p><p>I presume you have seen by the late newspapers that the new filibuster “Republic of Sonora” like Joel Shag’s camphene engine, has “busted and blowed up,” and the last remnants of this filibustering tribe, together with Col. Walker, their quondam “president,” have come crawling back, with their fails between their legs, and have surrendered themselves into the hands of Uncle Sam – preferring to be punished by him for their misdeeds to being longer exposed to the awakened vengeance of the outraged Mexicans. They were indeed fortunate to escape with their lives, which would have been but a just forfeit for their many crimes and outrages on the poor inhabitants of Lower California. </p><p>We have been visited with an unusual quantity of thunder storms lately; the “poor Indian” shaked his head and lays it all to the presence of the pale-faced “Americano,” who has introduced this extra quantity of thunder among the rest of his improvements.</p><p>I won’t bore you any longer just now, but will try and communicate with you again soon; so for the present <em>adios.</em> CALIFORNIA. </p>",public://rock/Rock01.jpg
Rock02,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />Spanish Gulsh. Calaveras Co.,<br />July 20, 1854.<br />No. 2.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Again I salute you, and will try and &quot;post you up&quot; in regard to the doings in these parts. The Fourth of July, &quot;the ever glorious fourth,&quot; has come, and gone; and as usual in California, it was celebrated by a most unusual amount of powder burning, cracker-popping, horse racing, whiskey-drinking, patriotism, and (where the case seemed to demand it,) a small &quot;tussle &quot; or so. Early in the morning, just as the first suspicion of day began to steal over the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra, we were all aroused from our slumbers by the thunder of a big, hollow oak log, which had the night before been charged heavily with powder, and tightly wadded, and tamped up solid with old shirts, sand, old boots, and shoes, and &quot;several other articles too numerous to mention,&quot; and it was agreed that the first one awake in the morning was to have the honor of doing the &quot;artillery.&quot; Juan Fernandez (not the original Juan Fernandez, but a namesake,) a native of Hindostan, - having probably laid awake the majority of the night, watching the eastern sky, was the successful &quot;hombre&quot;: he hastened out, applied a coal of fire to the fuse, and retiring to a safe distance, awaited the success of the application. Fizz-z-zwhang! bang! roar! thunder!! and instantly the air was filled with a perfect shower of old boots, shoes &amp;c. and fragments of the &quot;artillery,&quot; which of course was blown into &quot;tarnal flinders.&quot; All hands on the gulsh were of course awake at once, and such a firing of revolvers, rifles, and shot-guns, and popping of crackers, never was heard in &quot;these diggings&quot; before, that's certain. Some of the boys had made a raise of an old American ensign, which was in the Mexican war, so we elevated it on a long chapparal stick, and to the music of an old cracked fife, and a big, tin coffee-pot, by way of a drum, we escorted the &quot;stars and stripes&quot; up and down the gulsh, all of us &quot;armed and equipped,&quot; as the occasion seemed to require. In front of each cabin we stopped, played &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; and fired a &quot;few de joie,&quot; in honor of the day; and after going the rounds of all the camps, we dispersed quietly to our breakfasts. The day was very warm and the thermometer at noon stood at from 110 to 115 degrees in the shade. </p><p>Some of the boys went out and shot a lot of quails, hares, and rabbits, and had a game dinner. I went with several others up to &quot;Mokelumne Hill,&quot; to the great horse races which were to come off, but the weather was so intensely hot that they did not run until late in the afternoon. We didn't think much of the race, and therefore didn't stop long. On our way home we stopped at the &quot;Golden Gate&quot; ranch; here we found a lot more of our acquaintances, and with them a flute and violin, which music was put in immediate requisition, and dancing was the order of the evening. We had no ladies to grace the occasion, so ours was a &quot;stag dance&quot;; all sorts of steps were taken, from polkas and waltzes, down to the &quot;fore and after,&quot; and &quot;Juba,&quot; and &quot;merry feet were dancing&quot; until supper was announced, when we all sat down to the enjoyment of a most glorious repast, to which we did ample justice; after which, cigars, music and songs were introduced into the programme; each one sung his &quot;favorite song,&quot; and occasionally some one would step out and give a specimen of his abilities in the heel and toe line; one especially, a Scotchman, danced the &quot;Highland fling&quot; to perfection. Thus happily passed the evening, and about twelve o'clock we ceased our &quot;jollification,&quot; and wended our way, each one to his own camp. Let no &quot;old fogy,&quot; when he reads this, turn up his immaculate nose with a grim smile, at what he may term &quot;follies.&quot; Just let him be situated precisely as we are situated here, and then see how he would act. If he has any warm blood at all about his heart, he might easily do worse than we did. </p><p>Down in the big cities, as a matter of course to-day, a great noise was made and a big fuss was kicked up generally, numberless cannon were fired, and bushels of crackers were popped while the shipping displayed innumerable flags of every nation, color, shape, and pattern. In the evening balls were given in all parts of the country, and were all pretty fully attended, notwithstanding the high temperature of the atmosphere. So ends this fourth of July. I see by the papers that Messrs Bull, Crapeau, and Ottoman have taken their guns and gone out on a big hunt, after a lot of “Russian bears” that have been troubling their “turkey pen.” I presume they intend to give those aforesaid “bears” “jesse,” and learn them better manners in future, than to cut up such “foul” doings among the Turkeys.</p><p>River mining has commences, and many companies have got fairly into the beds of the rivers. The Mokelumne is much lower now than it was last year at this time, and mining in its bed commenced this year a month earlier than usual. – Most of the companies have gone to a great expense in the way of damming, fluming, cutting long races, putting in heavy pumps, &amp;c., and many of them in all probability, will lose time, labor, and money invested, while others will make fortunes. As for that matter, mining speculations here are nothing more or less than an extensive mode of gambling, and many a poor fellow has laid out all his hard earnings in purchasing a river claim, thinking he had “dead things” on making his “pile,” and at the end of the season found that he had lost all. Farming too, or “ranching,” as it is termed in this part of account of the soil, for that always yields bountifully, but the price of labor is high, transportation is high, and there is so much competition, that much produce is sold at cost, and in many cases at much less than cost; potatoes for instance. In the lower valleys potatoes yield enormously, and with little or no trouble or expense besides ploughing and planting; but last year so many were brought into market that it was overstocked, and many lost money on them, besides the transportation, so that others who had not yet dug their potatoes left them in the ground, as they could not afford to dig them. In the Passaro, Petaluma, Bodega, Santa Clara, and others of the lower valleys, potatoes could be had for the digging. Near Santa Clara one man had a large lot which cost him three hundred dollars for the digging alone, ready sacked for market, part of which he was obliged to sell at <em>eight cents</em> per sack of two bushels, and the remainder he offered to any one who would take them away, and leave him the sacks. He gave away as many as he could, and at last was obliged to go to the expense of hauling them away himself to get rid of them. Gardening in the neighborhood of the large towns and cities is profitable; the principal gardens have stands in town, which they keep constantly supplied with the earliest and freshest produce, and as they are so near market that their transportation costs them but a trifle, they make money at it. On some ranches the ground squirrels are very troublesome, making sad havoc among the vegetables, corn and young trees. They are very numerous, and the most effectual remedy yet found out for them is to poison them, which is done by means of strychnine. A quart of wheat is sweetened with a little molasses, and half an ounce of powdered strychnine is added. A table spoonful or less of this is placed at the mouth of their holes, and he who partakes of it is a doomed squirrel. In this (Calaveras) county the grasshoppers have been very troublesome this season; in some parts they have destroyed entire crops, the melon crop especially suffered. On one ranch near here was a fine large patch of onions about half grown, which the owner fondly hoped would escape; but lo! one fine morning a legion of grasshoppers commenced at one corner taking it clean as they went, even eating the roots, and in just seven days they destroyed the entire crop. The proprietor, however, paid them off well for it, for he set a lot of Indians at them, who with their squaws surrounded the patch, and driving them towards the middle, threw a lot of dry grass around and over them, which they set on fire, roasting them all alive, &quot;doing them brown,&quot; and cooking them all &quot;just right,&quot; for a lot of fine, fat grasshoppers roasted in this manner, is a dainty morsel to the Indians. No more at present - hear from me again by and by, so with many considerations, &amp;c. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>CALIFORNIA. </p>",public://rock/Rock02.jpg
Rock03,"<p>No. 3.</p><p>Letter from California.</p><p>Fort Grizzly, El Dorado Co. Cal.,</p><p>Dec. 12, 1854.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: </p><p>“Yet onward they passed on their weary way; now toiling up some steep ascent, and again descending to cross some rapid mountain torrent. The shades of evening found them among the tall and gloomy pines; here they made their camp.”</p><p>After quite a long silence, I again communicate with you. Since I wrote you last, I have, as you perceive, left my old “stomping ground” on the Spanish gulsh, “evacuated those premises,” and in company with two others, with all our household goods, traps, and furniture, packed on the backs of two horses, “emigrated” to this place, on the south fork of the Cosumnes river, where we arrived, after two days hard travelling, ever a rough and mountainous road. Since then, we have been busy getting our camp ready, and preparing for the winter, and are now snugly ensconsed in a good substantial log house, with provisions &amp;c., “laid in,” and are fully prepared to stand quite a wintry siege.</p><p>In the fall of 1850, a few hardy and daring adventurers ventured up thus high in the mountains, &quot;prospecting&quot; for &quot;new diggings,&quot; and finding here some pretty good &quot;prospects,&quot; they braved the deep wintry snow of this elevated region, and remained here that Winter; and as the Indians were somewhat hostile and troublesome, they built a small fort of logs and mud, for protection, and called it &quot;Fort Grizzly,&quot; from the fact that &quot;Grizzly Bears&quot; were right plenty about here at that time; since then the Indians have become peaceable, and the march of civilization has forced the &quot;Grizzlies&quot; to remove their haunts, up nearer the summits of the Sierra. They are still occasionally seen about these parts, hunting for acorns, but being rather of an unsociable disposition, “Grizzly” keeps as much as possible out of the way of white men, modern improvements, and rifle balls. The weather holds good as yet, and just at present, the winter rains seem no more likely to set in than they did last July. A few weeks ago, we had several showers, and many people thought the “rainy season” had set in, but no; that was rather too early; I think the rains will set in about Christmas. Considerable snow has fallen in the mountains just above here, which has had the effect to drive the deer down, and, as many hunting parties are out, the deer have to suffer. I shot two fine does, day before yesterday, near the camp, so just at present, we luxuriate on “venison.” Most miners are now in winter quarters, and anxiously waiting for the rains, to supply them with the necessary water. In all the principal “dry diggings,” water has been introduced from the rivers and creeks, by means of flumes, canals, and ditches, but all such water costs from fifty cents to a dollar, per inch, while rain water costs nothing; therefore many prefer waiting awhile, to paying from five to ten dollars, or more, per day for water, as they would have to do at present, and busy themselves throwing up dirt, preparing their sluices, digging races and ditches, and making all ready to “pitch in,” as soon as they have water. The overland emigration has stopped for this season, on account of the snow in the mountains; we are near the main southern emigrant road, and the last trains passed here a month ago; since then, the snow has fallen and some of the last trains from Missouri are detained in Carson Valley on the other side of the Sierra, as they are too late to get over the summit, they will have to winter there, and cross the mountain next season, after the snow melts, which will be from the first to the middle of June. Most of the trains that came in this season brought families, and in some of the wagons, or riding on horse back, sat blooming, pretty, bright-eyed, marriageable young damsels, the very sight of which would gladden the heart of an anchorite; of course all such arrivals are acceptable, and possess great interest in the eyes of the young &quot;bachelors&quot; with which California abounds. Women and children generally stand the journey across the plains better than the men, probably because they do not have so hard a time of it, not having to drive cattle or &quot;stand guard&quot; nights. An immense amount of sheep and cattle were brought across this season, and all the trains lost more or less of their stock; many lost from a third to a half of their cattle, and I saw one man, with his family, from Tennessee, coming in, working a yoke of <em>cows </em>in his team, having lost all his oxen except one yoke. &quot;Don't care,&quot; said he, &quot;as long as I get the old 'ooman and the young'uns through safe.&quot; Of those last, various sized boys were walking along ahead, while the girls rode in the wagon with the &quot;old 'ooman.&quot; </p><p>The morality among the cattle is owing to the bad water, reed, heat, dust, and fatigue of the route; in coming down the Humboldt, the water is very bad, containing a large proportion of alkali, so that there, and after getting to Carson river, large numbers of the cattle died. I know of several, who brought large droves of cattle across, who say they shall lose by the speculation. The Indians too, have been unusually troublesome this season on the plains, stealing cattle, cutting off stragglers &amp;c., and at Fort Larimie they have had a skirmish with a small detachment of U.S. troops, in which the Indians were victorious, and said that if “Uncle Sam” had any “better men” he had “better send them along.” If a few troops who were used to the Indian mode of fighting, were to be sent out along the emigrant route, I think it would cause the “red skins” to become a little more civil, and show them that “Uncle Sam” is not the “sardine” they take him to be; but to send out a lot of U.S. regular troops, thinking to fight the Indians in platoons, is sheer folly; a lot of California miners, “armed and equipped: as they saw fit, could whip a body four times their number, of the best Indians that ever had buckskin; for most miners understand the working of a “revolver,” and as for “rifle shots,” there are no better in the world than are to be found here in the mines; and like Indians, they would fight Indians with the advantage however of being able to whip them.  –The Chinese still swarm as plenty as ever in the mines; “birds of a feather,” they always “flock together;” but they are obliged thus to do, as they are prohibited from mining, in about all of the principal mining localities, and have to confine themselves to the river banks, aed diggings which the people do not think worth working; they are very industrious however, and often strike upon a place which a place which others have left, where they make good wages; after all, I think John Chinaman is as successful, or at any rate saves up about as much money, as the generality of the mining population; we don’t often hear of “big strikes” being made by them, for the very good reason that they never tell of it when they do find a “good lead.” These moon-eyed, long-tailed Celestials are indeed a &quot;peculiar people,&quot; and although they are of the &quot;nonresistant&quot; order as far as other people are concerned, yet occasionally the newspapers of this state contain accounts of fights among themselves in the mines, regular pitched battles sometimes. At Greenwood valley, last summer, they had quite a &quot;muss;&quot; several hundred of them pitched in and made a great noise and commotion, and several of them got hurt. </p><p>At Mariposa, and at Jackson too, &quot;big battles&quot; were to have come off, and all the blacksmiths in the vicinity were employed in making swords, pikes, spears and a sort of pruning hook or sickle which they attach to the end of a long string and throw it like a lasso; this is said to be very efficacious in extracting the heads of the enemy; but the authorities interfered and put a stop to the matter. These fights are generally imputed to differences, somewhat like that which at present agitates their native empire, but as I understand it, this is a great mistake. These quarrels are in some instances the result of local animosities at home, something like those we see between people of different towns, or sections of the older European countries, and even of our own. They occasionally arise from the feuds and quarrels of clans and families, some of which are ancient, honorable, and proud, like those of Scotland, although in California, these clans do not maintain any distinct organization, or generally manifest any more serious opposition, than the petty annoyances of individual intercourse. Sometimes these people, like our own, quarrel about their “claims,” and in one way or another, become “belligerent,” though after all, their warfare is rather of the windy kind, and its explosions are rarely mortal. Not a few of these fights are caused by their females, all, or nearly all of which are of the worst class, and also by squabbles originative in their gambling houses. Such, as I understand it, have been the causes of most of the fights among the Chinese in California. They are much like what have caused quarrels, crime, bloodshed, and murder, among the other populations of this state, and although “John Chinaman” will “gas” “blow” and quarrel, yet there quarrels are always among their own people, and trouble no one but themselves. But I have trespassed on your patience too long, already; my sheet is full, and as my subject may be getting rather dry, I’ll quit; so for the present, adios. CALIFORNIA. </p>",public://rock/Rock03.jpg
Rock04,"<p>No. 4<br />Fort Grizzly<br />Jan 1<sup>st</sup> 1855<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:</p><p>When I wrote you last, the weather, was for the season unusually dry and the want of the winters rains was beginning to be seriously felt throughout the mines and I was of the opinion that the rains would set in about Christmas, but no; the weather continued fine, and the sky cloudless; Christmas came and went and still no rain – the miners all wore long faces; business of all became dull; numerous bets of money were freely offered and taken that it would not rain before “new year’s day,” and as the old year drew near its close, big odds were offered, and few bets taken, against its raining, but human judgement, and even “yankee guessing” are liable to err sometimes, for yesterday morning, the last day of the year the sun rose behind thick heavy clouds, which overspread the blue sky; the wind was from the south east, the rainy quarter, and the freshening breeze, sighing and moaning among the tall pines, gave most unmistakable indications of a coming storm. At noon the wind still freshened, the long-wished for rain came pattering down, and during the afternoon and until twelve o’clock at night, alternate showers of rain, hail, and snow poured down merrily while the wind roared heavily among the bending tree tops, and though the old year was making a last effort, and striving lustily with his last breath to refute the foul slander of “no rain this year; the hands on the dial, soon told the hour of twelve, and “1854” passed out amid a perfect whirlwind of rain and hail. “1855” came in, young and strong; “a fresh hand at the bellows” and this morning found his “hard at it” bright and early, “knocking things right and left,” while the rain poured down in torrents. The storm still increased, the wind blew a furious gale, driving the sharp, cutting sleet, fiercely before it. Just after breakfast, a blast came fiercer and more furious than ever, bellowing and tearing fearfully among the tall trees, and shrieking among the pine tops as though a legion of demons were let lose; young ’55 was doing his there first; the thickening sleet, darkened the air; a large heavy pine tree was torn up by the roots and fell near our cabin, with a most tremendous crash; we could hear the trees falling on all sides, crashing down the mountain side shivering to splinters over rocky ledges; we heard more than fifty trees fall near by in the space of half an hour, making a noise resembling the report of heavy artillery. We saw one tall majestic pine, fall on a steep mountain side, and go sliding down for some hundred and fifty yards into the ravine below, the violence and ruggedness of its descent, stripping it of every limb, and leaving nothing but a long naked trunk, two hundred and sixty feet in length as I afterwards ascertained. The storm was absolutely terrific and appalling in its violence and I no longer wondered at the cause of so many enormous trees lying uprooted and decaying about this region. It reached its climax, and began to abate – “young ‘55” had “shook himself” and given us a specimen of his prowess on a first acquaintance. As evening approached the storm continued to subside. It is now night, a snowy mantle covers the earth, the elements are at peace, the winds are hushed, the bright stars twinkle in a cloudless sky, and the “lady moon” looks benignantly down upon the scene *note on next page. It will also have the effect to drive the deer, bear, and other game, down into the lower valleys for food. There they will find plenty of young and tender grass, which starts with the first fall showers, and no snow to trouble them, but there, they will also find themselves in the more thickly populated districts, and among plenty of good rifle shots – The deer are getting pretty well thinned out, to what they used to be, although they are yet numerous in some locations; the wintry snows drive them down to the plains and valleys, and in the summer as the snow melts, they retire back into the mountains, following up near the edge of the snow, and feeding upon the young grass. A young “grizzly” was killed about a mile from here a few days ago; he was a cub weighing nearly five hundred pounds. He was discovered drinking in a ravine by a squaw, belonging to a “rancheria” near by; she ran home and gave the alarm, and “bruin” soon found himself hemmed in on all sides by enemies and assailed with arrows in front and rea; he “showed fight,” but it was of no use, he stood no show at all, and in a short time he struck his colours and he surrendered overpowered by arrows and superior numbers. They took him to a town called “Indian Diggins,” some six miles below here, where the meat commanded a very ready sale. In less than an hour it was all sold, at twenty five cents per pound, for “grizzly” meat is very good eating, and being very fat, probably most of the “boys” went in for a little “hair oil” to straighten out their hair with Sundays. No more at present.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>California</p><p>Note:</p><p>This storm will supply the very driest portion of the diggings with plenty of the long-prayed for water. The shovel and pick will ring again, wielded by willing hands, the auriferous earth will again rush bounding through the long sluices, yielding up its glittering treasure, to reward and gladden the heart of the toiling miner, and business of all kinds will receive a fresh impetus.</p>",public://rock/Rock04.jpg
Rock05,"<p>No. 5.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort Grizzly, Feb. 22d. 1885.</p><p>&quot;Oh, why does the white man follow my path,</p><p>Like the hound on the Tiger's track,</p><p>Does the flush on my dark cheek, waken his wrath,</p><p>Does he covet the bow at my back?</p><p>He has rivers, and sees where the billows and breeze,</p><p>Bear riches for him alone;</p><p>And the sons of the wood, never plunge in the flood</p><p>Which the white man calls his own.</p><p>Then why should he come to the streams where none</p><p>But the red skin dare to swim,</p><p>Why, why should he wrong the hunter, one</p><p>Who never did harm to him.&quot; THE INDIAN HUNTER.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: - The above beautiful lines present to one's mind the picture of the &quot;noble savage,&quot; the &quot;Indian hunter,&quot; tall, straight, and athletic, with beads, paint, and feathers to match, contemplating with a jealous eye the encroachments of the &quot;paleface.&quot; In my school-boy days I have often read of the American Indians, and the Patagonians, of Tecumseh, and the Indian wars on the western frontier, and of Samoset, Massasoit, and others of the noble tribes whom our forefathers found when the Mayflower wafted them to their new home &quot;on the wild New England shore.&quot; The tall savage represented in the big picture in &quot;Pilgrim Hall&quot; was a familiar sight to me, and one memorable evening I went to &quot;Leyden Hall&quot; and saw some real &quot;live specimens&quot; of the North American Indians who were on exhibition there - &quot;admittance 12 1-2 cents,&quot; -and saw them &quot;smoke the pipe of peace,&quot; shoot the blow-gun, go through with the &quot;war dance,&quot; &quot;scalping scene&quot; and all, and like most others of limited information and experience, my ideas of Indians and the Indian character were in accordance with what I had read of and seen. But a person accustomed to such delineations of the &quot;red man&quot; as are to be found in some of the works of Cooper and in the history of King Philip, the proud chief of the Narragansetts, I think would be rather disappointed, as I was, by his actual experience of these Indians here in California, the &quot;Digger Indians,&quot; as they are called. Personal beauty is certainly not the chief characteristic of the &quot;digger,&quot; and for nobility of character and bravery he is not remarkable. He is of a muddy complexion, and, as regards color, certainly couldn't be classed among &quot;red men.&quot; A clumsy form, coarse features and a large head surmounted by a heavy mop of long, black, coarse, and matted hair, which generally hangs down about his dirty face or is tied up in a bob behind, are the sum total of his physical attributes. As regards dress, he is in no ways particular, any kind will do. Wearing apparel is considered rather of an innovation as yet, and its use is by no means universally adopted. When, however, a Digger Indian does so far conform with the usages of civilization as to adopt the use of clothing, he generally indulges in it to its fullest possible extent, not often purchasing his wardrobe, but begs or picks it up wherever he can, and never for a moment parts with any portion of it if he can help it, but wears it continuality, so that it is not uncommon to see a Digger with several shirts, coats and pairs of pants all adorning his person at the same time, and then if he can only make a raise of an old &quot;two story plug&quot; as a head-piece to surmount his other personal attractions, he feels as proud as a peacock, or like a darkey in a ruffled shirt. It is almost unnecessary to add that instances often occur where his entire wardrobe consists of a hat and a pair of socks, or nothing but a shirt. Those are an entirely superfluous article with him, and even when in all the glory of a &quot;full suit,&quot; he will not endure the idea of confining his feet in a pair of boots or shoes, but always goes barefoot, summer and winter, except when travelling in the snow hunting, when he wears moccasins, although I saw two Indians out hunting a short time ago, barefooted and traveling in snow knee deep. They are great beggars and never visit your camp without begging for shirts, pants , coats, sugar, bread, or whatever they happen to see that they want. Just feed a Digger once and he is sure to come again soon, and if he finds you an uncommonly benevolent individual in the feeding line, he will visit you often, especially about meal times, and perhaps bring his squaws with him. On the road to Volcano the other day, I met a little old dried up, monkey-faced, queer looking specimen of the genus &quot;Digger,&quot; strutting along in all the glory of a tall, glazed Mexican hat, with a large piece of red flannel tied about the crown of it, and no other article of dress except a pair of old striped pants. After the usual salutations were passed, he informed me, with a flourish of the aforesaid &quot;sombrero,&quot; that he was a <em>&quot;hi-oppo&quot; </em>(chief,) <em>&quot;big captain&quot; &quot;Captain Hal-luk-ky:&quot; </em>I told him I felt assured of his identity, and happy to have the honor of his acquaintance. The double-barrelled gun on my shoulder took his eye at once, and he urgently begged me to present it to him. I told him it was the only one I had, and regretted that I could not well afford to make him a present of it at once. He next endeavored to persuade me that I ought to take off my blue flannel shirt and give it to him, earnestly telling me that he was <em>&quot;big hi-oppo, Capitain Hal-luk-ky,&quot; </em>and &quot;no got <em>camisa&quot; </em>(shirt) . I told him that I fully appreciated his shirtless condition, but couldn't well spare mine. He then asked me for money, and tobacco, but not being overstocked with the former and not using the latter, I gave him an old pewter-handled jack-knife, which he received with much gratitude, being firmly impressed with the idea that the pewter handle was solid silver. We then separated, and the last I saw of &quot;Capitain Hal-luk-ky,&quot; he was standing in the middle of the road polishing the knife handle with his trowsers' leg, and probably debating in his mind how he should embellish his person with it in the most artistical manner; whether he should hang it about his neck, poke it through his nostrils, or suspend it by a bit of string to one of his ears. But I think we have had enough of Indians at present, so what more I have to write you about them, I'll reserve for a future letter. </p><p>The winter thus far has been unusually dry, and the times are much harder throughout the mines than they have been since '49. The winter of '50 was a &quot;dry Winter,&quot; but gold is not so easily found now as it was then, and the improved methods of washing out the gold require much more water than formerly, when the cradle or pan was as profitable as the sluice is now, therefore the lack of water is much more severely felt and the miners now see &quot;hard times&quot; indeed. A miner's credit is good at any of the stores when he is making money, but now the traders are obliged to close their books and refuse any more credit, many of them having sold goods so long on credit that they are unable longer to keep up their stock, owing to the lack of cash. </p><p>One trader at Volcano a few days ago showed me in his books where he had credited the miners thereabouts for provisions &amp;c to the amount of some four thousand dollars. Said he, &quot;It's all good, and I know the boys will pay me as soon as they can get water to work with; but my bills at San Francisco are pressing me now, and at this rate I shall soon be unable to meet them and consequently must close my business.&quot; Many other storekeepers are in the same &quot;fix,&quot; and the times are about as hard on them as on the miners. The storm of the first of January did but little good, supplying a few locations with a limited supply of water, and since then there has been no rains of much account. We have always had rains in the spring, but if these too should fail, the farming community also must suffer. But my letter waxeth long, so I'll draw it to a close. </p><p>In my former letters to you, I have written under the name of &quot;California,&quot; which I adopted as my &quot;nomme de plume,&quot; but a friend writing to me says I have no business with any such name - says I &quot;don't belong to California&quot; or &quot;California&quot; to me - that &quot;California is too much hackneyed already,&quot; and that I must sign my &quot;real&quot; name; so to please him I suppose I must. Therefore, friend Rock, humbly begging your pardon for having &quot;sailed under false colors,&quot; I remain with much esteem, Yours truly, BENBOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock05.jpg

Through the forest shades and over the sunny hills, with bow and arrow, the Indian hunter chased the nimble deer, or on the rapid mountain torrent, with his long light spear with its head of sharp, pointed bone, he speared the luscious salmon. Venison, fish, acorns, roots, grub-worms and grasshoppers were plenty and easily procured for food, the wild beasts furnished him with clothing, and the bark of the pine was a ready material for building his little wigwam; he lived a happy life and knew no care. But now, &quot;lo! the poor Indian,&quot; a change had indeed come o'er the spirit of his dream; the tall trees fall fast before the axes of the ever encroaching &quot;pale faces;&quot; towns and cities spring up rapidly in the very midst of his hunting grounds, and all the once clear and sparkling mountain streams are made thick and muddy by the incessant wash of the industrious miner. The long &quot;Kentucky rifle&quot; has thrown the bow and arrow entirely in the shade, and the poor Indian is now obliged to come down to manual labor, although it certainly goes very much against the grain.</p><p>Ever since the first settlement of America, ever since the landing of the Pilgrims, the Indians have been driven westward. Like &quot;poor Joe&quot; in Dickens' &quot;Bleak House,&quot; they have ever been ordered to &quot;move on.” Despoiled of their lands, they have “moved on,” step by step, on the weary trail, “moving on” towards the rocky mountains and the plains, and wide prairies of the far west. Now, from Oregon, California, and the other settles states of the Pacific coast, they are crowded back into the interior; slowly but surely, the race of the redman is fading away, “moving on” to be among the things that were; their destiny must be fulfilled, and a few centuries hence, the “Great Spirit,” will have called all his red children home to “the happy hunting grounds” where the pale-faced intruder never comes, and the order to “move on,” is never heard.</p><p>These Indians here in the mining region are generally of a quiet, inoffensive disposition, although on the frontier they are rather inclined to be unruly and troublesome as yet. They have a great aversion to labor; indeed a Digger Indian never works when he can possibly get along without it; he had always rather beg than work for his food; but when he happens to stand in need of a little money, he generally repairs with his squaw to the most convenient &quot;diggins&quot; and sets her to work digging and carrying dirt, while he sits in some comfortable place by the water and washes out the dirt in a pan as she brings it to him. As is generally the case among all Indian tribes, the women have to do all the hard work. In the fall of the year is the Digger's harvest; the large, sweet acorns are then ripe and, as they are a &quot;staple commodity,&quot; a large stock of them is collected and laid in for the winter. They are prepared for eating by being first beaten in stone mortars into a sort of meal, which is boiled in baskets of wicker work rendered water tight by a gummy preparation; the squaw stands by, with a couple of sticks by way of &quot;tongs,&quot; and pitches heated stones into the mess until it is cooked into a sort of thick mush called <em>&quot;Noopa' </em>which is said to be &quot;good eating,&quot; but this I do not know from experience. There are also several kinds of farinaceous and gummy seeds which the squaws gather, when the plants or stalks are dry, by beating or brushing them with a basket-like fan into a larger basket held low for the purpose. Various kinds of insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, wasps, grubworms &amp;c, are also &quot;laid in&quot; for the winter's consumption. Grasshoppers are held by the Diggers in about the same high estimation with which oysters are regarded by civilized epicures and lovers of good eating. </p><p>In the fall, when the grass is dry and grasshoppers plenty, all hands turn out; men, women, boys and girls, just as a lot of us would go “blackberrying;” a party of them surround half an acre or so with large brushes or brooms of chapparal, driving the grasshoppers in towards the centre. The grass is then fired on all sides and, it being very dry, it burns like a train of gunpowder and the poor grasshoppers catch a scorching. The fire is over so quick that it just singes and browns them &quot;to a turn;&quot; they are then collected in baskets and sacks, bushels of them being sometimes gathered in a day. These are eaten <em>a la parched corn, </em>or crushed up into a pasty mass and eaten with the fingers, of course. These Indians congregate mostly about the towns and are generally allowed to work when they will, pretty much where they please, as all the work they do impoverishes the diggings but very little. There are also government reserves set apart for them in different parts of the state. Their language has rather of a gutteral but pleasing and musical sound, and those who live about the towns and camps learn English very readily. The women are not remarkable for their personal beauty or cleanliness, and the &quot;Bright Alfarata&quot; of Mrs. Sullivan's beautiful ballad would hardly find a representative among the Digger maidens. Their &quot;Rancherias,&quot; or towns, consist of a cluster of wigwams made by driving a lot of long sticks into the ground in a circle, joined together at the top, and the whole covered with strips of bark except an aperture at the top, by way of chimney, and the fire is made in the middle of the floor. Numerous noisy, stiff-eared &quot;cayote&quot; dogs and plenty of fleas, filth and vermin serve to make up the other requirements of a '''Rancheria.'' When a Digger lady loses her husband, her head is covered with pitch and she wears this emblem of mourning for several months. The body of her lord is placed on a pile of logs some two or three feet high, and is burned; the friends crowding around as close as the heat will allow and remaining till the body is consumed. </p><p>Since my last letter we have had plenty of rain. The spring rains come in finely; all were praying for rain and now we have it in abundance, enough to supply even the very dryest parts of the mines. In some places the rain poured down with a perfect prodigality, causing freshets which destroyed dams, sluices and did other injury. The &quot;hard times&quot; are getting better, the miners are doing well and all kinds of business has received a fresh impetus. But this line fills up my sheet, therefore, for the present, adieu.

Rock07,"<p>No. 7.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort Grizzly, El Dorado Co., Cal.,</p><p>April 22d, 1855.</p><p>“Winter’s dreary reign is over,<br />Vernal airs blow soft again.”</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -Spring has come. “That’s no news,” says, you, “spring came a month ago.” Well allowing it did, I wish you to understand, that Fort Grizzly occupies an elevated situation in this world, and spring does not attain to this elevation until most other parts of the country have been served. It is spring; for “the grass is springing fresh and green; the soap roots are sprouting, and the old oaks are leaving out.</p><p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of the month, a storm set in, which lasted three days snowing and raining pretty much all the time. It gave us four inches of snow on a level, but since their, the warm spring weather has carried it all off again. We have seen snow to our hearts content this winter, and much more than I saw in the hard winter of ’49. In January, we had it two feet deep on a level. It was a good opportunity then for hunting, and many took advantage of it, for the deer could not travel fast, and were easily tracked up. One of my neighbors, Ned W--, and myself, took our rifles one morning and sallied forth on a grand hunt, fully determines to “massacre” the first unfortunate “venison” that should cross our trail; but ill luck attended us; we waded through the deep snow, up the steeps and down the ravines, all day, not seeing so much as a squirrel to shoot at, and about sunset were wending our toilsome way homeward, hungry, cross, tired and disappointed, when on a sudden we saw an animal dash across the trail some three hundred yards ahead of us, and disappeared in the chapperal. “There!” exclaimed Ned, “did you see that dog?” “No,” said I, “that wasn’t a dog.” “Yes it was a dog too,” said Ned; “his master must be hunting near here, and you’ll see him presently.” “No siree Ned,” said I, “that was no ‘Indian dog,” that was a Coyote.” “coyote” he blow’d” said Ned, “that was an Indian dog.” “Well Ned,” said I, “you seem to be rather <em>dog</em>matical about it, but, “Indian dog” or “Coyote,” he’s taken a turn, and is coming up the ravine right towards us; sure enough, there he was coming trotting up the ravine through the low bushes. As he neared us, we got a better view of him, and h hey! what?!! No “dog,” no “coyote,” but a veritable <em>deer</em>; a “fat young buck.” In an instant we dodged to cover behind a big tree, and stood ready to give that deer “fits.” We were both much excited and I could see by Ned’s eye that he meant to get the first shot at him, and have the honor of killing him if he could. I meant he shouldn’t and therefore stood ready. Just then the deer appeared from the bushes, about forty yards below, scented us, and with a short, quick bound, stood stock still, snuffing the air, with his side presented towards us. Now was our time; we both fairly trembled with excitement; up went Ned’s rifle, mine followed suit; a quick, hasty aim was taken; both rifles cricked with one report, and with three or four tremendous bounds, the “venison” disappeared over the next ridge. We both followed him with our eyes till he was out of sights, and then, for the space of five minutes, stood face to face, surveying each other. At length Ned broke out with, -“well I suppose you call yourself a <em>hunter</em>, d ---l of a hunter <em>you</em> are, I can make a better hunter out of ‘puakin stems’; as for myself, if any man says “venison” to me, or calls me a “hunter” hereafter, I’ll smash his nose and knock his eye out for him.” I was like the boy that was caught “hooking” preserves; I had “nothing to say.” If we had not been so much excited, but had taken a cool, deliberate aim, we should certainly have killed the deer; but taking a hurried, insufficient aim as we did, and shooting down hill at that, we overshot him. Moddily, and in silence, we trudged on home; as it was now dusk, but near camp, where our two paths turned off, Ned stopped, and with one finger raised very impressively said:-- “If you ever tell anything about this scrape, I’ll break your head.” I as impressively promised him that “I wouldn’t if he didn’t,” and we separated. I felt most ridiculously like laughing all the evening, whenever I thought of that “deer,” and must have laughed in my sleep, for I dreamed of it; but whenever any one asks me anything concerning that “hunt,” I always refer them to Ned. I did ask him the other day “which resembled a ‘deer’ the most, an ‘Indian dog,’ or a ‘coyote,’ but he replied with a certain most expressive look from his wicked black eyes that told me it wouldn’t do.</p><p>The miners all have plenty of water now to work with, and have no good excuse for not washing. In general they are doing well and business of all kind is looking up. The farmers are all busy, sowing and planting, and look confidently forward for a fine season for their crops. In the spring of the year, I think California, the mining region especially, is the most beautiful country in the universe. Everything grows luxuriantly; flowers of every hue, shade and shape, cover the green hill-sides and the verdant plains; indeed, it is one vast flower garden. But abler pens than mine, have written of “California flowers,” and have done better justice to the subject than I can do. Some of the banking houses that “suspended payments,” a short time ago in the “hard times,” have recommenced operations, but some of them will remain “suspended,” as their latest operation appears to have consisted in pocketing the “cash” and “sandersizing,” which I presume means about the same thing as running off with the funds! The public confidence in banks has been too much shaken lately, to recover immediately, and it will be a long time before any banking or express concern, will have the same confidence placed in it as Californians, and especialy the mining community, places in Adams &amp; Co. &quot;Raffles&quot; appear to be the order of the day here just now. The miners, as well as others here in California, are a very gullible set of people, and whenever anyone has property in the way of jewelry which they cannot readily dispose of to advantage, all they have to do is make up a &quot;raffle,&quot; sell tickets and thus dispose of their property at about four times the real value. There are several heavy ones just now on the tapis, and the great flaring handbills and posters glower at you from every corner. &quot;Wade's grand gift enterprise!!!&quot; &quot;Maupin's grand raffle!!!&quot; &quot;Painter's grand raffle!!!&quot; &quot;Turner's lottery!!!&quot; &amp;c, all showing conclusively how a &quot;fortune&quot; <em>may </em>be made by the investment of &quot;only one dollar.&quot; Extremely dubious investment. But with this last remark, we’ll close our already too long letter. Yours truly, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock07.jpg
Rock08,"<p>No. 8.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,</p><p>May 28<sup>th</sup>, 1885.</p><p>“Moving on.”</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:- </p><p>You probably perceive by the date of this letter that I am no longer a citizen of &quot;Fort Grizzly,&quot; but since writing you last I have pulled up stakes and emigrated to this place [Fort John], where my partner and myself are snugly ensconced in a &quot;summer residence&quot; of cloth, sticks and boards. Fort Grizzly had become, in our estimation, rather of a poverty stricken locality, so, therefore, we sought a place more congenial to our feelings as regards mining and digging for gold. But let no one suppose from this place being called &quot;Fort John&quot; that it is a real warlike fortification, with cannon and U.S. troops to match, for therein they would be greatly deceived. Fort John is situated on the south fork of Dry creek, a tributary of the San Joaquin, about sixty-five miles southeast from Sacramento City, and consists of some twenty or thirty straggling log and shingle houses or shanties and a &quot;grocery,&quot; and as for a &quot;fort,&quot; there is no such species of a building here, unless indeed, some one of the old log cabins could be dignified as such. It is a very quiet, picturesque and pretty little place, deeply embosomed among the mountains, and the diggings here bear the name of being among the best. There is a scarcity of water here, for mining purposes, in the summer months, but public enterprise will soon overcome that difficulty, and without &quot;petitions,&quot; &quot;newspaper controversies&quot; or &quot;town meetings,&quot; simply by introducing water from the head of the Mokelumne river by means of some fifteen miles of canal. </p><p>Enclosed I send you a small branch or twig of the renowned &quot;big tree&quot; of the Calaveras, of which you have probably read. This celebrated tree, together with some eighty-four others comprise what is known as &quot;the Mammoth Tree Grove&quot; in Calaveras County.</p><p>It is situated between the San Antonio branch of the Calaveras river, and the North branch of the Stanislsus, in latitude 38 degrees north, and longitude 120 degrees, 10 minutes West, and is about 5,200 feet above the level of the sea. Here within an area of eighty acres, and high above the surrounding trees of the forest, tower the heads of these evergreen forest giants.</p><p>There are none like them upon the earth, yet known to man, in size or kind, and being truly American, they are suitably named by naturalists, “<em>Washingtonia Gigantea,</em>” although they are more generally known as the “Mamoth Trees.” The &quot;Big Tree&quot; was felled a year ago last summer and a large section of the bark was taken off, also a section of the trunk, to send home to the World's Fair. It was indeed a forest giant, measuring in circumference, at the base, 92 feet, was 300 feet high, and thought to be 3,000 years old. In order to fell it, it had to be bored off by means of long augers, as it was <em>rather </em>too large to admit of being chopped down with an axe. You can judge something of the size of the stump when I tell you that a snug hotel is built upon it for the accommodation of visitors, and a bowling alley is constructed on the upper side of the main trunk as it lies upon the ground. This was the largest living tree in the grove, although there are others lying prostrate there, long since dead, which are much larger. The next living tree in point of size, the “Mother of the Forest,” is still standing although it has been stripped of its bark, averaging 11 inches in thickness, which has been removed for the purpose of exhibition in the Atlantic States and Europe. The “Father of the Forest” is a large, old dead tree, lying prostrate, and nearly half buried in the earth, and measuring at the roots 110 feet in circumference. It is hollow for 200 feet of its length, through which distances a person can walk erect. When standing, the height of this tree is estimated to have been 400 feet. Another tree of the same sort, also lying prostrate, called the “Burnt Tree,” is 97 feet in circumference, and 330 feet in length. It is hollow for 60 feet, into which a person can ride on horseback for that distance. “Hercules,” “Twin Brothers,” “Three Sisters,” “Siamese Twins,” “Lone Widow,” “Beauty of the Forest,” &amp;c., are the various and appropriate names of several other trees of immense size. The average diameter of the eighty-five trees of this grove, is about 11 feet, although there are twenty-five feet in diameter at the base.</p><p>At Fort Grizzly also, there are some very large trees, although they are hardly to be mentioned on the same sheet of paper with the “Mammoth Trees,” and while there, I measured several of them, which were 18 and 20 feet in circumference at the base, and one large sugar pine, lying prostrate, measured 22 feet in circumference, and 260 feet in length. You may think, Friend Rock, that I am spinning a pretty tall year, about tall trees, and such big stories concerning the big timber here in California, may seem rather “tough” to those whose ideas of “big trees” are connected with the elms in the town square, but, nevertheless these statistics are correct, and well authenticated.</p><p>The weather lately has been unusually cool, and rainy for this season of the year, but it is all the better for miners and farmers. With these last remarks, let’s close.</p><p>Yours most truly, BENBOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock08.jpg
Rock09,"<p>No. 9.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,</p><p>June 10<sup>th</sup>, 1885.</p><p>&quot;The summer days are coming,</p><p>The blossom decks the bough,</p><p>The bees are daily humming,</p><p>And the birds are singing now.&quot;</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: - Summer is revisiting California, the word &quot;summer&quot; generally signifying here clear unclouded sky week after week - hot broiling sun - thermometer often up to 110 deg. in the shade and a great consequent demand for cool places and iced drinks. The hottest part of the season is not yet. August, I think, is the hottest, but it is very warm here in the mines even now, and the miners all take pretty long &quot;noonings,&quot; enjoying their &quot;siesta&quot; after dinner under the shade of some sturdy oak or waving pine. A brush shade or &quot;ramada,&quot; as it is generally termed, is also found to be quite comfortable. This is made by means of upright posts or forks supporting cross poles which are thickly covered with green bushes; it makes a cool and delightful shade, and many miners have no other sort of house during the summer season, as there is but little rain and the material for building cheap and handy. &quot;Lee &amp; Marshall's grand National Circus and Hippodrome&quot; is now making another tour through the mines. They come round every four or five months and perform one or two nights in each of the principal towns and villages in the mining region. They were at Volcano a few days ago and in the evening their big tent was crowded to its utmost capacity with a well pleased audience. (Admittance - boxes, $2.00, pit $1.00.) The miners flocked in from all quarters. The pick and shovel were laid aside, &quot;best hats,&quot; clean shirts and light boots were donned, and every creek, gulsh and arroyo sent forth its delegation. </p><p>As Volcano is only about four miles from here, all &quot;Fort John&quot; were &quot;thar;&quot; all who were possessed of the requisite amount of funds, of course, were sure to go, and those who were so unfortunate as not to have the &quot;needful&quot; by them, applied to old &quot;Mother Earth&quot; with pick and shovel persuasions and soon obtained it. Even the Indians went, and &quot;last,&quot; but let us presume not &quot;least,&quot; your humble servant, Mr. Bolt, chained his trusty dog &quot;Gumbo&quot; to the cabin door and went also. I passed an Indian with his squaw on the trail to Volcano, and asked him if he was going to the Circus. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;me wooksum (go) Circus.” “Me mucha likum Circus.&quot; Then, shaking a couple of dollars joyfully between his two hands, he said, &quot;Sabe? (understand) two dollar;” “me, my mo-haily” (squaw) catch'em Circus. I passed on and was soon into town. On all the trails I passed I noticed that the foot tracks were all pointed towards Volcano, not one in the opposite direction . . . The tent was of the largest size and, as I have said before, it was &quot;jam full,&quot; and some fifty or more ladies graced and gladdened the occasion by their presence. The Indians were all in the &quot;pit&quot; and enjoyed the scene very highly, most especially the &quot;tight rope performance&quot; by &quot;Mad Austin,&quot; who danced a &quot;pas de seul&quot; and kicked up generally on a tight rope elevated horizontally some seven feet from the ground, just as easily as any person would do the same on a good level floor. A chair was set up on the rope, and she stood up in it without any very apparent effort at equilibrium. The Indians opened their eyes wider than ever; it rather &quot;took them down,&quot; and well it might, for it was hard to beat. The music was excellent, the horses were well trained, the riding was fine, the gymnastics were well performed, and one fellow did flip-flaps from the spring board at the rate of twenty revolutions a minute till the audience all cried out &quot;stop him!&quot; One man tossed and played with big cannon balls as though they were marbles, while others in tin-foil shirts and gilt tights performed on stilts or walked about on their hands in preference to walking on their feet, or, with their arms and legs twisted in together, galloped about the ring like so many big <em>&quot;tarantulas.&quot; </em>In short they seemed to court every shape but the &quot;human shape divine.&quot; The whole performance passed off to the full satisfaction of the audience, and nothing occurred to mar the pleasures of the occasion. The rivers are all pretty high at present, owing to the melting of the mountain snows, but the creeks and gulshes are fast drying up from the effects of the warm, dry weather we have had lately. Snow is brought down in waggons from the summits of the Sierra to supply the towns and cities with the wherewith to furnish cool drinks, &amp;c. Ice is also shipped from Sitka. Green peas and such other green vegetables have been in the market for some time; rather earlier I think than you get them at home. There appears to be rather of a lull in politics just at present, and all parties seem to be taking breath preparatory to the coming Presidential election of next year. The &quot;know nothings&quot; or &quot;American party&quot; seem to be in the ascendant.

Rock10,"<p>No. 10.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,</p><p>June 24<sup>th</sup>, 1855.</p><p>“The coachman loudly cracked his whip,<br />The horses pranced and reared, ---“</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: --</p><p>Did you ever ride in stagecoach? Of course you have; but did you invariably go to sleep, or keep awake to observe and study the characters, and criticize the words and actions of your fellow passengers?</p><p>It is a queer study, and quite instructive and amusing too, sometimes. I was riding once in a coach from Stockton to Double Springs, up the Calaveras road, and as is usually the case in California, my fellow passengers were a “motley crew” of various nations. There were three Chinamen, a Dutch girl, and fat old Mexican lady, a Frenchman, and three of us Americans. It was a sultry day, and it, together with the monotonous roll of the coach, as we passed over the level plains, made us all, more or less somnolent. The three Chinamen on the front seat were soon sound and last asleep, weaving from side to side, and against each other, as the coach rolled. One of my American friends was unconsciously paying his respects to the Dutch girl, while the other, with an india-rubber hinge situated in the back of his neck, bowed fiercely and unremittingly, to nothing in particular. I tried to engage in conversation with the Mexican lady, but all to no purpose, for she and the Dutch girl opposite, with both eyes shut, were establishing a mutual understanding.</p><p>The old Frenchman, with a rare paper in his hand, containing an account of the doings of the “allied forces” in the East, bowed with great characteristic politeness to the company generally, and to me in particular, until his head inclined forward and gradually assumed the position of a butting ram. I tried hard to keep awake; I whistles “Yankee Doodle,” coughed, spit, and gazed out on the face of the country, but I saw nothing but level, sleep looking fields of grain, enclosed by long monotonous wire fences.</p><p>A zig-zag tortuous, “Virginia fence” enlivened the scene for a short time, but at the end of it came a terrible sleepy looking mule, standing with ears lopped forward, and both eyes shut, under the shade of a great lazy oak tree. My eyes closed; I saw no more: I gradually became a large Russian city, white the old Frenchman’s head was transformed into a huge bomb-shell, about to be projected at my walls. From this pleasing delusion, I was suddently awakened by a heavy shock, which send all us rear passengers to the front, charging. The old Frenchman was rubbing the side of his head with his hand, exclaiming sacrrre, with a terrible roll of his tongue, while I, after readjusting my neck, which was partially dislocated by the shock, jumped out to see what night be the matter. We had only stopped at a ranch, to change horses, and in driving up to the house, our “John” had carelessly run the near fore wheel against a tree, bringing us up “all standing,” or “tumbling,” just which you please. The Frenchman went into the house, and consoled himself with a “<em>capita de cognac</em>.” The Dutch girl called for a glass of lager beer.” The Mexican senora called for a glass of water, with <em>un poco de aqua diente</em>” to “qualify” it; fresh horses were harnessed in, and we were soon on our way again. We were shortly among the fast hills of the Sierra, and the ground being rather rough and uneven, there was not much chance for sleep, so the most of us entered into mutual conversation. My two American friends seemed to be transcendentally inclined, for the subject of the conversation was “the quickness of thought.” One of them was a hale, hearty old gentleman, of about sixty years of age, while the other was a pale, slim, nervous looking man, of about thirty-five.</p><p>I listened with much interest to their conversation, as they gradually warmed with the immensity of the subject. The younger, especially, seemed to be completely carried away with the greatness of the idea, and could hardly find words of sufficient comprehensiveness to express his feelings on the subject; indeed, he was several times at a loss for words, and the old gentleman had to help him out.—“Thought,” said the old gentleman, stumping his cane down on the floor of the coach, by way of emphasis, “thought pervades the universe; it is universal and diffuses itself through our being. It is transcendental, and floats in the immensity of space; it rules our brain, and guides all our actions.”</p><p>“Ah!” ejaculated the younger, clasping his hands convulsively together, what says Milton? The immortal Milton?” “D—m Milton!” exclaimed the elder with warmth;-- what did he know about it; he couldn’t begin to comprehend the immensity of the subject.” “Pshaw! The quickness of thought can’t be comprehended or described. The ‘iron horse’ speeds swiftly over the level track, the report of the rifle quickly follows the flash, and the whizzing bullet flies swiftly through the air.—The howling winds blow swift, and the report of a cannon at a distance is borne quickly to our ears, but sir, can any of these be compared to the quickness of thought? No sir? I tell you they can’t begin.” The younger had become more and more excited, and as the old man concluded, with hands clasped, and his eyes rolling ludicrously around, he exclaimed, in a state of nervous agitation,-- “Heavens! – sir; thought! Is the very height of sublimity. Its quickness is not to be comprehended by any moral mind. The magnetic telegraph sir, is—is—nothing to it. Thought! Sir, is as much swifter than—is as much swifter than—than” – “chain lightning, as chain lightning is swifter than an ox-team,” added I, by way of a “wind up” to his grand peroration, for he had got up to such a pitch of eloquence, that I thought he needed assistance to get down from it. He sprang forward, and grasped me by both hands, exclaiming:-- “You have it sir! –you have it! You have compressed the whole idea into a nut-shell! You have hit the nail on the head!” “This gentleman,” and he, turning to the old man—but the old fellow was thrown back in his seat, with the tears fairly running down his cheeks, and almost bursting with convulsive laughter. The Chinamen too, were laughing, although they didn’t understand a word of what had been said. The old Frenchman politely took a huge pinch of snuff, to keep from laughing, as he observed, “<em>un discussion ver comique Messieurs.”</em> Our nervous friend looked extremely silly, but what he might have said more, was lost to us, as the coach now stopped at the hotel, where he left us, we thanking him for the pleasure his conversation had afforded us. “Crack went the whip, round went the wheels,” and away we whirled again on our road to Double Springs, where I took leave of my fellow passengers.</p><p>The weather is very warm here in the mines now; yesterday the thermometer stood at 102 degrees in the shade, at noon. Preparations are being made in all parts of the country, to celebrate the “ever glorious fourth,” properly, and no doubt it will be trotted through in style. But let’s quit for the present, as my sheet is filled; so, good bye. BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock10.jpg

A most unreasonable amount of powder was burnt, and the thunder of big guns, and the cracking and popping of rifles, revolvers and other small arms, resounded most patriotically throughout the length and breadth of this golden portion of Uncle Sam's dominions. </p><p>At early dawn Fort John was alive, stirring and noisy. Guns, pistols, and everything that would burn powder, were put in requisition, and the old hills and mountains hereabouts, resounded with patriotic echoes. After breakfast all hands mustered, formed into quite an extensive military organization, and &quot;single file,&quot; preceded by fife and drum, playing “Yankee Doodle,&quot; marched down town. In front of each of the principal cabins, we halted, marched, manouvred and countermarched, fired a ratling volley in honor of the day and passed on. The principal mercantile house in Fort John is called the &quot;Last Chance House;&quot; facetiously so called by the proprietor, from the fact that when he commenced business here, he thought it his &quot;last chance&quot; in California. Here we fired several volleys, the fife played &quot;Hail Columbia,&quot; and we gave nine cheers, three for Fort John, three for the &quot;Last Chance House,&quot; three for the landlord of the “Last Chance,&quot; and then gave one good one in honor of the day to finish up with. Some of the boys got a couple of flat rocks with the two flat sides placed one on top of the other, and a quantity of powder between; this was exploded by means of a piece of safety fuse, and it made a terrible noise. We marched down the creek and up again, and then crossed over to the &quot;Gilbert House,&quot; where we fired several volleys, and gave numerous noisy cheers in honor of the day, as well as in honor of &quot;Gilbert&quot; and the &quot;Gilbert House.&quot; Whether the landlords &quot;stood treat&quot; or not, or whether any of the citizens of Fort John imbibed anything stronger than ginger-pop or soda water, we'll not mention in this connection; but if there was &quot;anything stronger,&quot; &quot;cocktails&quot; or &quot;sherry cobblers,” for instance, taken as a &quot;corrective” of the stomach, let us excuse it, on the ground that the &quot;Maine Liquor Law&quot; .has not yet extended its protecting arm over the benighted denizens of this barbarous region, where men are allowed to carry a bottle or a jug in their hand if they choose, and no official superintendent of the public welfare, to make a descent upon him, and confiscate those aforesaid bottles and jugs because they may happen to have a little whiskey in them. Perhaps the day may come when &quot;Maine Liquor Riots&quot; may become known in these parts, when sharp-nosed policemen will invade the log cabins and little tents of the miners, keen on the scent to discover some concealed bottle of whiskey; but as there is no immediate prospect of any such a thing, and as Fort John has not become Portlandized yet we'll not anticipate. In the evening some thirty of us marched down to Fiddletown, a place six miles below here.</p><p>We had heard a heavy field piece as we thought, booming in that direction at several times that day, and as we approached the town it sounded heavier and plainer. We entered town &quot;single file,&quot; the fife and drum playing the grand national air of &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; amid long and loud cheers from the citizens. Down the main street we went to the other end of the town, where we wheeled about and came up again, halting ever and anon in front of the house of some friend or acquaintance of ours, to give three cheers. The &quot;field piece&quot; which we thought they were firing here, was nothing more than two heavy blacksmith anvils placed one on top of the other, with powder between; and when it exploded it made such a report, that as I was saying, we heard it at Fort John. A party of the Fiddletown boys got together in opposition to us, and marched down the street, with five fiddles in front, by way of a &quot;band,&quot; and styling themselves the &quot;Fiddletown Doughheads.&quot; As the two &quot;bands&quot; passed, each tried to drown the music of the other, but in vain did the combined catguts squeak. Our fifer with protruding eyes and distended cheeks, blew his shrillest blast, while our ambitious drummer put in his prettiest licks. The fiddlers were nowhere; they lost their tune completely, not being able to hear their own fiddles. The &quot;Doughheads&quot; gave us three cheers, which we returned with interest. They acknowledged themselves beaten and agreed that we &quot;laid over them heavy.&quot; In front of the U.S. Hotel we came to a final halt, gave three cheers for Uncle Sam, and dismissed for supper. The gentlemanly landlord of the U.S. Hotel served us with a capital supper, to which we did ample justice, after which we took a turn about town to see the sights and fashions and our acquaintance. About twelve o'clock the roll of the drum called us together, and after marching down street and up again, we marched out as we came in, to the tune of Yankee Doodle, amid the cheers of the citizens, who all acknowledged that &quot;Fort John had fairly taken Fiddletown.&quot; We got home safe and sound at about daylight in the morning, well pleased with our excursion. </p><p>Fourth of July: “Independent day;” day ever to be remembered while one single true American exists, or a son of liberty lives to commemorate it. Anniversary of American independence, many, infinitely happy returns to it. Anniversary ever dear to the American heart, bringing our thoughts to revert back to the “memory of our Pilgrim Fathers,” and of those men of a later date, Washington, and the heroes of ’76. Year after year through endless centuries, may it ever be with us, to remind us that –</p><p>“The star spangled banner, in triumph still waves,<br />O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.”</p><p>Yours, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock11.jpg
Rock12,"<p>No. XII.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,</p><p>Aug. 11<sup>th</sup>, 1855.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:--</p><p>Again I greet you, but unlike my last letter, I have now to give you an account of a scene of blood. Lower Rancherie, near this place, was on Monday night last, the scene of a horrible tragedy. A murder most diabolical, inhuman, and fiendish in execution, and details ever before known in the history of California, since the days of the famous mountain bandit Jaaquin. A band of Mexican desperadoes, entered the town about ten o’clock in the evening and with pistol and knife, butchered all who came in their way. It is a small town in the dry diggings, consisting of a tavern, a store, and a few other houses, and there not being water sufficient for mining purposes, was nearly deserted at the time. The fiends attacked the tavern and store simultaneously, massacring all whom they met, their sole object being robbery and murder. Four med, a woman, and an Indian, were killed at once, and three other men were badly wounded. All made their escape who could. Mr. Dimon, the landlord, and his wife were found lying at the foot of the stairs, having probably attempted to escape by the chambers. Mrs. Dimon was shot through the heart, and probably attempted to escape by the chambers. Mrs. Dimon was shot through the heart, and probably instantly killed. Her husband is still living, but is so badly shot and cut up, that there is but a very small hope of his life. One of the boarders, by the name of Wilson, and the bar keeper, were also instantly killed. Mr. Francis, the proprietor of the store, was about closing for the night, and had just deposited his money in his safe, locked it up and put the key in his pocket, as he was shot down. The clerk was near the desk, and fell against the counter, shout through the head, and a long knife was plunged into his breast, passing completely through his body, and coming out his back. He was found behind the counter dead, and on the top of the counter, was a large pool of gore. Mr. Francis was not instantly killed, but with his right let shattered, managed in the obscurity to effect his escape by crawling out the back way, upon the hill-side back of the store, and his pursuers in following him in the dark stumbled upon an unfortunate Indian who happened to be lying out there drunk, and mistaking him for Francis, butchered him at once with their knives, mangling him horribly; they then searched him, but of course were unsuccessful in finding the key of the safe. They brought an old axe, and some other tools with them for opening the safe, but finding a lot of new axes ready handled, and pieks in the store, they took them and tried to cut a hole in the top.—They cut through the outer casing, but not being able to get through the composition filling, and the lining, they gave it up, and tried to cut off the hinges, but being but partially successful in this, they charged the key-ole with powder, blew up the lock, and succeeded in opening the safe, and took therefrom as near as can be ascertained from the best authority, about eight thousand dollars.</p><p>Most of the miner thereabouts, who had money had it deposited in this safe, and the knowledge of this money being there, was most probably the cause of this tragedy. In the hotel they took from the desk, about eight hundred dollars. They were nearly half an hour getting the safe open, and as soon as they had got possession of the money, they left, taking with them five horses from the stable near by. As near as can be ascertained, there were about twenty of the villains in all, and there were two Americans among them; all the rest were Mexicans. Some twelve or fifteen miners collected near the town from the neighboring ravines, but not being able to muster more than four shots in all, they did not deem it prudent to give battle. After the murderers had left, Mr. Francis was found, still living, but he was so badly wounded, and his leg was so shattered as to render amputation necessary, he died in consequence, shortly after the operation was performed. Mrs. Dimon leaves to little children to mourn the loss of a kind and gentle mother. They were in bed at the time, and thus escaped the reeking hands of the bloody assassins. Various and conflicting accounts are current in all the newspapers, but I visited the scene of the tragedy yesterday, purposely to get a true and correct version of this truly horrible event. I conversed with one gentle-man who was wounded, and he related to me the ingenious manner in which he made his escape. He was in the bar-room of the hotel at the time of the attack, and with several others who were not shot down at once, endeavored to make his escape, but in trying to get out of a window he was shot through his left arm, and immediately on feeling the shot, he fell back into the room, and under a table pretending to be dead.</p><p>Said he, “as I lay there, they pulled and rolled me about just as they pleased, searching for what I had in my pockets, which, thank God, wasn’t much; but what I feared most was, that they might not think me dead enough; and I was expecting every moment to feel the cold steel between my ribs.” I held my breath, and tried hard to keep my heart from beating, but if they had felt for my heart, they would have had to feel somewhere about the roots of my tongue, and then they would have found it going thump! thump!—like a big trip-hammer.” As soon as he could get an opportunity, he crawled out through the kitchen, and effected his escape. The boarders had mostly retired to their beds up stairs, out when the shooting commences, they made their escape through the windows. In the store I also saw three knives which were found about there. One was a long Chinese knife, about eighteen inches in length, much bent up having probably been used in opening the sale; another was a large, heavy knife, made of a blacksmith’s rasp; the third was a regular Texas bowie knife, and had been used to some purpose, for it was bloody to the hilt. Before daylight the alarm was spread in the neighboring towns, and in the morning large parties started in pursuit. Three of the villains were overtaken, but a short distance from the place, and were immediately taken back to Lower Rancharie, and hung to the limb of a big oak tree. When taken, one of them had some of the jewelry belonging to the unfortunate Mrs. Dimon, and another had her husband’s watch. When hung, they were placed upon a cart, with the ropes about their necks, and as the cart moved from under them, they took off their hats, swing them around, saying, “adios senores,” (good bye sirs.) Two more were taken and hung in Jackson, and another in Sutter. Six of them are dead, that we know of, and if the rest escape, they will be smart, for companies of mounted rangers are out, scouring the country in all directions, hot upon their tracks. As fast as taken they will by lynched. Civil law does not recognize them at all, and the people about Lower Rancharie say, that if they catch the two Americans who were concerned in the affair they will <em>burn</em> them, for hanging is too mild a death for such. Circulars are out in all directions, posted up in every town, calling on all good citizens to take immediate measures to prevent such doings in future. Delegates have been sent from all the towns to a county convention, which was held at Jackson, the county seat, last evening. The Indians have fearfully avenged the murder of their comrade, for they have killed some seven or eight Mexicans in different places near by. They seem the have taken a roving commission to kill all stray Mexicans, but measures have been taken to stop then. Since the breaking up of Joaquin’s desperate band, nothing like this tragedy has been heard of; but for some time past rumors have been received, of men being found robbed and murdered, on the public trails and highways. A short time ago the Indian diggings stage was stopped late in the evening, by four masked men, who attempted to rob, but the passengers were too strong for them, and they had to give it up. A man belonging to this place, was also chased the other evening, by three men near here, as he was returning home, but he out-ran them. The country for some time, has been comparatively quiet, and civil law has been upheld; but the desperadoes have become emboldened, and now banding together, the midnight assassins are in our midst. Once more has the civil law been laid aside, and the people have taken the administration of justice into their own hands. Vigilance committees are forming everywhere.</p><p>It is but a short time, since the legislature passed a law suppressing public gambling in this state, thus throwing plenty of Mexican “Monte dealers” and others upon the public, to make their living as best they may, and they had all rather rob and murder than to work.—All the Mexicans have been driven already from Drytown and others of the neighboring places, and the consequences of this bloody tragedy will be, that all of them will be driven from this part of the country. Means are on foot to make them do so, and they will surely have to leave. No more to present. </p><p><br />Yours, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock12.jpg
Rock13,"<p>No. XIII.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,</p><p>Aug. 27<sup>th</sup>, 1855.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: - I attended an Indian &quot;fandango&quot; the other day, and presuming that an account of the &quot;doing&quot; on that occasion may not prove uninteresting to your readers, I'll make it the subject of this letter. </p><p>A large party of us went together from here to the place where the fandango was held, which was about five miles from here, on the Cosumnes river, and arrived there just at dusk in the evening. Here on a small knoll or elevation of the plain, the Cosumnes tribe were dancing around a pole about twenty feet high, with a small American flag flying at the top. They were all rigged out as usual on such occasions, with a profusion of paint and feathers, and seemed to enter into the dancing with great spirit and zeal, notwithstanding that this was the third day of the festival, and they had yet another day to dance before it concluded. To a French professor of the Terpsichorean art, their performances on the &quot;light fantastic toe&quot; would possess less of merit than of novelty, as it consisted only of an easy hop from one foot to the other, with a sort of rolling, sideways motion, stamping flat-footed each time, all standing in a circular huddle, facing towards the centre. The old saying of &quot;let those who dance, pay the fiddler,&quot; would hardly apply to their case, as each one was his own &quot;orchestra,&quot; holding in his mouth a couple of whistles, about a foot long, lashed together. These were made of alder, with the pith punched out, and not being tuned to chord with each other at all, they produced a wild, novel, but yet not unpleasing sound, as they all blew together with each alternate stamp of the foot. One ridiculous look ing Digger, with a dirty face and black paint daubed on at random, and a single hawks' tail feather stuck in his hair behind, stood in the midst of the group and seemed to act as master of ceremonies, and they all kept time with feet and whistles, as he sang with a loud monotonous voice: - hi-ho-hi-hi-haw &amp;c., a syllable at each stamp of the feet and blast of the whistles, as his delighted brethren hopped, stamped and blew most energetically. This dance or whatever you may please to call it, they would keep up with great spirit and animation for about ten minutes at a heat, when with two whirling hops and two unanimous yells, they would rest for a few minutes and then go at it again. The women of the tribe, as well as most of the men, did not dance, but only acted as spectators, or were engaged playing at &quot;monte&quot; near the fires. I was conversing with an intelligent young chief, who spoke English, and he told me that all those who were painted and dancing were of the &quot;medical&quot; order; and he pointed out several whom he said were &quot;big medicine men&quot;—“big doctor.&quot; </p><p>This is what they term the &quot;Medical&quot; festival, and usually lasts four days, in which the neighboring tribes join. The young chief told me that many years ago, at a &quot;fandango&quot; here, some of the neighboring tribes brought a kind of poison with them which poisoned this tribe, making them all &quot;much sick;&quot; since then, he says the &quot;doctors&quot; of this tribe have found out that poison; therefore, being equal to them, they can safely defy them and their poison. On the morrow, he said, the other tribes would come in and join in &quot;big fandango.&quot; This festival or &quot;fandango,&quot; is in commemoration of the time of the poisoning. </p><p>About 11 o'clock in the evening, the dancing ceased for the present, and several sick children were brought into the group for the &quot;big doctors&quot; to &quot;operate&quot; upon, which they did in the following manner: - They gave the child a small piece of a certain kind of root to chew, and then on their hands and knees, applying their lips to the naked breast, side or back of the child, gave a long suck, as though they could &quot;extract&quot; the disease in that way; then turning aside, they would spit and gag most ridiculously, making violent but unsuccessful efforts to vomit, from the supposed effects of the <em>mouthfuls of disease </em>they had thus extracted. They continued this operation for about half an hour. What might be the Hygerian effect of such a course of treatment, I felt hardly competent to say, but perhaps some of our medical friends in Plymouth may understand the philosophy of it, and avail themselves of it in their future practice. </p><p>After this performance was over, we looked about for a place to sleep, and finding a large haystack about a mile farther up the river, we monopolized it, sixteen of us in all, and slept soundly till morning. At sunrise next morning we went back to the scene of operations, and shortly afterwards the Indians commenced dancing again, more spirited than ever. &quot;Old Santiago,&quot; their chief, with no other article of wearing apparel besides a pair of rather short pants on, was making himself pretty busy, keeping the squaws and white men off to one side from the space allotted to the dancers, and all were looking out to the westward, from which quarter the other tribes were to come; and occasionally some half dozen of the &quot;big doctors,&quot; leaving the rest of the fraternity dancing, would rush forward and throw themselves in an attitude of defiance towards the west. </p><p>About 9 o'clock the Log-Town and Mud Springs Indians made their appearance on the plain about a quarter of a mile off, and as they approached the Cosumnes Indians waxed warmer in the cause, dancing furiously, while the &quot;great medicines&quot; would rush forward in a very excited manner, throw themselves into the attitude of defiance and then rush back, spitting and pretending to vomit, at the very sight of their adversaries. A large flat stone, with a lot of certain kinds of dried roots upon it, was placed near the dancers and to this the &quot;doctors&quot; would rush, break off a small piece of the root, clap it into their mouths, and thus regain strength to face the approaching tribes. It was a curious sight indeed to view the manner of their approach. They were about thirty in number, scattered all over the plain by twos and threes, all of them creeping up, bent over and crawling in all manner of grotesque positions, with their whistles in their mouths, and painted and feathered in the most ludicrous manner. Their approach was slow, and as the foremost of them drew near, they would occasionally whirl on one heel, thus loosening a little of the hard dry earth ; then pointing with a stick or their whistles, one of the Cosumnes &quot;doctors&quot; would be singled out and a handful of dust thrown towards him. This had the infallible effect to drop him as though he was killed; sometimes three or four of them would be down at a time, apparently struggling in the last agonies of death, and appearing to be shot through the heart, kidneys and other vital parts, groaning and howling most piteously; but it was soon over, for they would convulsively start up, with just strength enough to stagger to the big stone, where they would take a fresh chew of root of salvation, and immediately with renewed energy rush to the front to face the enemy, again to be shot down. </p><p>It was as good as a Circus. They were all killed a dozen times apiece, but the antidotal root, by bringing them immediately to life again, enabled them to resume the attitude of defiance, and at last, as their adversaries came within reach, they rushed out, took them prisoners, and brought them in to join the dancers, which they did with right good will. This farce was repeated as long as a &quot;foe&quot; remained to throw dirt and be captured by the resurrected heroes. These tribes then all were united in a grand dance and whistle concert round the flag-staff. Soon the Michigan bar Indians were seen approaching. They came on just as the others had done were of about the same number and were received about the same, but with more enthusiasm, as there were more dancers, doctors, and whistlers, and two toothless old squaws stood out in front, dancing and throwing dirt with both hands towards them. They were all taken the same as the others, and when all were fairly &quot;fraternized&quot; and dancing fantastical and ludicrous looking beings that one could well imagine. Louder and louder blew the whistles and fiercer yet stamped the dancers as they stood all round the flag-staff, while the &quot;big medicines&quot; of each of the tribes all ran skipping like mad one after the other round the outside, hopping like so many big school boys, while the dirty old master of ceremonies stood in their midst singing louder than ever, with hi-hi-ho-hi- haw-hi. These were said to be all belonging to the &quot;medical faculty.&quot; They were all dressed out alike, as far as feathers and paint were concerned, but still no two were painted or feathered alike. Each one had consulted his own artistical taste on that subject. Several of them had on no other clothing except a coat of paint and a profusion of feathers stuck in their hair, without any sort of regard to order or regularity. One big fellow was painted red all over, and had an extra set of ribs and a backbone painted out on his back in white. Another was spotted all over like a leopard or a circus clown. His face was covered with tar, and a lot of little white feathers stuck in it. Several had a lot of hawk's feathers woven into a sort of a robe, which they threw across their shoulders or tied about their waists. </p><p>The women act the part of spectators, cooks and general waiters at these festivals, and no civilized lady and her daughter ever worked harder, or made more bustle on such occasions, than do the Digger ladies of fashion in the preparation of their acorn, grubworm, grasshopper and other delectable delicacies. The dancing was kept up with undiminished ardor till about noon, when they all quit for dinner and to take a little rest, preparatory to dancing till tomorrow morning. We had seen about all that was worth seeing and therefore took up our line of march for Fort John, where we arrived in a couple of hours, well pleased with our excursion. The convention of which I spoke in my last, which was called in relation to the late tragedy at Rancheria, issued a circular throughout the county, commanding all Mexicans and Chilenos to leave this county immediately, but giving them due time to dispose of whatever property they may possess, and a committee of five is appointed in each town in the county to see this carried into effect. Another of the murderers has been taken, tried and hung at Jackson. The high sheriff of this county, Mr. Phoenix, and also the high sheriff of Mariposa county, Mr. Bowline, were both killed a short time ago in trying to arrest a gang of these same desperadoes. Politics is the staple commodity at present and the candidates for the various offices are canvassing the state. The miners are all complaining of &quot;dry times,&quot; and lack of water in the &quot;dry diggings&quot; for mining purposes. But no more now, my letter is already too long, so lets close. </p><p>Yours truly, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock13.jpg
Rock14,"<p>No XIV<br />Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,<br />Nov 1<sup>st</sup> 1855</p><p>Friend Rock</p><p>Two months have elapsed since I wrote you last not from any intentional neglect on my part but from injuries received by the “caving in” of a bank of earth – one of the many accidents incidental to a mining life. I have been confined under the doctor’s care for the past eight weeks, so pleading this as my excuse, we’ll take a fresh start. We have had less rain this summer and fall, than has been known for the past six years, therefore river mining this season is being carried forward to much better advantage than ever before and river miners are now reaping a golden harvest indeed. The system of “fluming” has been more generally adopted in the rivers this season than formerly and places which could not be worked advantageously before are now being made to “pay” well. *Note on opposite page. The whole body of the water in the river is by damming turned through long, wide, flumes, thus leaving the bed of the stream on each side of the flume comparatively dry, and capable of being worked to the very best advantage. The weather is gradually crowing cooler, winter is approaching, and the miners in the dry diggings are anxiously looking forward and wishing for rain; of course the river miners don’t want any such thing – There has been but a very small emigration across the plains this season on account of the hostility of the Indians. A train from Missouri has lately arrived by the northern route, after a long dangerous and fatiguing journey. They report having had to fight Indians a good part of the way. There were about fifty men belonging to the train nearly all well armed with rifles, and Colt’s revolvers carrying in all, over four hundred shots. Only two of the company were killed on the route but several were wounded by the Indians. A great many head of stock were shot, and stolen, and their wagons were very thoroughly riddled. The train was encamped over night in a ravine fringed with willows when they were surprised just after dark, by a large body of Indians who rushed into camp, “stampeded” the horses and drove away thirty three head of them before they could be prevented – Indeed it was so quickly done, that they hardly got a sight at the Indians at all. For eight successive days the train was attached by a body of from one hundred and fifty, to two hundred Sioux Indians. The Indians would charge at full gallop but were met with such a storm of bullets that they never succeeded in getting nearer than fifty yards of the train. Numbers of the Indians were seen to fall every day, but how many were killed, they could not determine.</p><p>So accustomed did the med become to these every day fights that they rather courted the excitement, but they became at length so exasperated by these repeated and harassing attacks, and thefts of the Indians, that when an ox was short or disabled, they killed him, and then made gashes into the flesh and filled them with strychnine, knowing the Indians would eat the carcass.</p><p>You have probably seen long ere this the election returns of this State and perhaps was somewhat surprised at the triumph of the “Know Nothings” or American Party. It is true that the population of this state is composed of a mixture of all nations, and people from every quarter of the globe, but Americans, of course, predominate, and they very generally voted the American ticket. The Whig party did not attempt anything at all &amp; they are nowhere, they are “rubbed out,” and only known of in history. All the foreigners naturally joined with the Democratic party, it having been heretofore the ruling party of the state, and headed by Gov Bigler and a few others of those high in office, they combatted manfully against “Sam,” but the “rank and file” of the party had deserted and gone over to the enemy; and the result of the election shows conclusively that “Sam” is strong in California. *The San Francisco Herald estimates the population of California to be 350,000; 120,000 of whom are engaged in mining, including about 20,000 Chinese. In 1853 the Gubernatorial vote was 76,394 increased in 1855 to 97,693; - doing very well for such a young state. *Neely Johnson the Know Nothing candidate for governor was elected by a majority of 5,011. All the mining countries in fact nearly every county in the State, went the American ticket both for State and county officers. The election generally throughout the State was carried on in a quiet orderly manner, and the polls efficiently protected.</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT</p><p>*It is also universally known, that far less snow fell in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the last than in any previous winder since the discovery of gold within the borders of the State. Owing to this circumstance the streams which derive their liquid supplies from these snowy fastnesses were usually low on the opening of the summer, and the miners consequently enabled not only to commence building their dams and flumes earlier than usual but to construct them the more thoroughly, and with less labor and expense than ever before.</p>",public://rock/Rock14.jpg
Rock15,"<p>No. XV.<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />Fort John, Amador Co., Cal.,<br />Nov 30<sup>th</sup>, 1855.</p><p>“Resounding through the vale below,<br />He hears the pick and spade,<br />And hastes to join the busy throng,<br />And join their delving trade.”</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>Winter, or the “rainy season” is about to visit upon us denizens of the Sierra, its annual quota of snow and rain: and already in the higher mountain passes, the snow has fallen, opposing a chilling barrier to the wagon wheels of the adventurous emigrant. But little rain has fallen thus far, although dark, ominous looking clouds, and sudden changes in the weather, denote approaching storms, and all are anxiously looking forward, and preparing for the coming winter. This is the season of the year for “prospecting,” and daily may be seen “prospecting parties” of twos, and threes, or more, with pick, pan, shovel, and blankets, travelling through the various mining localities, in search of a good “claim” for the winter. They generally stop for a day or two in the place, prospecting, and then “move on,” to prospect other diggings.</p><p>Within view of where I am now sitting, there are three adventurous strangers, hard at work, “sinking a hole” in the bank of the creek. – They are taking it “turn, about,” one working in the hole at the time; they are down about for feet, and as they get nearer to the “bed rock,” each one as he swings the pick, imagines that each stroke brings him nearer to the “good pay,” which he hopes to find at the bottom; but they needn’t get excited; they have got four feet deeper to dig yet, and the, if they get anything more that the “color,” it will be something out of the common course of things. I know something about that bank myself, for just about for rods above where they are diggings, there is another hole, where my partner and myself, invested a couple of days labor in “sinking,” but all to no purpose; for we found “not even the color” in it. That bank never did pay anything at all, anyhow, but it wouldn’t do for me to go up there and tell them so, for they would only attribute it to mercenary motives on my part, and “put in” the harder. Well, its good exercise for them; we’ll let them finish their job, while I tell about one of my prospecting tours.</p><p>One fine morning in the spring of ’51, a party of six of us, including my partner, Charley E—and myself, started for the head waters of the Calaveras, prospecting. We had a mule, belonging to one of the party, to pack all our provisions, tools, blankets, &amp;c., while we carried our rifles. We passed through several mining camps, and over plenty of steep ridges, stopping ever and anon, to prospect some prominent looking ravine, meeting with no accident, until just before sunset, as we were proceeding slowly along a narrow rocky trail, which wound the face of a steep craggy mountain, bordering on the river, the mule’s load caught against a projecting angle of rock, causing him to slip, lose his footing, and the next instant, over he went, rolling and tumbling down the precipice, scattering his load far and near, until at length we saw him stop among the rocks below. We immediately commenced the descent, walking carefully, holding by the bushes and each other, and gathering up our provisions, tools, &amp;c., as we went.</p><p>Our flour covered all the rocks in the vicinity; our camp-kettle resembles and cocked hat in shape; the other cooking utensils were pronounced unfit for service, while our blankets were well seasoned with the pepper, salt and sugar, with which they were plentifully besprinkled. But the poor mule – there he lay among the rocks, moaning, terribly battered and bruised, and both bore legs broken. It was indeed a sad sight, but his master, drawing his revolver, shot him through the head, thus putting him at once out of his misery. Silently and sadly we turned away, and each one taking his share of the load, we started up the river, and about half a mile above, finding a convenient place, we camped for the night.</p><p>Next morning, while breakfast was being prepared, Charley and myself took a short hunt, and were so fortunate as to bring in a fine, fat buck. We had him dressed in double quick time; the fried pork was kicked aside, and soon replaced by “venison ribs,” roasted on the hot coals, which you may be assured are hard to beat in the gastronomic line, particularly so to a hungry miner. After breakfast, the question was asked “shall we keep on or turn back?” which was decided by Dr. C--, the smallest man in the party, who said, “let’s stick her out to-day, boys, anyhow,” so we immediately commenced climbing up the toilsome ascent, with all our “traps” packed on our backs.</p><p>At noon we came across a small camp of miners, where we got some dinner, and having also got a little flour from them, we kept on, and soon arrived at San Antonio creek, the south fork of the Calaveras, where concluding it useless to go farther, we stopped, took a rest, and then began looking about for the most likely places to prospect. We tried several small ravines, with but indifferent success, finding a little gold in all of them, but not enough to satisfy us. In one of the ravines, I notices some animals, tracks of a peculiar shape, with other signs, and bending over and examining them closely, I came to the conclusion that they were those of a grizzly bear. If I had been alone, the discovery would have been anything but an agreeable one to me, but calling to my companions, I showed them the tracks, and we came to the conclusion that if Bruin should dare to trouble us, we would try and have some bear meat to go with our venison.</p><p>That evening we built a rousing fire, and after a hearty supper, being very tired, we spread our blankets before the fire, and all were soon asleep with the exception of myself; not that I did not feel fully as tired as any of the rest, but somehow as I sat before the fire, gazing among the embers, my thoughts seemed to be fixed on anything but sleep, and my mind wandered back to scenes through which I had passed a year or two since. I fancied myself once more on board the ship, dashing gallantly along on her pathless way round Cape Horn, while the porpoises “played” madly under her bow. Now I was in Chili, and the strumming of the guitar, together with the accompanying voice of the performer, seemed still to ring in my ears, as I thought on the fandango halls of Talcahuana. Now again I was in the boat, pulling the “stern oar,” as of old, in an exciting chase after blackfish, and I still seemed to hear the voice of the mate, at the steering oar, as he said to me, “pull! you young  rat! lay down to it! we’ll have him at the next rising!!” Again under the bold, high cliffs of the barren island of St. Berto, I sat in the boat, fishing. I well remembered that time. Eight of us pulled at the oar for five hours under a broiling tropical sun to reach this island for the purpose of fishing.</p><p>Fish there were, and in a short time we had a lot of them; but our fun was cut short, by our lines being all bitten off by the innumerable young sharks which were playing by thousands around the boat. All sized sharks were there, from little slim fellows of a foot long, to big, blue, rascally looking fellows of I dare not say how long, but they had terrible hungry looking eyes, and as they came close alongside the boat, and even rubbed against her, they seemed to be meditating some piratical attack.</p><p>Those hungry eyes I shall ever remember.</p><p>The fire burned low, and fitfully assumed various fantastic shapes and forms; now it assumed the shape of a large ship riding at anchor, and again it seemed a huge castle with long turrets. Suddenly I heard a crackling noise on the opposite side of the fire from me, and my attention was riveted by two bright, glaring eyes peering at me through the blaze. I could even see the outlines of the form, as it stood, huge, and shaggy, glowering upon me.</p><p>Too well I knew the form of a grizzly bear, to be deceived as to what the intruder was. He was within six feet of me, and I could see by the crouching of his form, that he was about to spring upon me. I tried to yell at him, but my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth. I tried to move, but seemed chained to the big stone on which I sat. On a sudden, with a tremendous spring, he leaped upon me – his huge body bore me at once upon my back – with both hands grasping his throat, I lay struggling for life with the monster, when with stunning force he struck me on the head of one of his huge, paws, completely --- startling me, while Charley E—‘s voice shouted in my car, <em>“you Ben!! Ben!!! what the devil are you about, you d—n fool you; let go!!”</em> and another gentle punch which I received in the ribs, brought me to my senses, and I found that it wasn’t a bear, after all, but my partner Charley, that I was engages with. I had only fallen asleep, before the fire, and at the time I thought the bear had me, I had merely fallen over on Charley.</p><p>The camp was aroused by the fuss, and the boys all sprang up, rifle in hand, to see what was the matter. I had to tell them all about the <em>bear</em>, at which we all had a hearty laugh, although I looked and felt rather foolish, and to this day, they “have the laugh on me.” It don’t do for me to try talk about “<em>bears”</em> when Charley or any of the other boys are about. – Next morning early, we packed up, and started back home, where we arrived safely, about noon on the second day, very tired, as you may well suppose. But I see that those three adventurous miners of whom I was writing at the commencement, have finished their hole, and are now testing its auriferous qualities with the pan.</p><p>One of them is washing, and the others are looking anxiously on. That is the eighth pan that I have seen them wash out, and it seems no better than the rest, for with a peculiar whisk of the pan in the water, he works everything out. One of them is gathering up the pick and shovel – there they go; they have shouldered their blankets and tools, and are leaving for some other diggings, while the knowing ones hereabouts, shake their wise heads knowingly as they say, “I knew they wouldn’t find anything in that bank;” but so goes “prospecting.” The next hole they sink they may find a hat full of gold at the bottom. Mr. Bolt would state in this connection that he has sold out his claims in these mines, given away his pick and shovel, and is going to San Francisco to “rusticate;” – therefore I presume my next letter will be dated from that delectable city; till then I remain</p><p>Yours, &amp;c.,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock15.jpg
Rock16,"<p>No. XVI.<br />For our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, Jan. 2, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>Arrived at length at this city, and being here domiciliated for the present, I embrace the opportunity to “render an account of myself,” since my last letter. It was a dirty, drizzly day when I left Fort John, and after two days travel over a rough mountain road, at the end of another dirty, drizzly day, I arrived safely at the far-famed city of Sacramento, where circumstances induced me to stop for a couple of weeks. Sacramento is indeed a thriving city, finely located, and splendidly laid out in squares, with good wide streets. It is at present the seat of government, but how long it will remain so, it is difficult to say, for the capital of the state is proverbially a “moveable institution,” and the Benecia folks are still hopeful of getting it removed to their city. On the evening of the 13<sup>th</sup> of last month, the gas company having completed their arrangements, the city was lighted with gas, for the first time. The water-works, where the water is elevated by steam power, has supplied the city for some time with water. Just to think of it; a city of only some six or seven years growth, for the most part built substantially with brick, and with gas and water works in full operation. A substantial levee, surrounding the entire city, also prevents future danger from the heavy spring floods. In its infancy it battled for existence against both flood and fire, and now firmly established, it will stand through future ages. The Sacramento Valley railroad, the first railroad in California, is now in operation. The road is finished as far as Negro bar on the American river, a distance of twenty-three miles, and the trains commenced running their regular trips from this city to Negro bar, on the 15<sup>th</sup> ult. </p><p>On the evening of the 12<sup>th</sup> ult., Ida Varnard, the notorious cortezan, who some eighteen months ago killed Mary Lee, another of her frail sisterhood, in a fit of jealously, tried her hand at it again. She shot a Mr. Ingalls, wounding him severely, and with her knife she stabbed another man in the lower part of his back, inflicting a severe wound. She was immediately taken to the station house, and is now in prison awaiting her trail for “assault with intent to kill.” At the time she was on trial for the murder of Mary Lee, her pretty countenance, penitent looks and tears, operated most powerfully on the minds and tender hearts of both Judge and Jury, so that although her guilt was apparent, she was dismissed with a fatherly admonition from the lenient Judge, bidding her “go and sin no more,” a remarkable piece of advice, which she has borne in mind, and “sinned no more” than she did before, until the present. Her bail is fixed at $10,000, and some of her influential friends have endeavored to raise the required amount, but unsuccessfully.</p><p>A few days ago, and Irish girl, who had been unsuccessful in obtaining a “situation” through the means of one of the intelligence offices, returned to the office and demanded the three dollars which she had advanced them for their services, which demand of course not being complied with, she went out into the street procured a stone, returned, and smashed in the front window of the office, destroying glass, sash and all, and walked off with head erect, and the stone in her fist, apparently well satisfied with the &quot;sensation&quot; which she had created. The proprietor of the broken window was advised to call a policeman and have her taken to the station house, but although as may be supposed, his temper was considerably ruffled, he merely looked at his broken window and then at the belligerent lady, and stoically remarked, “Oh, d---m her, let her go; if I was to haul her up before the court I should only lose by it, besides making myself appear ridiculous.&quot; I tell you the women in this country are &quot;some&quot; when they set out.</p><p>I street is the Chinese quarter of the city, where are congregated together their dwellings, shops, stores, fish, meat and vegetable markets, and filthy rookeries, teeming with their vile and degraded little women. Most of the Chinese merchants are doing a thriving and lucrative business. Most of the laboring class obtain their livelihood by day labor about the city as porters, &amp;c., or by fishing in the river. Some of them also have &quot;teams,&quot; with which they haul freight to the mines, but they generally drive but one horse, not being able to understand the mysteries of “two horse gear&quot; as yet.</p><p>Sacramento boasts of two fine theatres, and as good companies in them as are to be found in the state. At the Sacramento theatre which is under the management of Mrs. C. N. Sinclair -- the former wife of Edwin Forrest -­ a very beautiful drama, entitle &quot;The Marble Heart, or the Sculptor's Dream,” is being performed nightly, to crowded houses. This piece has the best run, it is said, of any before produced in California.</p><p>Miss Sarah Pellett, has been lecturing throughout California, on the subject of temperance, for the last two years. I attended one of her lectures in Sacramento. The house was filled to its utmost capacity, and hundreds had to leave, not being able to find “standing room&quot; inside. She gave a very god lecture considering, but her voice was hardly strong enough to be heard in all parts of the house. Throughout California, in every city, town, and hamlet, intoxicating liquors of all qualities are sold, in any quantity; from a barrel to a spoonful, and any one with any money at all, can get as drunk as they please, and no law to prevent them; yet it is astonishing how little drunkenness is seen.</p><p>The world wide celebrated city of San Francisco, has grown beyond all account since the discovery of the gold, and is still going ahead surprisingly; it is indeed a splendid city, and well worthy of the name of “Queen of the Pacific.” &quot;Forefather’s day,” was duly celebrated by the “New England Society,” in this city, by an oration and dinner. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years day, were generally celebrated. This being the &quot;game season” the markets abound in all kinds of game, from a grizzly bear, down to a squirrel. Ducks, geese, &amp;c., especially abound, and being so plenty they are cheap; “Mallard” ducks selling at $1.00 per pair, which is as cheap as fresh beef. Green fruit, such as apples, pears, oranges, &amp;c., are plenty in the markets, and turnips, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, &amp;c., are brought in every morning, fresh from the gardens. The new grass started springing up with the first rains in December, and all the hill sides are now green; yet we have had some pretty cold weather lately for California. The morning I left Sacramento, ice an inch thick stood in the mud puddles on the levee, and the ground was considerably frozen. There have also been heavy falls of snow in the mining region; much rain has also fallen, but more is required to work the mines properly in many locations. I have no more to write at present, so wishing all a &quot;happy new year,&quot; I remain,</p><p>Yours,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock16.jpg
Rock17,"<p>No. XVII.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>San Francisco, Jan. 18, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>The principal topic of interest in this city at present is the trial of Charles Cora for the murder of Gen. Wm. H. Richardson on the evening of Nov. 5th. This trial has occupied about two weeks thus far, and the Jury in the case was yesterday discharged, being unable to agree upon a verdict; they stood ten for conviction and two for acquittal. </p><p>Cora and Richardson had had some dispute together a few evenings previously, but it was supposed to have been amicably adjusted, and they were seen walking arm in arm but a few minutes before the fatal deed was committed. They were next seen in front of Fox &amp; O'Connor's store, near Montgomery street. Cora was pushing Richardson into the doorway of the store, holding a pistol to his breast, and Richardson was heard to exclaim, &quot;do not shoot me! I am unarmed!&quot; but the next instant the pistol was discharged and he fell a corpse upon the pavement, shot through the heart. Cora left at once and passed up the street, but before he had an opportunity to effect his escape he was arrested by a policeman and taken at once to prison. Two Derringer pistols were found in his pockets, one of them just discharged. </p><p>Gen. Richardson was the United States Marshall here, and had many friends; and such a murder, committed in the very heart of the community, naturally created much excitement. Inflammatory speeches were made, and the bell of the &quot;Vigilance Committee&quot; was heard to toll; but nevertheless the prisoner was allowed to remain in the hands of the proper officers. </p><p>Cora was a gambler by profession, and has also many friends and plenty of money at his command; therefore all that friends and money can do has been and is being done to clear him if possible and screen him from the just vengeance of the outraged laws. One person is already under arrest for attempting to bribe one of the Jury, and the principal witnesses on the part of the defense are strongly suspected to be hired by the friends of Cora, and his counsel are of the very ablest in this state. Cora also has a mistress who is very much attached to him, and she is using every exertion to clear him. She has plenty of money and uses it with an unsparing hand. Whether money and friends are to triumph over law and justice in this case also, as in hundreds of others, will be shown in the sequel, but thus it is here in California. With us none but the poor, friendless, moneyless are punished. With us, the fashionable rogue runs but little risk, and the moneyed villain snaps his finger at the Judge, scorns the law, laughs at the Jury, and goes free. There are some exceptions, but the history of trials and of crime heretofore here, has little to make us proud. If a man be rich, he can commit any act he please, with a very fair prospect of escaping any punishment. It may be that his money will not buy the Jury, nor corrupt the Judge, suborn witnesses, nor silence prosecuting officers and citizens; but it will employ counsel who will do anything which the law can be so tortured as to appear to allow, or the Judge be weak enough to permit.</p><p>Some quibble or other, which he should kick out of consideration instantly, and its proposer out of court for the next similar offence, is pretty certain to be used and allowed to weigh, as if it were law and justice. Technical quibbles are the sum and substance of our law practice, especially upon criminal trials, and through them the greatest rascals, having plenty of money, escape punishment. It is not so in any other part of the United States, where civilized people and civilized laws are acknowledged as a rule of action, the courts are expected to enforce the laws, or apply the penalties for their violation. But here! Heaven help us! what do trials amount to? Simply to fees for lawyers, trouble for witnesses, cost for the County, and avoidance of punishment for the criminal. Indeed it is a notorious fact, that more <em>justice</em> has been meted out to criminals by what is commonly called &quot;Lynch law,” than has ever been by the civil law. Civil law would be effective enough, if it were only faithfully administered, but it is not; therefore it is that the people are so often compelled to take into their own hands the administration of the laws. The “Vigilance Committee&quot; of San Francisco, composed of over a thousand of our most respectable merchants and citizens, who have struck terror into the hearts of evil-doers in times past, still exist in full organization, and depend upon it, they are watching closely, every movement in the Cora trial. In this state during the past year there has been nine executions according to the statute law, and during the same period, there were forty-eight Lynch executions. These last include eight Mexicans who were Lynched for being participants in the Rancherie tragedy, of which I gave you an account a few months since.</p><p>By the foregoing remarks, I would not be understood by any means, to advocate the universal application of Lynch law, but to show some of the reasons why it has been resorted to so much here. The promptitude of the people to take the efficient administration of the laws into their own hands, has been, and still is, the grand terror of all &quot;rascals and those who disregard the laws of the land,” and but for this, California would have been long ere now, completely overrun by bandits, assassins and murderers, of the deepest dye. </p><p>J. Neely Johnson, the new (K.N.) governor of this state, was inaugurated in due form at Sacramento, on the 9th inst., and they had a ball in the evening, which is said to have been a magnificent affair. </p><p>Much rain has fallen lately, and there is plenty of water in the mines now. The miners complain of a great deal of snow and ice, and say the season is unusually cold.</p><p>During the past year, the passengers arriving by sea at San Francisco, were 31,379; and those departing, were 22,898, being an increase for the state of 8,861 persons. </p><p>The Indian war in Oregon and northern California, is being prosecuted with vigor, notwithstanding the severity of the season, and several companies of U.S. troops have just arrived here, en route for Oregon. The Indians are evidently determined not to be driven to abandon their ancient homes and hunting grounds, without a desperate struggle. But they are fast fading away before the ever advancing step of the pale face, and this last hopeless struggle of their injured spirits, but serves to hasten the approaching time, when their race shall be among the things that were, and the “Great Spirit” shall have called all his “red children” home to himself. </p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock17.jpg
Rock18,"<p>No. XVIII.<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, Feb. 3d, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>Not much news of interest to you has transpired during the past fortnight. We have had a great deal of rain, and the papers of the interior are rejoicing much at the great quantities of rain that have lately fallen, affording a full supply of water for all mining purposes. Nearly every gulsh has a tom-head of water running through it, and every ditch is filled to its utmost capacity. The Shasta <em>Republican</em>, says that the bountiful rains have given such an intense impetus to mining operations, that gold dust is being now brought into town for sale in much greater quantities than coin can be obtained to purchase it; but this difficulty will be of course obviated, just as soon as specie can be transported from below.</p><p>All along the base of the foot hills of the Sierra Nevada, and in Yolo and Solano counties especially, are vast fields of wild oats, which at this season of the year are just springing up fresh and green, affording feed for myriads of wild geese, deer, and antelope; and numerous hunting parties thereabouts, are taking advantage of the &quot;game season,” and slaughtering by the wholesale. Some hunt for the pleasure of hunting, but more make a regular business of it, and hunt for the profit. They take their game mostly to Sacramento or Stockton for sale, or for shipment to San Francisco. I see it stated in one of the papers, that one of these parties lately killed <em>one hundred and nineteen geese at three shots</em>. This is said to be a fact, but so, it is &quot;murder most fowl,&quot; and walking into geese with a perfect looseness. I think they must have used blunderbusses, or young howitzers.</p><p>“In common with other mountains containing rich auriferous deposits, it is composed of lava, or basalt, resting on ancient ground, and other depositions from water. Its height above the surface of the surrounding country, varies, owing principally to the variation of the country, and not its own; but it may be said to be from one to five hundred feet in height. On its top, it is level almost as a floor, only descending with much uniformity to the westward, at the rate of about twenty-five feet to the mile. Its width varies in different places, but its general width is about a sixth of a mile. But its most remarkable peculiarity is, that throughout its entire length, which is some fifteen or twenty miles, it winds and curves with other mountains in exact resemblance to the meanderings of a large river; just as it would if it had been once disgorged, a moulten, firey flood, from some old burning Sierra volcano, and rushed down the channel of some vast river, bearing on, and mingling in with its mighty current, quantities of rocks, pebbles, and sand, filling up the whole bed of the river, and then cooling down into a solid moveless mass. Afterwards we must suppose the surrounding country by floods and storms, in the course of ages, to have washed away, till the once river of lava, now stands high above the region around, with precipitous sides, a Table Mountain. Recent reports from the Volcano of the Hawaiian Islands, tells us that the last summer, the lava there, has thus flowed, winding as a river for fifty miles, so doubtless Table Mountain was formed.”</p><p>The above remarks on the conformation of this now famous mountain, are the most reasonable and intelligent of any I have yet heard entertained in regard to it. There are some now in Plymouth, who, as well as ourself, can well recollect its singularly level appearance, from which it derived its name, and the round lava stones upon its level top which were so difficult to pick up, owing to their adherence to the surface. </p><p>By means of long tunnels, run under this lava, to strike the deposit of gravel in the old river bed, hundreds of sanguine, eager miners are expecting to realize their fortune, but still, probably the channel of this ancient river, like the channels of modern ones, must, and will be, in many places immensely rich, and in other places exceedingly poor; and no doubt as has been the experience thus far in many places, thousands of dollars will be expended in reaching the old bed, where hundreds will not be taken out. Singular petrifactions have been met with in many of these tunnels, consisting of various kinds of wood, large bones, teeth, &amp;c. </p><p>The Mariposa <em>Gazette</em>, says that a fight is about to come off at Bear Valley, between two factions of the Chinese, who are said to have assembled in hundreds on either side. The Gazette thus humorously continues: --</p><p>&quot;As we understand the arrangements, the affair is to be a sort of collective duel. A line is to be drawn, and at the time agreed upon for the fight, the belligerents will assemble on both sides. At an agreed signal the “fout” will begin. No firearms are to be admitted or allowable in the tournament. The weapons to be used are fashioned out of cold iron, according to the taste of each individual warrior. </p><p>The favorite weapon, seems to be a corkscrew, on a large scale, which by dexterous handling, is screwed into the &quot;rice-bag&quot; of an opponent, who is then pulled across the line, and effectually pucker-stoppled. Another weapon is a large knife or rather cleaver, a fair blow with which, would split a Chinaman from the top of his head to the bottom of his bread-basket. All the blacksmiths about Mariposa, are engaged in manufacturing their weapons, and the feud is a source of profit to them at least. The Chinese keep dark as to the particular day of the fight, on account of interruption; for they went to the District Attorney, Judge Daly, requesting him to shed the light of his countenance approvingly upon the arrangements; but the Judge told them he would hang every long-tailed, mother's son of them that was caught in any such performance, which was discouraging, Other councillors, and they are very numerous too, advise them to fight, and that no notice will be taken of it by the authorities.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock18.jpg
Rock19,"<p>No. XIX.<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, Feb. 19<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>One of the principal topics of interest here since my last, has been the reported discovery of rich gold mines at San Antonio, just across the bay from this city, only some nine or ten miles distant. A great excitement was raised about them a little more than a week ago, and they were said to be just discovered by some Frenchmen, while digging a well. As a matter of course, the rush to the “new diggings&quot; was tremendous. Picks, pans, and shovels, were in great demand, and people of all professions, from commission merchants down to scalawags, and dock loafers, all took passage on the ferry boat, paying their fifty cents each, for the privilege of being ferried across to the land of promise. The boat went crowded each trip, and for a time the ferry proprietors coined money. On the new &quot;placer&quot; hundreds of claims were staked out for miles in extent. Meetings were held on the ground, and laws, rules and regulations made, one of which was that &quot;no person shall hold more than one claim, which shall be but sixty feet square.&quot; This was to &quot;prevent monopoly,” and was unanimously adopted. </p><p>The excitement is now over; and the Jews, Gentiles, scalawags and dock loafers, have most all come back, reporting the &quot;rich diggings&quot; to be a &quot;humbug,&quot; and a &quot;perfect take in.” I have seen several intelligent people well conversant with mines and mining, who have lately visited the place, and who also pronounce it a humbug. Gold has long been known to exist thereabouts, but in so very small quantities that mining for it never could be remunerative, and in all probability this great excitement about the &quot;new diggings,” first originated in the fertile brains of the proprietors of the Contra Costa ferry. They have made a “good thing&quot; out of it certainly, and therein gained what they aimed at.</p><p>A lively discussion has been lately carried on through the columns of the California Chronicle, in relation to the first discovery of gold within the borders of this state, and as to whether it was publicly known, that gold mines existed in Upper California, previously to their discovery by Mr. Marshall in 1848; and it has been established that a gold lacer was known, and being worked by several persons near the Mission of San Fernando, in the southern portion of the state from 1840 to 1846, but nevertheless the grand discovery of gold in the northern portion of California, was made by Mr. Marshall, on the 19th of January, 1848, while digging the race of Sutter’s Mill, and the supposition that Col. Fremont was aware of the existence of gold here, previous to Marshall’s discovery, receives no credit here. Many have been of the opinion that he did know of it from the fact of his acquiring the great ranch of “Las Mariposas,&quot; situated in the southern part of the mining region, but this is shown to have been obtained by accident. </p><p>On the 5th of this month, the steamer “Belle,” exploded her boiler on the river, eleven miles above Sacramento City, killing and wounding some thirty persons. The boat is a complete wreck and a total loss. The cause of this sad calamity is attributed to a defective boiler, and no blame is understood to be attached to the engineer.</p><p>On the 15th inst., we had a severe shock of an earthquake, more severe than has ever before been experienced by the &quot;oldest inhabitant.&quot; It occurred at twenty-three minutes past five in the morning, and lasted about half a minute. It commenced with a loud rumbling noise, as of the passing of a heavy wagon along the street, and the oscillations seemed to be about north and south. The walls of several brick buildings were cracked, and the heavy cornice on the north side of Goodwin &amp; Co's buildings, corner of Front and Oregon streets, were thrown down to the north. Everybody was awakened by the shock, and many ran out into the streets in various and interesting stages of dishabille. Several of the inmates of the Rassette House, Montgomery Block, and of several of the other largest brick buildings of the city, ran out into the street. In some houses the plastering was shaken down. None of the large bells were rung, but several door bells were heard to ring. Many timid persons were very much frightened, and some talk of leaving the state, for fear of another, and more destructive convulsion of nature.</p><p>The Indian war in Oregon is still being vigorously prosecuted, and the Indians do not seem inclined to <br />“give in,” till they have been whipped satisfactorily.</p><p>The Mariposa <em>Gazette</em>, says that the &quot;fight&quot; which was to have come off among the Chinese in Bear Valley, has been indefinitely postponed, owing to the exertions of a few Americans, but nevertheless, full preparations have been made on both sides, in the way of weapons &amp;c., and in all probability they will have a small scrimmage yet in a private way, as the belligerents on both sides are evidently anxious for a &quot;muss.&quot; These long-tailed, moon-eyed &quot;Celestials,&quot; are a queer set, and cut up some droll capers sometimes in a warlike way, but the mortality attendant upon their “fights,” is seldom very great; and as they appear to deem an occasional &quot;row&quot; among themselves, beneficially indispensable to their well being, why, &quot;go in lemons.&quot;</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock19.jpg
Rock20,"<p>No. XX<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1856. </p><p>FRIEND ROCK: </p><p>&quot;Washington's birth day&quot; was duly celebrated here and was made a holiday by most of our population. Several of the military and fire companies paraded, salutes were fired, all the shipping in the bay displayed their numerous flags, and in the evening there were balls given at several places, which were all<strong> </strong>fully attended. During the afternoon some of the fire engines tried their aquatic powers in the squirting line, to the satisfaction of numerous spectators. A splendid &quot;Hunneman&quot; engine, just built for the navy yard at Mare Island, was also thoroughly tested and proved to be A No. 1. But the feature of the day was the parade of the &quot;Wallace Guards,&quot; a new volunteer corps, this being their first public appearance in this city. They were dressed in the regular Highland costume, and made a most picturesque and romantic appearance in their &quot;tartan array&quot; of high-plumed bonnets, plaid, kilts, &amp;c., and as this costume involved the exposure of some forty or fifty pairs of bare legs, the balmy winter breezes of this locality were rather more suited to their parade than would have been one of our down east &quot;nor westers&quot; at this season of the year. They were accompanied by a splendid brass band, which discoursed most eloquent and appropriate music, and among the many Scottish pieces which they played, I recognized &quot;The Campbells are coming,&quot; &quot;The bonny breast-knots,&quot; &quot;Highland Laddie,&quot; &quot;Comin' thro' the rye,&quot; and other favorites. Not the least novelty of the occasion was an ancient &quot;Highland Piper&quot; in costume, who occupied an honorary position just behind the brass band, and at intervals he gave a specimen of his natural capabilities on the Scotch bagpipes, to the no small edification of the numerous and admiring crowd that followed through all the principal streets of the city. They terminated the exercises of the day with a splendid ball at the International Hotel, which was very numerously attended and highly spoken of by the participants. </p><p>In honor of the day, as well as to signalize the completion of the road, the Sacramento Valley Railroad, was thrown open free to the public on the 22d, and the Officers and Directors of the Company together with a number of invited guests from this city an Sacramento, made a pleasure excursion over the road to its termination, at the new town of Folsom, on the American river, twenty-six miles from Sacramento, and participated in a dinner and ball, in honor of the occasion. This is the first railroad in California, and owing to the level nature of the section of country which it traverses, it has been thus far completed at a cost which would not be considered heavy in any other country, where labor is much cheaper than it is here.</p><p>Late accounts from Puget Sound ad Northern Oregon, represent the Indians there, as suing for peace, but other accounts just received from Northern California and Southern Oregon, are very different indeed. There, they are in arms, and seem to be bent on the total extermination of all the whites. They have attacked and killed the farmers, and burned all the houses on the south side of Rogue's River, as well as killed nearly all of a small company of volunteers. About thirty settlers and their families have been killed. The inhabitants about the mouth of the river, have all retreated to the north side, where they have a small fort. At Crescent City, the excitement is great and much hard fighting is anticipated, they have petitioned the Governor of the state to authorize them to call out as Volunteers, all who are capable of bearing arms. The Indians are numerous, brave and merciless. There is no time to spare, and whatever is to be done, demands to be, and probably will be done by our Legislature at once, as the exigency of the case demands.</p><p>The investigation of the affairs of the great banking firm of Adams &amp; Co. in this state has occupied much public attention of late and many interesting financial &quot;operations&quot; are being brought to light in relation to the failure of that house. Mr. A. A. Cohen, who was appointed receiver after the suspension, is now and has been on trial for some time, charged with the embezzlement of the funds of the firm. He attempted, a few weeks ago, to escape on one of the steamers, by secreting himself among the machinery, but was detected and brought back and is now kept where he can be easily found when wanted. H. M. Naglee, Esq., has been appointed receiver in his place and Cohen required to transfer to him all moneys, accounts, books &amp;c., received while in the capacity of receiver. This, Cohen professes to have done, but the books containing the accounts of the transactions of the firm immediately previous to suspension were missing, so that the amount of funds which were spirited away by the absconded partner, J. C. Woods, as well as by the presumed peculations of Cohen and others , could not be ascertained. Much search, of course, has been made for the missing books, but without success, until last Thursday afternoon, the 28th ult., when quite an excitement was created by the singular discovery of two of the missing books. They were picked up floating in the surf at North Beach, in the northerly part of this city. They were enclosed in a canvass bag and from appearance had evidently not been long in the water. They were the &quot;General Ledger&quot; and &quot;General Cash Book,&quot; and their being discovered so opportunely just at this time puts quite a new aspect on several of the points in the case, although some important leaves have been torn out of each of them. By whose rascality these books were thus made way with is a question which remains to be solved. The important books still missing are the Bills Receivable book, the General Ledger balance book and the Paying Teller's &quot;Cash Settlements,&quot; which last is of great importance. Should these books also happen to &quot;turn up,&quot; the whole of the rascality of some of those connected with this house here will be brought to light, and woe be to those on whose necks the sword of justice falls. </p><p>By the by, speaking of money matters, I must tell you a little anecdote of Mr. B - an enterprising individual who lately arrived here from Massachusetts. But we will first premise that you are cognizant of the fact that copper coin is unknown in the currency of California, and a copper &quot;cent” is of no value whatever and scarcely ever to be met with here. Well, on landing on the wharf, he hired a drayman to take his baggage round to the place of business of a friend in the city, for which the drayman charged him the usual fee of half a dollar. B-- thrust his hand into his pocket and drew forth a “quarter of a dollar and three copper cents,&quot; which he offered to the drayman, saying this was all the money he had. The accommodating drayman took the “quarter,” but rejected the &quot;coppers&quot; with an injured air, remarking “what the d---1 do you s’pose I want of them things.&quot; But our friend B--, being bent on doing the benevolent thing, pressed him to accept of them, saying, &quot;here, take ‘em, I don't want 'em, you're welcome to ‘em, take 'em.” The drayman couldn't stand it any longer, but jumping upon his dray, he drove off, looking over his shoulder at our friend B-- with a surprised and injured air, muttering, something about having a “soul above coppers.” One thing is certain, that the drayman never will forget &quot;the man with the three cents.&quot;</p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock20.jpg
Rock21,"<p>No. XXI.<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, March 18<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:</p><p>During the past month there has bat very little rain fallen, consequently the young grass was fast drying up, and the farming interest was beginning to suffer. All the newspapers from the interior, reported &quot;dry times&quot; there, and great consequent discontent among the miners, in regard to the weather. On the 14th inst, however, we had a glorious rain throughout the country; but more is needed soon, or the crops will turn out small this season. </p><p>Accounts from the mines, made frequent mention of mining accidents, whereby many a poor fellow is crushed to death by the caving of banks, tunnels, &amp;c. Such accidents are very frequent of late, and generally fatal; and fortunate indeed is he who is rescued from such a horrid death, and lives to tell the tale. In former years the gold was readily and plentifully found in the beds of the ravines, but now, these being worked out, the miners have to work in the banks, and in the bowels of the hills and mountains, hence the frequency of mining accidents now-a-days. The summer months in the mines are very dry; therefore the earth is baked hard and firm, and there is comparatively little danger in working in tunnels and under high banks of earth; but when by the heavy winter rains, these banks become saturated and heavy, they are liable to slide and cave in; and wo be unto the luckless individual who happens to be in the way. </p><p>The jury in the case of A.A. Cohen, for the embezzlement of the funds of Adams &amp; Co., in their verdict, find the amount of funds which passed into the said Cohen's hands while in the capacity of Receiver for Adams &amp; Co., to be $269,046,18. He had accounted to the present Receiver for $124,803,55. He is now required to account for the deficiency, which he'd much rather not if he could conveniently avoid it, but the people have become tired of these frequent swindling failures, and are having them looked into, and investigated rather more closely than is agreeable to some of those financiering swindlers.</p><p>Yesterday was St. Patrick's day, and the Irish in this city, acting upon the assumed hypothesis that “St Patrick was just as good a man as ever the Fourth of July was,&quot; celebrated the anniversary of him that made the snakes and frogs “vamoose” from “swate ould Ireland.” In the morning a procession was formed, of natives of the Green Isle, and marched to St. Mary's Cathedral, where an address was delivered, and high mass was said; after which the procession, bearing banners and emblems, moved through many of the principal streets of the city, accompanied by a brass band. The festivities of the occasion wound up in the evening with balls, and social gatherings at various places, and the bleared eyes and broken noses of this morning, attest that they passed off &quot;harmoniously.”</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock21.jpg
Rock22,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXIV.<br />San Francisco, May 4, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:</p><p>I have just received a letter from an old companion of mine in the diggings, complaining most bitterly of the hard winter they have had up there. The first part of the winter he says was so cold that they were greatly troubled with ice and snow, making mining much more difficult and disagreeable than it naturally is, and latterly it has been like summer there, hot and dry, and the supply of water in many localities had entirely failed, therefore he seems to think the mines have been less productive thus far this winter, than formerly; they are however still anxiously and hopefully looking forward to the &quot;spring rains&quot; for a supply of the much needed element, and meanwhile employ themselves at &quot;prospecting,&quot; and hunting. The snows have driven myriads of deer and other game down from the more elevated portion of the Sierras, affording great sport for the hunters, and occasioning great mortality among the &quot;venison.&quot; But speaking of hunting, reminds me of a droll adventure of that sort in which I was a participant, and the very recollection of it even now makes my sides ache. </p><p>It was in the winter of '51 near the lower &quot;Rich Gulch&quot; of the Calaveras. Three of us had made all necessary preparations for a &quot;fire hunt&quot; one night, and accordingly a couple of hours after dark, we sallied forth, &quot;armed and equipped&quot; as the occasion required. Sam, walked ahead with a pole over his shoulder, about ten feet long, at the top of which was a sort of basket, made of old iron hoops, and filled with blazing pine knots, which cast a strong light on every object within fifty yards of us. </p><p>I was &quot;fireman,&quot; and with my gun in my hand, followed close at his heels, with a sack, filled with pine knots, slung across my shoulder, with which to replenish the fire. Billy L--- being the most experienced hunter, was the “director&quot; of the party, and followed immediately behind me, with his gun, ready to massacre the first misfortunate &quot;venison&quot; that should become revealed to us. Now in &quot;fire hunting,&quot; the deer and other animals are detected by the &quot;shining&quot; of their eyes, from the fact that when they see a bright light approaching them in the dark, they do not run, but being attracted by the light, they stand stock still, and gaze intently at it, their eyes presenting a peculiarly luminous appearance, and affording a fine mark to shoot at. They will thus stand until the light has approached to within a short distance of them, near enough for them to perceive the hunters underneath the light, when the spell is broken, and they are off, if not detained by loss of life. Well, we were not more than half a mile from camp, and preceding carefully along, with as little noise as possible, when on a sudden, Sam stopped, and eagerly pointed towards a large oak tree some forty yards off on our left, and there sure enough we perceived a pair of bright eyes near the trunk of the tree, peering curiously at the light. In another instant, bang! went both guns; the eyes disappeared at once; and something went rattling and bounding off at a great rate down the steep rocky hill side. We stood and listened, and for some time heard the rattling of the animals hoofs, as he made the best of his way for “parts unknown.” We went to the tree, and by the light examined the tracks and found them to be those of a good sized deer. The trunk of the tree was thickly peppered with buck-shot, and some short, grayish hair, and a few drops of blood, which we found in his trail, showed that he did not escape unscathed; but from the way he had made off, we concluded he was not much hurt, and that it would be useless to follow him, so we reloaded, and marched on as before. Billy was a very excitable disposition, and priding himself on being A No. 1 shot, his temper was considerably ruffled, and he swore by the &quot;big gun of Athlome,” that he &quot;never heard of such bad shooting&quot; -- knew he <em>must</em> have hit the deer, and that it was my shot that had peppered the tree so badly. For two hours more, we hunted cautiously along, halting ever and anon to replenish the torch fire, but without seeing any more sign of game. Meanwhile the black, heavy sky overhead, and the rising south-east wind, as it moaned through the leafless trees, told of an approaching storm, and soon after retracing our steps homeward big drops of rain began to descend urging us to hasten to the shelter of our snug cabins. Soon the rain poured down in torrents, wetting us thro' to the skin. Poor Billy! how he did curse the luck, and the more we laughed at him the louder he cursed. We had much difficulty in keeping our fire-light from being extinguished, and to stop often under the lee of some big tree to replenish it, that we might see our way along. -- The quartz ledges running north and south, and other indications, directed us on the right course towards home, and just as we had got within a few hundred yards of camp - Billy cursing his luck louder, and feeling more uncomfortable than ever - all at once Sam with the big torch halted, and with quick whisper and sudden gesture he pointed just about forty yards ahead, to where a pair of luminous great eyes were plainly perceptible. Billy was on tiptoe - we should get a deer yet - not such bad luck after all, he thought. He gave the signal, and both our guns snapped at once; the caps were wet. We quickly recapped, and snapped again; the powder in the tubes was wet. Billy was in perfect agony. He applied to his powder horn, but the rain had leaked in and wet all his powder. - There were those two big round eyes still staring at us, and Billy almost distracted. My powder was dry, and we pricked in some of it into the tubes, but no go; snap! went the caps again. Billy fairly hopped with rage. Again he reprimed, and but on a fresh cap, but just as he was about to draw sight along the barrel, a sound as of Gabriel's trumpet, and a score of fish-horns combined, broke forth from about the two eyes, it being the most sonorously unmistakable bray of <em>Billy's own donkey</em>, who was quietly grazing upon the hill side, until disturbed by our approach. This was too much. Billy boiled over. Snap! went the cap again, and if the gun had gone off, Billy's donkey would have got &quot;fits.&quot; As it was, Billy &quot;clubbed musket&quot; and at him; but the long eared quadruped seemed to understand what was coming, for he quickly turned, and letting both heels fly at his master, away he went clattering down a small ravine and Billy after him screaming like a trooper. Sam and I, stood and held our sides with laughter. Poor Sam got so weak that he dropped the pole, and scattered the fire far and near. We picked up a fire-brand which lighted us to camp, where Billy arrived shortly afterwards. He soon saw that he must enjoy the joke and laugh it off as well as possible. He tried to get us &quot;not to tell about it,” but 'twas of no use; the story was too good to keep; others must enjoy it as well as ourselves, and to this day he has always borne the nickname of &quot;Donkey Bill.”</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT</p>",public://rock/Rock22.jpg
Rock23,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXIII.<br />San Francisco, April 19, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: </p><p>Between the ninth and the fifteenth of this month considerable quantities of rain fell; reinvigorating the suffering crops, giving a fresh supply of water for mining purposes, and diffusing new life through all branches of trade and occupation. The interior papers comment happily upon the fresh impetus which this generous rain has given to all mining operations, and make frequent mention of many a good “strike,” and of numerous pounds of the yellow metal which are daily being “taken out” in the various mining localities. In some places, water cannot be had to wash the dirt, except when it rains; but in most parts of the ravines a supply is obtained by means of the numerous canals and ditches, which traverse the mountains in all directions. Most of the smaller ditches bring the water from some large gulch or creek, which runs dry in summer, but when supplied with water, and swollen by the winter rains, they afford a supply of water through the ditches for some time. The largest canals are cut from the main rivers, and generally supply water the year round to the principal mining localities. This system of canals has worked a wonderful change in the appearance of the mining region within the last few years, and the poor unsophisticated Digger Indian, now gazes with wonder and surprise to see the rivers leaving their ancient beds, and winding round the tops of the lofty hills and mountains, crossing deep ravines by means of immense aqueducts suspended high in air upon trestle work, and looking at a distance, like so many big spider webs. The Calaveras being a small river, and hot heading so high up in the mountains as the other rivers, used to dry up entirely, in the dry season, and rise again at the approach of winter. In the fall of 1851, I walked up the bed of this river for a mile or more, there being no water to be seen; but that cannot well be done again, for canals from the neighboring rivers now empty into it and supply it with water the year round. There is an old Indian legend connected with the Calaveras which may not be uninteresting to some of your readers, therefore I will here relate it. </p><p>&quot;Many, many moons ago,&quot; and long before the covetous eye of the ever intruding &quot;pale face&quot; had gazed upon this happy country, a powerful tribe of Indians inhabited the wooded banks and fertile bottom lands of this river. Their hunting grounds were broad and well stocked with myriads of fat deer and other game of all kinds in plenty, and the hunter never returned home to his wigwam at night empty handed, but loaded with game killed with his keen arrows. Their chief was the great &quot;El-kar-wa,&quot; so called from his great bravery and sagacity, and led by him they feared not the powerful neighboring tribes of the Mokelumne and Stanislaus. With the latter they were at peace, but the Mokelumne Indians had long been their deadliest foes and many a bloody battle had they fought together. Hunting parties often encountered parties of their enemies and numerous and sanguinary were their skirmishes. One day El-kar-wa, accompanied by many of his principal friends and an only daughter, was out on a grand hunt. They were very successful, and at length, tired with their sport, they were resting under the shade of a spreading oak-tree. The friends of the chief were talking and laughing over the incidents of the chase, and by his side sat his well beloved daughter, gladdening the heart of the stern old chief with her ringing laugh and sunny smile. Her name was &quot;Le-wanna-ka,&quot; which, let us presume for romance sake, meant Bounding Fawn, and also that she was a very pretty young &quot;Bright Alfarata&quot; with &quot;jetty locks in wavy tresses flowing,&quot; although the feminine specimens of the genus &quot;Digger&quot; now extant hardly justify any such supposition. On a sudden the shrill war-whoop of the Mokelumne Indians rang in their ears and they were surprised by a large war-party of their foes. They sprang to their feet, fighting hand to hand with the enemy and as the heavy tomahawk of El-kar-wa sank deep into the skull of a Mokelumne warrior, with a faint cry Le-wanna-ka fell dead at her father's feet, with the deadly arrow piercing her bosom. The old chief gave a howl of agony at the sight and fought with redoubled and desperate fury, but their enemies were too numerous and powerful for them, and still fighting like tigers, they bore away the body of Le-wanna-ka. Late that evening they arrived home, tired and wounded. Runners were sent out at once and at sunrise the next morning all the warriors of the tribe were assembled before the camp of El-kar-wa. A pile of oak logs was gathered, on which the body of Le-wanna-ka was laid and burned with due honor and great ceremony, according to the custom of the tribe, and as the warriors with loud howls of grief danced madly around the flames, they brandished aloft their weapons and vowed deep and terrible vengeance on their enemies. The plans of El-kar-wa were soon unfolded to his men, and at the head of a hundred of his trustiest warriors he took the trail toward the Mokelumne. Half way between the two rivers, on a small plain, he saw a large body of the Mokelumne warriors advancing towards him, upon which he seemed alarmed and beat a retreat, followed by the entire body of the enemy in full cry, who all madly pursued him as he fled over hill and dale with his trusty warriors until at length he lead them down a steep, dark ravine whose rocky sides, crowned with dense chaparral, rose bold and precipitous as it descended towards the river; when, on a sudden, near the foot of the ravine, El-kar-wa and his braves turned and, with a loud whoop of defiance, faced their foes. That war-whoop was echoed and re-echoed from every rock and from the bold, rocky sides of the ravine. The warrior-braves of El-kar-wa commanded every point, and their foes discovered too late that they had been led into a deadly ambuscade. Clouds of arrows and showers of stones and heavy rocks came crashing down from either side. They could not retrace their steps, but utterly at the mercy of a merciless foe, they struggled to extricate themselves. Their only chance was to escape by the mouth of the ravine, and here they fought with the madness of desperation. A few only effected their escape. Many were killed by arrows in crossing the river. This unequal contest was soon ended, and hundreds of reeking scalps were the trophies of the victors. The heads of the bodies were then all cut off and thrown down among the rocks by the river's side, but the bodies were afterwards burned. The floods of successive winters washed the fleshless skulls of the unfortunate Mokelumne warriors down along the river's course, and from this circumstance it is that in after years the river received the name which it now bears: &quot;Rio de Calaveras,&quot; --River of Skulls. </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.   </p>",public://rock/Rock23.jpg
Rock24,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXIV.<br />San Francisco, May 4, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:</p><p>Within the past two weeks, the grading of the San Francisco and Mission Dolores railroad has been commenced and is going, ahead rapidly. It will be only some two and a half or three miles in length, and as the route is over low ground and through sand hills, the grading is easy, and will be soon completed. There are two plank roads now connecting the two places, over which omnibuses run alternately, every half hour during the day; but it is expected that the railroad will soon supercede these in a measure. The right of way was secured, and the grading commenced, before the books were opened for the subscription of stock, or the grading contractor had given any bonds for the fulfillment of his contract. The project has been &quot;talked off&quot; for some time; and now all at once -California like- it is rushed into, and the first assessment of five per cent, on each share, is now being called in. This road will probably at some future time be extended to San Jose, some fifty miles. </p><p>A stranger in California, visiting; San Francisco, would be greatly surprised at the display and pompousness of most of the funerals here. Most especially is it so with the funerals of any member of the fire department. Splendid hearses, heavily hung in black, with waving plumes, followed by long trains of magnificent carriages, and procession of mourners on foot, wearing appropriate emblems of mourning, the gay flags of all the numerous engine houses displayed at half mast, and the solemn toll of the bells, characterize the mournful occasion. But a short time ago, a San Francisco fireman was not deemed to have been buried “right,” unless he was followed to his last resting place, by all his fellows, dressed in full uniform, with their &quot;machine,&quot; torches, banner, &amp;c., all hung with crape, and escorted by a fine band of music, performing the appropriate airs. A short time since, a German musician, of some note, died here, and was followed to his grave by a long procession of his numerous friends and countrymen, and preceded by more than sixty of the best musicians in this city, discoursing the most eloquent, mournful and impressive music.</p><p>The number of men who meet with violent deaths in California, must be considerably more than a thousand a year, at the rate these deaths are occurring here at resent. The number resulting from mining causalities, is enormously large, and will doubtless continue to increase, in proportion as the heavy and dangerous mining operations now in vogue, are extended and adopted; and those killed in this manner, are the very bone and sinew of the state. California could much better afford to lose another class of men. It is said that the deaths in the mining region, by banks and tunnels caving, exceed at this time the homicide calendar. Many of these distressing causalities are the results of carelessness, and want of judgment and foresight; but many also are unavoidable. </p><p>The withdrawal of the steamers from the Nicaragua line, has of course diverted the great mass of travel to the Panama route, and the last steamer, - the <em>Sonora</em> - was so crowded, that the U.S. Marshal would not let her take her departure, until he had counted the passengers, and measured the vessel; when finding no excess of passengers, he allowed her to proceed. </p><p>By the arrival of the steamer <em>John L. Stephens</em>, we have full accounts of the bloody conflict at Panama, on the 15th of April, between the passengers and natives, in which some thirty or more of the passengers from New York were killed or wounded. But ere this reaches you, you have doubtless had the full particulars of this outrageous massacre. It seems the natives had it pretty much their own way, killing and robbing whom they thought proper, plundering the expresses, and doing whatever damage they saw fit. But hold on; the steamer of tomorrow will carry a load of passengers down there that they will find it un-safe to molest. A great number of miners are going home at this season by every steamer, and they are always fully prepared to give any of these villains a test of the qualities of the Colt's revolver, or the Bowie knife. They are a rough set to encounter, and have seen by sad experience, the prudence as well as the necessity, of being always ready and prepared against any emergency when among the treacherous mongrel Spanish race. And the passengers by this steamer, being forewarned, will be doubly forearmed. Ah! what a pity that we had not a frigate <em>Cyane</em> lying there, to protect our interests at that point, and teach these Panama thieves the same salutary lesson that she taught at Graytown not long ago. And will the representatives of Uncle Sam, at Washington, look upon all this with their usual Dutch stricism? or will they lay down their pipe, rise from their easy chair, and show to all foreign nations that we are yet <em>Americans</em>, and will not be trampled under foot with impunity ? Whatever may have been the trivial cause of the first attack, does that justify the wholesale butchery of the Americans which followed? Were the natives justified in firing repeated volleys of musketry upon the defenseless passengers as they stood crowded and huddled together in the railroad depot, regardless of the heartrending shrieks of the women, and the cries of innocent children? It remains to be seen, whether our phlegmatic government will take immediate and prompt steps in this matter, or permit as heretofore, Americans and American rights to be trampled upon and insulted with perfect impunity. Oh, that an “Old Hickory&quot; were once more at the helm of government, and that the great heart of the old hero again ruled the destinies of the American nation, ever ready to stand up for our rights, and prompt to redress our wrongs. Popular indignation here runs high, for among us now are wounded men and women, fresh from the bloody scene. Just let the home government say the word, and California, of her own accord, and at her own expense, would soon teach the thieving mongrel curs of Panama, a lesson of which they have long stood in actual need, and in less than six months annex to the United States about fifty miles of that territory, stretching from the Pacific to the Caribbean sea. That is just what is wanted, and the nations of the world would thank us for thus controlling the great “highway of nations,&quot; and ensuring peace and safety to the travelling millions. But let's wait and hear if Messrs. Pierce and Marcy will have anything to say in regard to this affair.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock24.jpg
Rock25,"<p>Our California Correspondent gives a very interesting and detailed account of the excitement in San Francisco, consequent upon the murder of James King. Read Ben Bolt’s letter.</p><p>From our California Correspondent.</p><p>No. XXV.</p><p>San Francisco, Monday May 19, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: </p><p>At the present writing, San Francisco is in a state of social revolution, and for the last few days business of all kinds has been brought to a standstill. I wrote you in one of my letters of a few months since, of the assassination of Gen. Richardson, the U.S. Marshal here, by Charles Cora, a gambler, and now I have to record another of those foul deeds of blood that ever and anon blot the page of California history. About 5 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon last, James King, of William, the editor of the Evening <em>Bulletin, </em>was going from the office of his paper to his residence, corner of Pacific and Powell streets, and when near the office of the Pacific Express Co., on Montgomery street, James P. Casey, editor of the Sunday <em>Times, </em>who had been standing there waiting, for the purpose, stepped up to him presenting a Colt's navy revolver at his breast, saying: - &quot;Draw and defend yourself,&quot; and immediately fired, before Mr. King could speak a word or draw a weapon. King put his hand to his breast, exclaiming, &quot;I am shot!&quot; and staggered into the Express Office, and sank into a chair just as Casey had cocked his pistol for another shot. Several people who were near witnesses of the attack immediately ran to the assistance of Mr. King, while the Police and others seized on Casey and hurried him off to the prison, and it was well that they did so, for in a very short space of time afterwards, a tremendous and excited crowd would have hung him at once to the nearest elevation convenient, if they could only have laid hands on him. </p><p>He was within six feet of Mr. King when he fired, and the fatal bullet entered the body about four inches above the left nipple of the breast, passing a little upward, and coming out at his back near the junction of the arm with the shoulder, inflicting it was thought a fatal wound, as an artery was supposed to be severed. He was in great pain and bled profusely, but continued to speak until 12 o'clock when morphine was administered, and at 1 o'clock he was in a stupor or slumber lying on a bed made upon the counter of the office. Mrs. King and another lady, Thomas S. King his brother, a few intimate friends and Drs. Toland, Gray and Hammond, remained with him during the night. </p><p>Immediately upon the occurrence of the tragedy, people began to run from all quarters. The news spread like wildfire through the city. The cry of fire was raised in the distance, and in fifteen or twenty minutes a large and highly excited crowd were gathered together at the corner of Washington and Montgomery streets, the scene of the tragedy. </p><p>Mr. King is a very popular man, especially among the masses of the people, and now that he was shot down in the public street in open day, by the notorious Casey, the frenzied excitement of the committee had no bounds. Voices were heard on all sides, crying &quot;hang him!&quot; &quot;Lynch him!&quot; &quot;where's the Vigilance Committee?!&quot; Everybody was talking in a loud voice and intensely excited manner. Some mounted in elevated situations and attempted to address the crowd, but the uproar was so tremendous that none could be heard. At length a rush was made to the prison to take Casey out and immediately hang him, but the Sheriff, in anticipation of this, was on hand with a strong force and repelled the crowd. Large crowds traversed the streets and gathered at various points till midnight, and even after, but were altogether too much excited to effect any sort of organization.</p><p>Meanwhile the Mayor ordered out all the Volunteer Infantry Companies of the city, under arms, to protect the law and quell the riot. The San Francisco Blues were the first to appear, and were stationed in front of the Jail, while the City Guards, Marion Rifles, Sarsfield Guards and the Continental Guards, soon arriving, were stationed inside and on top of the Jail. The mob in front were very violent and abusive, and threw sticks and dirt at the soldiers. The soldiers had empty muskets, but on loading with ball the crowd became considerably more respectful. A few only of each company turned out at the call of the Mayor, and these with much reluctance. On the following day - Thursday - the Vigilance Committee assembled at an early hour at 105 1-2 Sacramento street, to take into consideration the present state of affairs, and were in session all day and until a late hour at night. </p><p>As soon as it became publicly known that the Vigilance Committee had taken the matter in hand, the excitement in public died gradually away, for the people of San Francisco repose all confidence in this Committee. The attempted assassination very naturally was the theme of general conversation throughout the day, and business affairs seemed but little thought of. One sentiment seemed to prevail among all classes, and that was that the blood of the wounded man should be avenged. Cora who was also in the same Jail, was spoken of pretty freely, and all seemed to think it best to hang Casey, Cora and Bachus, all at the same time, and as soon as possible. Bachus was lately tried also for assassinating a man in the street. He shot him in the back while he was running from him, but by some quibbling among the lawyers and considerable monied influence, a verdict of manslaughter was returned and he was let off with a heavy fine and three years in the state prison - money shapes the law here. </p><p>Both battalions of the soldiery at the prison declined longer to serve as guard to the Jail, disbanded, resumed citizens dress, and will not again bear arms in this affair, even at the official call of the authorities. Telegraphic despatches were received from the interior, inquiring whether or not assistance was required to regulate the state of affairs here existing, and many came down from Sacramento and Stockton by the afternoon boats. </p><p>In Sacramento, a mass meeting was held in the evening (Thursday) before the Orleans Hotel, and a series of resolutions adopted, expressing the feelings of the people in regard to this sad affair, upholding the course which has ever been pursued by Mr. King in his editorial capacity, tendering to him their sympathies in his present affliction, and deeply condemning the would-be assassin Casey. </p><p>In view of the evident determination of the people to take some decided action and fearing that an attempt would be made to rescue the prisoner, the Mayor applied to the commander of a Revenue Cutter in the harbor to receive Casey on board for greater protection, but the request was denied, as the officers did not fancy the character of the guest sought to be thrust upon them. </p><p>After the military refused to protect the prison, that duty devolved on the Police, and the Mayor swore in several citizens to act as special police. They were mostly the friends of Casey. </p><p>The Vigilance Committee have continued in session almost night and day since they were first called together, and receive daily, large accessions to their numbers, swearing in new members, and Saturday evening they numbered five thousand of the very best men in the city, men of the first standing in society. They had a large number of doorkeepers and none were allowed to enter but citizens of unquestionably good character and respectability. They refused admission to many who were known to the community as gamblers and shoulder-strikers. All our leading men and most respectable merchants are members of this vast committee, and all sworn to act as the majority shall decide when the time for action arrives. The proceedings of their meetings are private, but seem to be conducted with great harmony and in a determined spirit, and whatever they conclude on they will certainly accomplish. </p><p>As soon as practicable, Mr. King was removed on a litter to Montgomery Block, and at the present he is much better and strong hopes are entertained of his ultimate recovery. Every half hour of the day a placard is posted up on the Bulletin board, announcing his situation in order to satisfy the constant eager inquiries concerning his health. </p><p>On Friday evening the Governor arrived from Sacramento, and finding, on consultation with his friends, that it would be foolish as well as useless to call out the forces to endeavor to counteract the action of the committee of the people, at one o'clock that night he was in conference with the Executive committee desiring to be informed as to the wishes and intentions of this vast combination. He found them cool, orderly and determined. He found it supported by the whole people, but more than all he found it was governed by a higher law - the law of self-defense by an outraged community. After a conference of several hours it was agreed that efforts should be made to induce the Sheriff to allow the Vigilance Committee to place a guard, composed of members of the committee, within the Jail, that the people might be assured of the safe custody of the prisoner. In accordance with this agreement the parties called at the Jail at 2 o'clock on Saturday morning, and after laying the matter before the Sheriff he agreed to the arrangement, providing that they should not seek to wrest the prisoner from his custody. In case the Committee of Vigilance should resolve upon such a course, they agreed to withdraw the guard, and restore matters as they found them. From that hour a delegation of members of the Committee were in constant attendance at the prison, being relieved every three or four hours by others delegated by the Vigilance Committee. </p><p>Yesterday - Sunday - was a day ever to be remembered in the annals of San Francisco. Serried ranks of armed citizens were in the public streets. Each countenance betrayed a fixed determination to avenge the wrongs of the innocent and no longer suffer the guilty to escape. It was a scene of which my inadequate pen can give but a poor description. In the morning the Vigilance Committee armed themselves and assembled at their various places of meeting. About 9 o'clock the guard of the Committee at the prison was withdrawn, and at 11 o'clock, in companies of a hundred each, they commenced marching to the Jail. They carried muskets with fixed bayonets, also side arms at their belts, and wore citizens dress. They were accompanied by mounted guards and headed by cool but resolute men. They were directed in their movements by a portion of the Executive Committee, who bore no weapons. </p><p>By 12 o'clock the streets, hill-sides and housetops in the vicinity of the Jail were crowded with the expectant masses of the people. Arriving at Broadway, on which the prison is situated, the armed detachments cleared the street and planted themselves in files on the south side of it, and across the street near Kearny and Dupoint. Some detachments marched round and invested the back of the building, and all places of approach were taken possession of and closely guarded. A brass six-pounder was then drawn up in front of the prison and directed point blank towards the heavy iron doors of the main entrance. All preparations were thus made to ensure complete success, at whatever risk, and at about 1 o'clock a part of the Executive Committee applied and demanded admittance into the prison. The Sheriff was inside, and seeing the utter uselessness of offering any sort of resistance, he threw open the doors. They then demanded the custody of Casey, handcuffed. This demand being communicated to the prisoner by the Sheriff, Casey drew a concealed knife and swore he would sooner kill himself at once than comply with the requisition; but upon being assured that he should not be injured in the least until he had had a fair and impartial trial, he consented to be handcuffed and was brought out of the Jail and placed in a carriage which was waiting at the door. As he came out of the prison, a loud shout arose from the multitudes around about which was at once stifled and suppressed. The armed bodies then fell into position, a portion of them before, a portion behind the carriage, in which was seated two of the Committee, with the prisoner, also Marshal North, at the request of Casey. </p><p>The procession, or rather army, took up its line of march down Kearny street, through Pacific, Montgomery, and down Sacramento street, to the Committee rooms, on the north side of Sacramento, between Front and Davis streets, where the carriage stopped and the prisoner was taken at once into the house. Charles Cora, the murderer of Richardson, meanwhile remained in the prison, which was still strictly guarded by a strong detachment of the Vigilance Committee, until about 4 o’clock, when the army of vigilance returned and took him down to the Committee-rooms as they had done Casey. The two prisoners then being supplied with bedding and other conveniences, a strong guard was placed over them, and everything having been done which the Executive Committee proposed to do for the present, most of the armed force deposited their arms and quietly retired to their homes. </p><p>Throughout the proceedings of the day no riot, drunkeness, or confusion was observable. The friends of Casey, and those who were expected to defend him, were nowhere to be seen. The different detachments were well drilled, and moved with the precision of veteran troops. No martial music preceded them and naught was heard but the heavy tramp of the armed thousands and the rushing of the crowds. The wise and temperate plans of the Executive Committee were carried out to the letter, and not a mistake was made. </p><p>Up to the present writing (Monday evening) the Committee have been, and still are, in session, trying the prisoners. A large crowd is constantly in the street near the Committee-rooms, but no sign of riot or excitement is visible. Detachments of men with muskets and fixed bayonets constantly patrol the roof of the building and the side walk in front, and bristling bayonets are seen on the stairway and at the upper windows. The prisoners will have a fair trial, and time given them, but it is pretty certain that the ends of Justice will be answered, and they will be hung. Whatever may be the result of the trial, the people all have the most perfect confidence in their Committee of Vigilance. This is rather hard on Cora, for he thought he was pretty certain to escape any very serious punishment for his fearful crime, and he and his friends have spared no expense in hiring lawyers, counsel and witnesses. His trial has been put off and evaded from time to time, and now he makes no scruple of saying that he should have got along well enough if it had not been for this affair of Casey's. </p><p>In many of the churches of yesterday, sermons were preached from the pulpit in relation to the proceedings of the last few days, and the action of the Vigilance Committee much approved of. </p><p>Mr. King is yet in a critical state, as his wound has commenced to suppurate, and he suffers much pain. If ever a community prayed for the recovery of anyone man, the prayers of the people of California are for the recovery of James King of William. </p><p>All the daily papers are of course filled with the incidents and topics of these exciting times, and the <em>Alta California, Evening Bulletin, </em>and some others contain somewhat inflammatory paragraphs and correspondence on this subject. James King of William is a man widely and favor ably known throughout the state, and the many meetings of the people in the interior cities and towns are all sympathizing with him, and breathing vengeance on the assassin Casey, are a sufficient evidence of his popularity. He is one of the early pioneers of this young state and if he dies - which God forbid - will leave a fond wife, and six children here in San Francisco. </p><p>The causes of this murderous attack were some editorial articles in the Bulletin, far from complimentary to the character of Casey, showing him up to the public as he really is, a convicted felon and notorious rowdy and scoundrel. It was all true, and Casey or any of his friends do not deny it, but it was for this fearless exposure of the villain that he was shot. </p><p>Casey was convicted Sept. 5, 1849, in New York, for grand larceny, and sentenced to Sing Sing for two years, which term he served and was discharged from prison on the 4th of Sept. 1851, since which period he has come to California where, being but little known and naturally smart, he contrived by wire pulling and ballot-box stuffing, with the aid of his friends among the gamblers and shoulder-strikers, to get into office, as did also many others of his stripe who now are in office here. Casey was a public officer, knew he was guilty of all and more than he was charged with, and as the only means of escaping further exposure and silencing the pen of the honest and independent writer, he coolly and deliberately plans and attempts to execute his victim. </p><p>All are now looking up to the Vigilance Committee in this matter, with the perfect confidence which was reposed in them in times past. This confidence will not be misplaced. They are at work calmly and deliberately, and when they do act they will act with the same coolness and deliberation which has characterized their proceedings up to the present time. They will make no mistakes. They will act, and act in a manner that will rid this city of the gang of murderers, rowdies and ballot-box stuffers who through past years have ruled it. </p><p>The past condition of things must no longer exist. It has become a cruel mockery to the people of California, and especially of San Francisco, about the law &quot;taking its course.&quot; For years past it has been permitted to take that &quot;course,&quot; and the result has been that murder after murder is being committed here in the open street, under the broad light of Heaven, and their farcical &quot;trials&quot; have only amounted to perfect immunity to the monied assassin, and the &quot;law&quot; protects the criminal not the public. These are stubborn facts, and cannot be denied with truth. </p><p>Since the failure to convict either Backus or the notorious Cora, what well disposed citizen has any confidence in the <em>justice </em>of San Francisco <em>law. </em>And is it strange that the Vigilance Committee are looked up to with such complete confidence at this present emergency? </p><p>In view of the law being so defective and powerless here in comparatively civilized San Francisco, let no one wonder that Judge Lynch is popular in the mining localities, and has ever been in years past, and will be in years to come. Every right thinking man must deprecate the sad necessity, which does now certainly exist here for the people to take into their own hands the administration of Justice. Give us law and order, by all means, but let it be of that kind which protects the public not the criminal. </p><p>Yours, BEN BOLT. </p><p>POSTSCRIPT. <br />Wednesday morning, May 21<sup>st</sup>.<br /><br />The mail which was to have left for the Atlantic, yesterday, being detained until to-day, I would add by way of postscript that James King of William died yesterday at half past one o'clock, P.M. </p><p>Yesterday morning it was spread abroad that Mr. King was much worse, and the attending physicians despaired of his life, and immediately upon the announcement of his death being made public, the stores closed, the bells all commenced tolling, crape and mourning were hung about in all the central part of the city, and the shipping in the harbor were displayed at half mast. The news of his death came rather suddenly upon the community, as he was supposed to be getting along very favorably under the circumstances. His widow and young family will be bountifully provided for by the overflowing public sympathy and benevolence. </p><p>Mr. King is to be buried tomorrow from the Unitarian church on Stockton street. He was 34 years of age when he died. All the musical societies and musicians of the city are to attend the funeral, together with the Masons and other societies, and it be probably be the greatest demonstration of the kind, ever before known in this country. Books are to be opened throughout the state for subscription for the benefit of his widow and orphans, and for a grand monument to his memory. </p><p>He was a man, not easily replaced in this community, and the public mourn, deeply mourn his loss. </p><p>The Vigilance Committee are still in session trying the prisoners. Casey is reported to have implicated several men of this city, of respectability and influence, as having had considerable to do with this cowardly assassination, and if this is found true, Heaven help them, for they will be in the hands of Judges and be tried by a Jury whom gold cannot corrupt. Whether the prisoners are to be hung or not, or what are to be the closing scenes of this grand drama, is only known to the Vigilance Committee, who silently, quietly but surely proceed in their great work of public regeneration. </p><p>One thing is certain: the Committee have given notice to a large number of suspicious persons and notorious scoundrels to leave on the steamer of to-day, and those unable to pay their own passages will have it paid for them. The city is quiet. Crowds are to be seen in the street, and strangers are here from all parts of country, but no signs of riot or excitement are visible. </p><p>It is the stillness as of the summer air at the near approach of a great thunder storm. </p><p>B.

Rock26,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXVI.<br />San Francisco, June 4<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: </p><p>The 22d of May 1856 - the day after the date of my last letter, will be forever set apart and remembered through future ages by the residents of this State, and of San Francisco particularly, as a day ripe with impressive scenes, of sad and thrilling interest. On that day this great city - the &quot;Queen of the Pacific,&quot; was in mourning for the loss of one of her worthiest and best beloved sons. The houses were all draped in mourning, the flags were displayed at half mast, while the solemn tones of the tolling bells pealed forth the funeral knell of James King, of William, he whose many social virtues had endeared him to the hearts of the people. Mournfully and silently the long pageant wound through the crowded streets as they followed him to his last resting place, and even as they passed, the body of his murderer - Casey - hung suspended from the gallows, side by side with Charles Cora, executed by the hands of a justly indignant populace. Three thousand of the Vigilance Committee were in the streets and on the roofs of the buildings near the Committee rooms, with gleaming muskets and bristling bayonets. In the midst of all this, the steamer Golden Age arrived from Panama, bringing the news of the late horrible railroad accident on the Isthmus. What must those passengers, just arriving here, have thought of the land of promise to which they had come. It was certainly rather of a hard introduction to California. </p><p>After services at the Unitarian church on Stockton street, the coffin was brought out by the Masons, of which Order the deceased was a member, and placed in the hearse. The procession then formed, passed down Washington St., to Montgomery, along Montgomery to Bush street, and up and out on Bush street to Lone Mountain Cemetery. The procession was about two miles in length, the longest ever before known in San Francisco. </p><p>First in order came the different Lodges of the Masonic Fraternity. They were dressed in black, with the usual aprons and regalia, with crape on their arms and badges on their breasts. Next came carriages bearing the officiating Ministers and others, and then the hearse, decorated with black and white plumes, and drawn by four splendid white horses in black nettings and plumes on their heads. The coffin was a plain one and it was covered with wreaths of flowers. Five pall bearers walked on each side. Next came a line of carriages containing the bereaved family of the deceased, and the nearest relations and friends. After the carriages came those connected with the editorial publication office and composing rooms of the <em>Evening Bulletin, </em>on foot, after which came the California Pioneers with badges on their breasts and crape on their arms. These were followed by a brass band from Sacramento, who bore their instruments in silence. The family of the deceased had expressed a wish that all display and ostentation should be avoided as much as possible, therefore the procession passed along in silence and the large number of musicians who were in the procession bore their instruments shrouded in crape. Next came the Pioneer Association from Sacramento, followed by the Sacramento Guards in full uniform preceded by mute drum and fife. The numerous fire companies of the city came next with their splendid banners and badges, after which followed a large body of the Musicians of the city. Then came the St. Mary's Library Association, followed by forty-two carriages containing citizens and their families. A cavalcade of five hundred horsemen came next. These were the teamsters and watermen of the city, and being nearly all large strong men, they formed quite an imposing feature in the procession. Next came the Riggers and Stevedores, the San Francisco Turn Verein, the San Francisco Harmony Association and several other civil societies and associations on foot, and the procession closed with forty carriages of citizens. At the Cemetery the coffin was placed in the receiving vault, after which the impressive and sublime burial service of the Masonic Brotherhood was read by A. G. Abell, R. W. Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of California. The Masonic prayer was offered by the Rev. Mr. Lacy and the farewell pronounced by the Grand Secretary. A benediction was then uttered by Rev. Mr. Lacy and the procession returned to the city. </p><p>The two prisoners, Casey and Cora, had been tried before the Vigilance Committee, and sentenced to be hung on that day, and preparations were accordingly made during the forenoon. Beams were run over two of the second story windows of the Committee rooms and beneath them were platforms, about three feet square, extending out from the window sills, and turning on hinges like table leaves, the outer ends being supported by ropes leading up to the beams. The prisoners had been brought up in the Catholic faith, and accordingly the Rev. Father Gallagher and Bishop Allemany were with them during the previous night and in their last moments. Ten thousand people crowded the streets and occupied the windows and roofs of the adjacent houses from where a view could be had of the execution, but the streets for a hundred feet or more around in the immediate vicinity were occupied by the Vigilance Committee, who kept the immense crowds of the people back and preserved entire order. </p><p>At quarter past one the prisoners were brought out on the platforms. Their arms and legs were pinioned and both wore white caps intended to be drawn over their eyes before the drop fell. When they appeared the entire multitude of the people stood uncovered. Cora bore himself erect and unmoved, but Casey, with a haggard and agitated look, after a short pause, thus addressed the assembled multitude, commencing in a loud and clear voice, as follows: - </p><p>&quot;Gentlemen, Fellow Citizens - I am not guilty of any crime. When I am dead, when I am laid in my grave, let no one dare traduce my character or asperse my memory. Let no man exult over me or point to my grave as that of an assassin. I am guilty of no crime. I only acted as I was taught - According to my early education - to avenge an insult. Let not the <em>Alta, </em>the <em>Chronicle </em>and the <em>Globe </em>persecute my memory; let them no more proclaim me a murderer to the world. Let them not insult me after death. I have an aged mother in the Atlantic States and I hope she may never hear how I died. I trust she will never know that I am executed on a charge of murder. I am not guilty of any such crime.&quot; </p><p>Here, Father Gallagher touched Casey and said, &quot;Pray to God to pardon you for your crime; pray God to save your soul.&quot; </p><p>Casey after hesitating a moment spoke again: </p><p>&quot;Oh! God, pardon and forgive me. Oh my mother! I hope she will never hear of this. Oh, God! have mercy on my mother; comfort her in her affliction. Oh! God! have mercy on my soul! Oh my God! my God! I am not guilty of murder - I did not intend to commit murder.&quot; </p><p>Here his voice rather failed him, and indistinctly speaking of his mother, he drew back. As he did so, the fatal noose was adjusted and the caps were drawn over the faces of the prisoners. At this Casey weakened in the knees, so that he had to be held up until, at given signal, the platforms fell, and in an instant, the bodies falling a distance of about five feet, the souls of James P. Casey and Charles Cora, were launched into eternity. </p><p>After remaining suspended fifty minutes - during which time not a shout was heard or the least confusion manifested among the thousands who were assembled - the bodies were let down, and given in charge of the City Coroner, who took them to his office. The body of Casey was afterwards delivered into the hands of Engine Company No. 10, of which he was once the foreman, and they buried him. The body of Cora was given to Belle Cora, his former mistress, but now his widow, as he had married her about an hour previous to his execution, and by her he was buried. Thus ended the first act of the Grand Drama. </p><p>On the following day - Friday - the long suspended business of the city was resumed; the stores were re-opened and all classes applied themselves to their usual avocations. The Vigilance Committee still continued their sessions, and have done so up to the present time, retaining from two to three hundred of their number about their rooms, on guard, except on two or three occasions when more were called out. From time to time they have arrested and confined to their Rooms one suspicious and notorious character after another, who have been implicated in sundry nefarious transactions in the way of election frauds and ballot-box stuffing, as well as other crimes. Those arrested by the Committee thus far, are Billy Mulligan, Martin Gallagher, James Carr, Yankee Sullivan, Woolly Kearney, Edward Bulger, and lastly, Charles P. Duane, the former Chief Engineer of the Fire Department here. </p><p>Considerable excitement was created again, throughout the city on Saturday, the last day of May, by the announcement that Yankee Sullivan had committed suicide in his cell at the Committee Rooms, where he was confined. Rumor was busy with her thousand tongues, and the friends of Sullivan and enemies of the Vigilance Committee seemed to be impressed with the idea that the Committee had murdered him. The Executive Committee, however, at once caused to be published an account of his death and all the circumstances relating to it. </p><p>It seems that at 5 1-2 o'clock in the morning he called to the guard who stood just outside the door of his cell and asked for a glass of water, which was brought to him. He said he had had a most horrible dream and proceeded to relate it. He dreamed that he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be hung. Then he heard the tramp of the soldiers leading him out to execution, then he felt the rope about his neck, and the next instant the fatal drop fell, and while hanging, he woke up, and called for a glass of water. </p><p>The guard laughed at him and assured him he need fear no such result, as the Committee were only going to send him away out of the country. Notwithstanding the guard tried to re-assure him and cheer him up as much as possible, he seemed to be very much depressed in his mind. He was left to himself again, and at 8 1-2 o'clock, when his breakfast was brought to him, he was found dead and cold. </p><p>Physicians were summoned at once, but they found that the spark of life had fled and were of opinion that he had been dead for some time. He was lying upon his bed and the knife with which he had committed the deed was lying by his side. It was a common case-knife which he had used in eating his food. It was very dull, but with it he had managed to cut into the fleshy part of his left arm, just above the elbow, laying open a horrid wound and completely severing two large arteries, which doubtless produced speedy death. </p><p>He had been tried by the Vigilance Committee and sentenced to be sent out of the country, but nevertheless he seemed to think they would hang him yet. He had made a full and unreserved confession of his numerous crimes and rowdyisms, and his confession is published in the papers, but the names of those implicated by it are suppressed for reasons best known to the Vigilance Committee. He was very penitent and expressed a determination to reform, if liberated, give up fighting and drink no more liquor. He begged them not to send him to Sydney, as he was once a convict there and had escaped. He seemed destitute of all moral courage whatever. He appeared completely cowed down and conscious-stricken and probably, if he had lived, he would have reformed and become a better man. </p><p>His real name was Francis Murray. He was born in Ireland, was thirty seven years of age, and leaves a wife and child in the city. The Coroner took charge of the body and afterwards delivered it to Mrs. Sullivan. While at the Coroner's office, upwards of ten thousand persons visited the body, to get a sight at the remains of this widely known individual. </p><p>On Friday last, at 1 o'clock P.M., Nicholas Graham was hung, in the yard of the County Jail, by the Sheriff for the murder of Joseph Brooks on the 18th of January last. He was a native of Ireland and about 27 years of age. </p><p>On the gallows he made a speech, which was published in the daily papers, and though short, it was the best and most impressive lecture on Temperance I ever knew of. He said his sentence was just and that he was contented to die. He said he was drunk at the time he committed the deed, and that it was entirely through the use of strong drink that he had at length come to the gallows. He most earnestly warned all who valued life and happiness in this world to abstain from the intoxicating cup. He mounted the scaffold with a firm step and seemed supported in his last moments by the consolations of religion, and the gallows appeared but a step into a brighter and happier world. His last words were, &quot;I die a true Catholic.&quot; </p><p>At the inquest of the body of James King, of William, evidence was adduced implicating Edward McGowan and Peter Wightman, as well as Casey, in the assassination, and the Grand Jury accordingly indicted all three, but notwithstanding the strict search which has been made for them, both McGowan and Wightman made good their escape and are now fugitives from that justice which would be surely meted out to them if taken. </p><p>Casey and Cora being Catholics, and as Casey and Sullivan were Irish, as well as most of those who are now in the hands of the Committee, the ignorant lower classes of the Irish in this city are very jealous of the acts of the Committee and easily excited on the subject. Many of those holding office in the city were elected by fraud and by the ballot box operations of Casey and his accomplices. Therefore feeling rather insecure in their present positions they are endeavoring to get up a movement in opposition to the Vigilance Committee by exciting the Irish and the friends of those with whom the Committee have dealt so summarily. </p><p>They called a mass meeting on the Plaza a day or two ago, but although there were a great many people gathered together there, such a row and fuss was raised that nobody could be much listened to and the meeting fairly &quot;fizzled out,&quot; and amounted to just nothing at all. </p><p>The Committee have made additional preparations at their headquarters, in case of emergency. They have now thirteen cannon mounted and ready. The tocsin, to be sounded in cases of emergency, is a large triangle, weighing one hundred pounds, placed upon the roof of the building, and ten thousand men are ready to shoulder their muskets at the first sound of the alarm. </p><p>Governor Johnson, during the trying scenes of the past fortnight, has been extremely busy at Sacramento, and could not find time to attend to things in this locality, but now finding he must &quot;keep it before the people&quot; that he is the duly elected Governor of this state, he yesterday issued a proclamation to the citizens of this County containing many &quot;whereas-es&quot; and declaring the &quot;aforesaid county of San Francisco, to be in a state of insurrection,&quot; proclaiming martial law, and ordering and directing all of the Volunteer Militia of the county, also all persons between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, subject to military duty within the county, to report themselves for duty immediately to Major General William T. Sherman, and to do military duty and serve as long as General Sherman wants them. He also orders the Vigilance Committee to disband their forces immediately and disperse. General Sherman also, having received his general orders from the Governor, has a word to say to the people. He says he has nothing to do with what has been done within the past two or three weeks, but must in future do what his duty plainly points out to him; so taking all things into consideration there would seem to be a very fair prospect of a civil war here soon. However, we can tell rather better about it by the end of the next fortnight. Until then, </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.  </p>",public://rock/Rock26.jpg
Rock27,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXVII.<br />San Francisco, June 19<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:</p><p>The Proclamation of the Governor and the general orders of Major Gen. Sherman, which had just been issued at the date of my last letter, had a somewhat exciting effect for about a week. Books were opened at the various recruiting offices, and several patriotically disposed individuals rallied to join the armies of the Governor and to show themselves ready to be drilled and fight under the standard of &quot;Law and Order;&quot; but it is notoriously a fact that those who thus gallantly came forward were mostly rowdies, gamblers, shoulder-strikers, &amp;c; there were very few honest men among them. Several of the public officers whose duty called upon them to comply with the Proclamation resigned their offices. The Wallace Guards, National Guard, and others of the city military who were called upon disbanded at once rather than turn their arms against their fellow citizens who were engaged in a just cause. They afterwards re-organized as independent companies, and are on the side of the people. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Vigilance Committee felt called upon to take measures in opposition to the Governor, and therefore signified their willingness to receive accessions to their numbers; accordingly hundreds rushed to join their ranks. I do not know their exact number at present, but they number many thousands. No gambler, rowdy, shoulder-striker, or any but what are known to be good well-disposed citizens, in good standing in society, are allowed to be sworn in. Having unlimited funds at their disposal, they have thousands of stands of arms of all descriptions at their headquarters, and the buildings which they now occupy are regularly fortified with cannon mounted on the roofs and at the windows commanding every avenue of approach. All along the front, on Sacramento street, they have thrown up a heavy barricade or breast-work of bags of sand, and through an embrasure a big thirty-two pounder is pointing up Sacramento street. </p><p>The &quot;Law and Order&quot; army of the Governor will go into camp at the Potrero, about three miles from this city, to-morrow - so say the newspapers - in readiness, at the call of the Governor, to &quot;go in&quot; and whip the Vigilance Committee. Their entire effective force numbers about five hundred men, and from the fewness of the numbers, as compared with those of the Committee, one would naturally suppose that their side of the grand issue is rather unpopular. </p><p>Major Gen. Sherman, after seeing the effect which his general orders had upon the minds of the people, on the 8th inst. sent in his resignation to the Governor rather than remain in the false position in which he was placed in relation to his fellow citizens. The City Marshal, Hampton North, has also resigned his office. </p><p>On the 5th of this month, Duane, Mulligan, and the other ballot-box stuffers and villains that the Committee had in their hands, were placed on ship-board and transported to some more genial clime; the pleasures of their presence, and their public services being no longer required in this ungrateful locality. A part of them were said to have been sent to Australia, part to Callao, a portion of them to the Sandwich Islands, and some on the steamer <em>Golden Age </em>for New York; but the thing was managed so quietly that few, if any, besides the Vigilance Committee know for certain where they were sent. Since then the Committee have arrested other notorious characters, who will also be sent off. Several others have had &quot;orders to leave&quot; by to-morrow. The following is a copy of one of these &quot;orders:&quot; </p><p>Executive Committee Chambers, <br />San Francisco, June 6th, 1856.<br /><br />William Hamilton - Sir: - The Committee of Vigilance, after a full investigation and deliberation, declare you guilty of being a notoriously bad character, and dangerous person, a disturber of the peace, a violator of the integrity of the ballot-box; and have accordingly adjudged the following sentence: </p><p>That you, William Hamilton, leave the State of California on or before the 20th day of June, 1856, never more to return, under the severest penalties. </p><p>In witness whereof, the Seal of the Committee of Vigilance is hereunto attached. By order of the Committee. </p><p>[Seal] 33, Secretary. </p><p>Among the recent arrests by the Committee is that of Thomas B. Cunningham, an undertaker in this city. He is said to have been the inventor and manufacturer of the celebrated &quot;patent ballot-box,&quot; now on exhibition in the rooms of the Committee. This renowned box was captured by the Committee two or three weeks ago. It has been in use at the various city elections for the last two or three years and no one not in the secret would see anything unusual about it; but although a very common, unpretending looking box, it has a false side and bottom, worked with slides and springs, by means of which it can be duly &quot;charged&quot; with illegal votes before the election; or after the polls are closed and the box sealed up, all the honest votes can be removed, and others substituted without breaking the seal. </p><p>Thus have our elections been controlled and turned into a complete farce, and our city offices bartered and sold by Casey, Duane, Sullivan and such like scoundrels, to those rascals paying the best for them. The confession of Yankee Sullivan tells admirably how the thing was done. These are the arrangements with which the Committee are now interfering, and with the participants in these nefarious transactions are they dealing not half so bad as they deserve. It is a very mild punishment to send them out of the country. </p><p>By such ingenious arrangements as these was the late election in the new county of San Mateo, near here, conducted, and the droll anomaly presented of about ten times as many votes polled as there were voters in the County. But the people arose in their might and kicked out all these self-elected scamps and setting the election entirely aside, called another election, which was conducted on more honest and satisfactory principles. </p><p>On the afternoon of the 14th inst, a tremendous mass meeting of the people was held in this city in the open space front of the Oriental Hotel. The number present was estimated at from 10 to 12,000, and they were addressed by Hons. Bailie Peyton, Wm. Duer, Judge G. W. Barker and others. The &quot;stars and stripes&quot; waved over the immense assemblage, and it was altogether an exciting scene - such as is not often beheld in any country. A series of resolutions, fully endorsing the entire action of the Vigilance Committee and assuring them of future support, were unanimously adopted; with loud and prolonged cheers the meeting adjourned, and thus ended this most enthusiastic demonstration. </p><p>[Our correspondent's letter closes with a synopsis of the Constitution under which the Committee act, which we are obliged to omit for want of space. The Governor has agreed not make any decisive move until the Committee has finished the work so well begun, and all fears of civil war are dissipated.] </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock27.jpg
Rock28,"<p>No. XXVIII.<br />From our California Correspondent.<br />San Francisco, July 5<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:</p><p>Saturday, the 21st of last month, was another of those days of deep and terrible popular excitement which have been so characteristic of San Francisco in the last few weeks. </p><p>About half past three o'clock in the afternoon of that day, Officer L. A. Hopkins, with a small posse of the vigilance police, by order of the committee attempted to arrest a Mr. J. R. Maloney, on Jackson street near Kearney. Judge Terry of the supreme court and four others were with Maloney, and attempted by force of arms to prevent the arrest. An affray was the result, in which the Judge stabbed Hopkins in the neck with a Bowie knife, inflicting a very dangerous wound. This ended the fight, and Maloney and his party took refuge in the armory of the San Francisco Blues, which was near by. </p><p>The news of the affray spread with the speed of lightning, and in a few moments the big bell of the vigilance committee sounded forth the alarm. Then commenced a scene which defies description. Men rushed through the streets from all quarters. Merchants closed their stores, mechanics threw aside their tools, and all rushed in a vast human tide to the fortified headquarters of the vigilance committee, now called &quot;Fort Vigilance,&quot; on Sacramento street. </p><p>In less time than it takes to write this, a thousand of the committee were under arms and marching to the scene of action. Arrived at the armory, they proceeded at once to surround it, and on the arrival of a portion of the executive committee, a surrender of all those in the building was demanded, together with the arms, ammunition, &amp;c., within fifteen minutes, with the promise of the committee that the prisoners as well as the building should be protected from parties outside the vigilance organization. The demand was complied with, carriages were procured, and Judge Terry, Maloney, and all the occupants, sixteen in number, were escorted down to Fort Vigilance under a very strong guard. A hundred stand of arms, together with the accoutrements, were taken from the armory and taken to the fort. </p><p>During these operations, a large force of the committees had invested the California Exchange, at the foot of the Plaza, the main head-quarters of the so-called &quot;law and order&quot; party. Two heavy field-pieces, loaded, were planted in the street in front of the building, and those within commanded to surrender. There were about 70 of Gov. Johnson's &quot;troops&quot; in the building at the time. Considerable negotiations were formally entered into and resulted in the surrender of all hands, together with three hundred stand of arms, ammunition, &amp;c., which was at once placed on drays and conveyed, together with all the prisoners, under a guard of 800 men, to the vigilance head-quarters. The other &quot;law and order&quot; armories in the city were also taken possession of and the arms &amp;c. removed to the fort. </p><p>Thus happily ended the decisive proceedings of the committee of the people and the total annihilation of the miscalled &quot;law and order&quot; party was accomplished for the present at least. Most of the prisoners were discharged after a few hours' confinement, they being probably deemed more troublesome than dangerous; their leaders, however, were released on parole of honor. At sunset everything was as quiet as though nothing extraordinary had taken place. </p><p>The entire proceedings of the committee in this grand <em>coup de etat </em>were conducted throughout in that orderly and systematic manner which has characterized their action from the first; and as the different armed detachments deployed through the streets, the whole people seemed to realize that they were under the protection of those in whom they could implicitly trust. It was a signal rebuke to him whom the people had chosen to rule over them as governor of the state, for daring to collect arms in their midst to shoot down the people. And Judge Terry, too, a judge of the supreme court, in a street fight! Why was he not at Sacramento where he belonged, by the side of Gov. Johnson? for he was the governor's principal adviser when he issued that most ill-timed and ill-advised proclamation, which he would gladly withdraw even now, if he could do so without disgrace. </p><p>During the height of the excitement the popular voice was for the hanging of Judge Terry at once and had Hopkins died, it is to be feared that violent measures would indeed have been resorted to. Hopkins was stabbed in the back of the neck, and the wound is nearly six inches deep and an inch and a quarter long. It is a fearful wound and he has been fluctuating between life and death, but the crisis is now nearly past and strong hopes are entertained of his ultimate recovery. Judge Terry is still in the hands of the vigilance committee, and will be dealt with as they may see fit. Even if Hopkins dies, they will hardly hang him, as there are some circumstances to be considered in mitigation of the crime, and notwithstanding people may demand life for life, and cry &quot;hang him!&quot; wise and cool heads rule their councils, and naught but justice will be meted out to the guilty; and with their decision, as heretofore, the whole people will be satisfied. </p><p>The governor can do nothing at present, having neither troops to fight nor arms to fight with. For this condition of things he may thank his own foolish course; for had he not taken the stand he has, the committee would not have been obliged to fortify their position and act on the defensive, but long ere this would have finished their mission and, resigning their power into the hands of the people from whom it was received, retired from the scene. </p><p>Again has the &quot;ever glorious fourth&quot; come and passed away. It was celebrated here as usual, by a procession, great display of flags, the booming of big guns, the banging of innumerable small guns, and the cracking, popping and fizzing of pistols, crackers and squibs. </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock28.jpg
Rock29,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXIX.<br />San Francisco, July 20<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:</p><p>Nothing of a very stirring nature, as compared with previous events, has occurred during the past fortnight to disturb the equanimity of this city's population, although the governor still proclaims us to be &quot;in a state of insurrection.&quot; The Vigilance Committee continue the session at their Rooms, and make almost daily arrests of notorious and suspicious individuals. Some of these, after trial, are discharged again, while others are kept on hand for the next &quot;shipment&quot; from the State. A few days ago they arrested the notorious &quot;Chris Lilly,&quot; who, it will be remembered, killed McCoy in a prize fight a few years ago. He has to &quot;leave the State by to-morrow's steamer.&quot; He made no objection to this arrangement, merely asking and receiving permission and time to settle up his affairs here previous to leaving. </p><p>Judge Terry is still in the hands of the Committee and they appear to be awaiting the result of Hopkins' wound before they can decide his case. The situation of Hopkins is yet critical, and fears are still entertained by his physicians that his wound may prove fatal as within a few days he has been attacked with erysipelas which has extended itself over his neck and head. It will be some time yet before he is entirely out of danger. </p><p>On the evening of Saturday, the 12th inst., another grand mass meeting of the citizens was held in front of Montgomery block. The meeting was addressed by several prominent citizens and a petition and series of resolutions adopted, calling upon the various officers of the city and county to resign their offices, as by reason of the gross frauds which were perpetrated at the last election, through the means of ballot-box stuffing, illegal voting, false counting, filing illegal returns &amp;c., it .is now uncertain as to whether they were really elected or not. A committee of thirty-three persons were appointed to wait upon them, express to them the feelings and desires of the meeting, and request them to resign their several offices, that another and more satisfactory election may be held or the governor appoint others to fill their places who would be more acceptable, in the opinion of the people, than are some of the present incumbents. The meeting was adjourned till Monday evening, the 14th inst., when a large and enthusiastic assemblage again met, to hear the report of the committee. </p><p>The Committee reported having presented notes to each of the officers, requesting them to resign, and from each of them they received written replies refusing to comply with the request. Some of these replies were read to the meeting. Two or three of the officials expressed their willingness to resign, providing all the rest did the same. An office in this city is a pretty lucrative and easy berth, with fat salaries and a fine chance for &quot;stealings,&quot; therefore those holding them are averse to relinquishing such golden opportunities just merely because the &quot;people&quot; desire them to do so. </p><p>Several resolutions were adopted and speeches were made bearing upon the subject, and the meeting finally adjourned, subject to the call of the chairman. </p><p>A Committee of Investigation has lately been looking into the manner in which the business of the various city offices have been conducted, and their Report in the daily papers contains many astonishing revelations in the way of official corruption and embezzlement, calculated to open the eyes of the tax-payers, and shows pretty conclusively where all the money goes to. </p><p>Quite a sensation was created here on the 9th inst., by the arrival of the steamer <em>Sea Bird </em>from Santa Barbara, bringing the news that <em>Ned McGowan </em>was seen at that place on the 6th inst. He was soon recognized and an attempt made to arrest him, but he succeeded in escaping to the bushes and hills, followed by large bodies of the citizens. Up to the time of the sailing of the steamer (the 7th) he had not been captured. He was travelling on horseback down the coast towards San Diego, but becoming exhausted with his long journey, he had ventured into Santa Barbara. </p><p>A Mexican boy and an American who were with him were arrested by the Sheriff of Santa Barbara, and they stated under oath that McGowan had left San Francisco about the 23d or 25th of June, that they joined him at Santa Cruz, and that McGowan told them he was going to San Diego to buy cattle, and hired them to accompany him. </p><p>Immediately, on receipt of this intelligence, a detachment of the Vigilance Committee started in a fast-sailing schooner for Santa Barbara, but up to the present time nothing has been heard from them. McGowan, it will be recollected, was implicated with Casey in the assassination of James King of William, and the Vigilance Committee, desirous of laying hands on him, have searched high and low for him, but thus far unsuccessfully. It is to be hoped that the villain may yet be taken and have justice done him. </p><p>On the afternoon of the 18th inst., a splendid banner was presented to the Battalion Citizen's Guard, one of the companies of the Vigilance Committee, by the ladies of San Francisco. The presentation took place at Musical Hall on Bush street, in the presence of a crowded assemblage of spectators. Miss Louisa Dam, in behalf of those interested, came forward and did the honors of presentation, accompanied by the following appropriate address: </p><p>Gentlemen of the Battalion Citizen's Guard: - It is with deep emotion that I appear before you on this occasion, to present you with this Banner, as a token of the high regard in which you are held by the Ladies of San Francisco. - The work in which you are engaged is a noble one, and worthy the patriots of earlier days. - We all regret the necessity that existed in this city of calling into service this noble band. Virtue and innocence were obliged to hide themselves. The blood of the innocent has flown in our streets; justice and the rights so dear to every freeman have been trampled under foot, but the time of retribution has come. You have thus far done your duty nobly, and nothing but a true love to your country and the noble principles bequeathed us by our fathers, could have nerved you for this important crisis. Go on, gentlemen, and complete your work. May your vigilant eye, the insignia of your banner, be a terror to evil doers; and may you long live to enjoy the blessings of a pure government in this city and State, and you shall ever have the hearty co-operation of every true woman. </p><p>Lieutenant Col. Olney replied to this in a neat and suitable speech. The American Brass Band were in attendance and performed several soul-stirring airs suited to the occasion. A Quartette Club mounted the stage and sung the &quot;Star Spangled Banner,&quot; with appropriate verses, and a very interesting address was delivered by Capt. S. T. Thompson, a member of the Executive Committee, referring to the circumstances which produced and called forth the powerful Vigilance organization, and setting forth the beneficial and happy results which have thus far followed the action of the Committee. More music and singing closed the exercises of this interesting occasion. </p><p>The Banner is wrought of a beautiful article of blue satin, bordered with a heavy silk fringe. It is about eight feet square, and supported by the usual flagstaff. On one side is an excellently painted eye of Vigilance and this inscription: &quot;Battalion Citizens' Guard, organized May 18, 1856;&quot; also the motto of &quot;Nunquam Dormio.&quot; The other side bears the following inscription: &quot;Presented by the Ladies of San Francisco, to the Battalion Citizens' Guard, (V. C.,) July 18th, 1856.&quot; </p><p>Since the arrival of the mail steamer on the 14th inst., numerous and noisy &quot;ratification meetings&quot; have been held, big guns fired, fireworks exploded, and tar barrels burnt, the various political parties here heartily endorsing the Presidential nominations of the Conventions on your side of the Continent. Last evening the Republicans held a grand ratification meeting, and the thundering of two hundred guns, together with speeches and other &quot;doings,&quot; signalized their acceptance of Col. John C. Fremont for the Presidency. </p><p>The political party most desirous of securing the vote of the State should bear in mind that the immediate construction of the Pacific Railroad is <em>the </em>item of interest to all Californians. The Republican party has been very judicious in that respect, as well as in the nomination of Fremont for the Presidency. Mrs. Julia Dean Hayne is just completing a successful engagement at the Metropolitan theatre, and receives a complimentary benefit tomorrow (Monday) evening.</p><p>Considerable showers of rain fell in the mining region on the 4th, a remarkable occurrence never before known here, within the memory of the &quot;oldest inhabitant.&quot; </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock29.jpg
Rock30,"<p>No. XXX<br />San Francisco Aug 3<sup>rd</sup> 1856</p><p>Friend Rock,</p><p>And yet again has the pistol of the assassin done its murderous work, and once more has a bloody tragedy been publicly enacted in our very midst, and in the broad light of day. Again has justice through the instrumentality of the Committee of the People been meted out to the murderer, and two more blood thirsty assassins have gone to swell the list of the victims of the hangman. </p><p>About 4 o'clock PM of the 24<sup>th</sup> ult. at the bar room of the St Nicholas Hotel on Sansom street, as Dr. Andrew Randall, an esteemed fellow citizen was registering his name in the book for that purpose, a man by the name of Hethrington stepped up to him and jerked him violently round by the beard, saying: &quot;Damn you, I’ve got you now.” Randall drew a pistol, and they both fired at nearly the same moment. Several other shots were fired and Randall fell with his brains oozing from a bullet hole in his left temple. Hethrington was arrested at once, by some of the Vigilance Police and taken to the Committee Rooms. Dr. Randall lived till the morning of the 26th, but from the time of the shooting he remained partially paralysed, and perfectly insensible. He was about fifty years of age, of unblemished character, esteemed by all who knew him, and leaves a wife and two small children. </p><p>Hethrington was formerly from St. Louis Mo, and is the one who killed Dr. Baldwin in this city a few years ago. He shot him in the back as he was running from him but was acquitted through some of the Juggleries of the law, so often practiced in our courts, and turned loose, to seek another victim. He and Dr. Randall had previously had some difficulties together growing out of business transactions, and the Dr. had often expressed the fear that Hethrington would kill him, as he had repeatedly threatened to do so. The account of the tragedy, spread rapidly throughout the City, and considerable excitement was created, but as the assassin was in the hands of Vigilance, the people were satisfied.</p><p>About 6 o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th Joseph Hethrington and Philander Brace, were both hung by the Vigilance Committee. Brace was the murderer of Joseph West near the Mission Dolores about a year ago and has been in the hands of the Committee, under sentence for some time.</p><p>The gallows was erected in the centre of Davis street half way between Sacramento and Commercial streets. Between three and four thousand of the Committee were on duty under arms, and at the intersection of the streets loaded field pieces were planted with matches lighted and ready. Some papers estimated the crowd of spectators present at 15,000, but a correct estimate could not be arrived at. The roofs of three of the houses in the immediate vicinity were crushed in by the, weight of people on them, but luckily no one was much injured. Brace seemed determined to &quot;die game,&quot; and while, standing on the fatal drop, he cursed and blasphemed loudly. Hethrington seemed penitent, and made a speech, in which he endeavoured to justify the crimes he had committed. He was frequently interrupted by the loud and ribald language of Brace, who at length became so obscene and blasphemous that a handkerchief was tied over his mouth to keep him quiet. When they had been suspended thirty five minutes they were cut down, and conveyed in a cart, to the Committee Rooms.</p><p>At the latest accounts from the southern coast Ned McGowan had not been taken. “He will probably effect his escape. </p><p>Judge Terry is still in the hands of the Vigilance Committee, but Hopkins, the man he stabbed, has nearly recovered, and is pronounced out of danger by his physicians.</p><p>Edward t Bulger, who was sent to the Sandwich Islands on the 5th of June, by the Vigilance Committee, returned on the 24th ult. and was re-arrested by the Committee at once. He says he returned to request of the Committee to send him to New York which was granted and will have on the steamer of the 5th inst.

Aug. 17<sup>th</sup>, 1855.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: --</p><p>Like &quot;Poor Joe&quot; in Dickens' &quot;Bleak House,&quot; your old correspondent has again been &quot;moving on,&quot; and is at present domesticated and settled for a time upon the ranche of a friend at this point, in a rural district far removed from the dust, din, assassinations, executions, proclamations, and exciting scenes, alas! so incidental to San Francisco life during the past three or four months; and as in that stirring city, our correspondence partook of the topics and spirit of the times, so it now may perhaps assume, and partake of a more rural and peaceable character. </p><p>Mountain View is situated in the valley of Santa Clara, forty miles from San Francisco, in the midst of a fine agricultural district, and like many other &quot;towns&quot; in California, consists of a post-office, hotel, a grocery or so, a dwelling house, a Jew shop, &amp;c. It is very prettily located on the main road to San Jose, shaded by large, fine spreading oaks; and being somewhat of a central point for the surrounding district, will perhaps become at some future time, a town of the first importance. It obviously received its peculiar name from the fine view of the coast range of mountains presented at this particular point. I presume that the ranche from which I write, might be considered as rather in the &quot;suburbs,&quot; as it is two miles from the post-office. </p><p>Most of the ranches hereabouts produced rather short crops this year, owing to backwardness of the season and the lack of rain, and in many cases the crops would not pay to harvest. One friend of mine, who has just finished harvesting, tells me that every pound of wheat that he raised this season, cost him just <em>seven cents. </em>It only yielded about six bushels to the acre. </p><p>On this ranche a medium crop was raised, the grain yielding forty bushels to the acre; this is by reason of being better located on lower ground, and under the best of management. </p><p>The squirrels are the grand pest of this valley. They are almost as bad as the locusts of Egypt, or the grasshoppers of Utah, in their devastation on the vegetable and grain crops. They are a large variety of the gray ground squirrel; the whole valley is their burrow, and their name is indeed &quot;Legion,&quot; for they are plentier here, than are the rats in San Francisco. &quot;Squirrel proof&quot; fencing, and strychnine, are the most effectual weapons used against them. But of these troublesome little vermin I have already written in a former letter. </p><p>This ranche is supplied with water by a splendid Artesian well, probably the best one in the valley. It is one hundred and ninety-four feet in depth, five inches in diameter, and the cool pure water flows from it at the rate of nearly fifty gallons a minute, in a steady unvarying stream; furnishing an abundant supply for the house, barns, cattle, irrigation purposes, &amp;c. This is on a level plain six miles from any hills. It was completed two years ago, at the expense of about one thousand dollars, and up to the present time has supplied the same quantity of water, without the least diminution. There are several other wells of this description in the valley, but in many of them the water has failed partially or entirely. </p><p>How would one of these fine sparkling Artesian fountains look in Town Square, under the shady branches of those glorious old elms; or on the Green, dashing and playing among the green grass, as it sung and danced gaily onward, with unceasing flow, to mingle its limpid waters with the blue waters of the Pilgrim's harbor? </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock31.jpg
Rock32,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXII.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal. Sept 2d, 1855.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: --</p><p>Throughout the State, the tocsin is sounding, and all parties are marshaling their forces for the coming Presidential contest. Clubs are formed, and fast forming, conventions and caucuses are held, and great speakers have commenced stumping the state. The ball is opened and the campaign has begun in earnest. Fremont, Buchanan, and Fillmore are in the field as the only recognized candidates, and as a matter of course, their various merits, and demerits are freely discussed, and their characters torn to pieces and examined into, and all their acts and misdemeanors, from boyhood up, laid before the discriminating public. The forlorn old bachelor Buchanan will receive the sympathetic votes of a very large number of the bachelors, as well as the Benedicts of California, but to judge from the signs of the times, as well as what seems to be the popular feeling, Fremont will most surely carry this state, by a good majority. </p><p>Don't call me a Bolt-er, if I do differ from you politically, and &quot;go in&quot; for Fremont. - The fact of it is, that us Californians, comparatively isolated as we are from the rest of civilization, wish, and have for the last six years prayed for a railroad across the Continent, on our own territory; avoiding the long, perilous, and dreary passage around Cape Horn, as well as the fevers and <em>machetes </em>of the mongrel-Spanish assassins of the Isthmus route. Sojourners in a distant land, our hearts have yearned towards &quot;the loved ones at home,&quot; and we have longed for the Pacific Railroad, as the only sure, safe and speedy means of communication. </p><p>John C. Fremont has done more to develope the feasibility of the project than any other live white man, and we feel that in placing him in the Presidential chair, we secure the early completion of what we have so long needed, and most earnestly desired - the Pacific Railroad. </p><p>Our markets abound with fruit of all kinds. The finest of peaches, apples, pears, &amp;c., seem plenty; but good fruit bears a high price, and although throughout the country thrifty young orchards are fast coming forward, it will be some years yet before we can fairly compete with the older states in this respect. Strawberries this season sold at two dollars per pound at first, but as they became plentier in the market, the price declined gradually to twenty-five cents per pound. Watermelons are always very abundant in the season of them, and as cheap as could be wished. They are a crop that seem peculiarly adapted to this climate, and require no attention to produce a superabundance. </p><p>On the road from San Francisco four weeks ago in the ranch of a friend about nine miles from the city, I saw some most enormous vegetables, in the turnip line. They were the common flat English turnip, - not Ruta Baga. - The largest one measured fourteen inches in diameter, and weighed <em>seventeen pounds. </em>There were a hundred or more, that would weigh ten and twelve pounds each, and from one corner of the patch, within a space of about fifty feet in length, by twenty feet in width, <em>thirty-three hundred pounds </em>were taken. This was about a fair average of the whole patch. Such a yield is hard to beat. This was on a light, black, sandy soil, on a hill side, and it was never manured, and never irrigated, except by the heavy fogs coming in from the Pacific Ocean. </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p><p>--</p><p>CALIFORNIA. – It will be noticed that our California Correspondent is getting excited on the question of politics, and is deluded with the belief that Fremont is to get the electoral vote of that state. By his own statement, we do not see but that he is bound to vote for Buchanan, himself, being one of the bachelors yet, we believe, who he says are Mr. B’s only support; and as the number of bachelors in California far outnumber the married voters, we think our Bolter is “hoisted on his own petard.” He has our most unfeigned sympathy in the great disappointment that is in store for him; and has a tract from a letter received by the same mail, and dated Shasta, California, Sept. 1. 1856: --</p><p>“The presidential canvass is moving up here pretty rapidly. Buchanan will carry California by a plurality of about 10,000. Fillmore will lead Fremont handsomely, but he cannot shine with “old Buck.” Californians cannot be sold with Fremont; they know him a little too well. He represented us in the U.S. senate a little while, and did not do as well for us as a vacancy would.”</p>",public://rock/Rock32.jpg
Rock33,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXIII.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal. Sept 18, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: --</p><p>You will see in the California papers by this mail, the full particulars of the trial and acquittal of Durkee charged with piracy, in boarding a schooner in the bay, on the 22d of June last, by order of the Vigilance Committee, and taking by force from her, sundry cases of muskets and other arms belonging to government. </p><p>The far-famed Vigilance Committee, the terror of assassins and those whose ways are evil, although apparently disbanded, nevertheless still exist in full force and organization, and should any emergency again occur, calling for their decisive action and interference, they will be found ready and equal to the occasion. </p><p>In judging of their past acts, and the general unanimity with which they have been upheld by their fellow citizens and the people of this state, no doubt many of our friends in the Atlantic states will join in condemnation. But allowances must be made for our peculiar and comparatively unsettled state of society and institutions. Look at the causes which called forth and produced this vast combination and rising of the whole people in their might, to assert the majesty of the down-trodden and outraged laws. Too long had murderers, thieves, and shoulder-strikers, stalked boldly in our midst. Too long had our elections been controlled, and our city offices filled by rowdies, gamblers, and those whose only object was to rob the treasury and swindle the city out of all that was valuable belonging to her. Let no one say that our remedy for these evils, should have been at the polls, for the “patent ballot-box,&quot; captured by the Vigilance Committee, and which has been used at all the city elections, is still on exhibition, showing the foul and rascally means by which honest votes have been set aside, others substituted, an our offices filled with corrupt and dishonest men. The people are once again in power; the ends for which they have contended are now apparent to all, and to them they point in justification of the means used.</p><p>On the 10th inst., for a rarity, we were visited by several showers of rain, the first of the season. From this, the weatherwise ones, predict an early and wet winter. Every fall these wiseacres shake their heads, and speak of the &quot;signs&quot; and &quot;indications&quot; they see of a very &quot;wet winter;&quot; but nevertheless, &quot;the clerk of the weather,&quot; who is said to have the principal control in that respect, has generally evinced a total disregard of all their wise auguries, and since 1848, we have had but two decidedly &quot;wet winters;&quot; these were the winters of '49 and '52. </p><p>The climate of this great valley of Santa Clara, is the most even and temperate I have yet met with in California. During the dry season, the sky is clear for months together. It is warm, but not uncomfortably so, as a cool refreshing breeze, invariably comes in from the bay to temper the air. The winters too, are mild, an ice rarely forms of more than an inch in thickness. The air is always pure, bracing and healthy, and cases of sickness are most happily rare.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock33.jpg

Oct 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: -- </p><p>Among the many resources of this state, the raising of sheep and the exportation of wool promises ere long to become one of the main sources of wealth, and it may not be many years before wool is a principal staple of California trade. This state being admirably adapted to wool-growing, a fine article of wool is raised here, and speculators are engaged in buying it up for shipment to the New York market, where it will command a high price.</p><p>Hides and tallow, before the gold discovery, formed the principal, in fact almost the only articles of export, but this source of wealth was soon swallowed up and lost sight of, in the great rush for gold. No less cattle were slaughtered, but they were butchered for food, and the hides were used for tents, roofs, and such like purposes, or were left uncared for to rot on the ground. But now again, large quantities of hides are being exported, to be returned in time to us, in the shape of boots and shoes. Tanneries are in operation here at various points, but not extensively enough to prevent exportation of the green hides. Stock-raising is probably as profitable business as any in the country at the present time, as even raising the cattle for slaughtering alone, the beef commands from fifteen to thirty cents per pound, and the hides and tallow bring a good price. In San Francisco, &quot;Porter House steaks&quot; are thirty cents per pound, no matter what part of the animal they are taken from. &quot;What's in a name.&quot; </p><p>The Salmon fisheries throughout the state, during the past season, yielded larger returns than ever before. Besides what is used for home consumption, large quantities are salted down, or smoked for exportation, affording lucrative employment to a large number of persons. The Chinese in the interior have made it quite a branch of their business, capturing and curing Salmon for the large dealers. </p><p>The Salmon Trout of the mountain streams is a most beautiful and delicious fish, and not to be beaten for good eating by any other freshwater fish; at least I used to think so when I was a gold digger. They generally weigh from two to four pounds, and are abundant in most of the upper streams and river sources of the Sierra Nevada. In the fish-markets of San Francisco, are to be seen fish of all kinds, sizes, and shapes, from a big sturgeon, down to a shrimp. Clams and Oysters are there to be found, but not &quot;Norfolk&quot; oysters or good old down east clams, such as are to be found on Plymouth shores. The cod-fish, too, are different, both in color and shape, from those at home and are finer meated. </p><p>Now, the &quot;dry season&quot; is certainly with us; the harvest is past, and the whole surface of the earth is dry and parched. Large cracks appear in the rich soil, and the whole of California, by means of hot sun and dry winds, seems converted into one vast <em>&quot;adobe&quot; </em>or sun-dried brick. The grass of the pastures is dry, but still is good feed for cattle, until the first rains, when the new grass springs up fresh and green. Now is the season of fires. The wadding, discharged from a gun, lighting among the dry grass, or other trifling cause, may kindle a fire that will burn over thousands of acres, and destroy much valuable property, before it can be arrested; for the grass burns like tinder, and the fire runs before the wind like a race hound. Look in almost any direction in the night, and fires can be seen gleaming on the mountain ranges, or on the tule plains, kindled either by accident or design, - as often the one as the other. A fire has been burning in the coast range mountains, in sight, a few miles from here, for the last six weeks, and some haystacks, houses, fences, &amp;c., been destroyed. It is still burning high up in the mountains, and it presents a most beautiful appearance in the night time. But – </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock34.jpg
Rock35,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXV. <br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co., <br />Cal. Oct 18<sup>th</sup>, 1856.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: --</p><p>The great annual agricultural Fair and Exhibition, which was held at San Jose, closed on the 9th inst. It continued for the space of four days, and during that time San Jose was filled with visitors from all quarters of the State. The hotels and boarding houses were crammed to overflowing, and the landlords reaped a golden harvest for the time being, as they charged three dollars per night for lodging, and board ranged high in proportion. </p><p>The exhibition of fine stock, from all parts of the State, was highly creditable, and fully as good as could be expected; and the display of mammoth vegetables and fruit was such as is only to be seen in California. Fruit is not so plenty here, of course, as it is the older states, but what is raised here, is of fine quality, and generally attains a pretty good size. The largest apple on exhibition weighed four pounds, and the largest pear two pounds. </p><p>Riding on horseback is a characteristic item in California life, and is much in vogue among all classes of people. On the third day of the Fair, several ladies and gentlemen contended for premiums as equestrians. The highest premium for lady equestrianship, - a splendid saddle, worth seventy-five dollars, - was awarded to the Mayoress of San Jose; and the highest premium for the gentleman, twenty-five dollars, was taken by Patrick Murphy. With his horse dashing along at full speed, he could with ease stoop in the saddle, and pick up a rope, chip, piece of paper, and other small objects from the ground. This is considerable of a feat, and the horse must understand it as well as the rider. In lassoing wild cattle, the horseman may by accident or otherwise, lose his end of the lasso; and to recover this, while at full speed in chase of the bullock, by stooping in the saddle and picking it up as it trails in the dust, is considered a highly desirable accomplishment by a <em>vacquers </em>or cattle herder. </p><p>Last year, at the Fair at Sacramento, the highest premium for horsemanship was taken by Mr. Crosby, of this place. He could not only, while with <em>his </em>horse at full speed, pick up small objects from the ground, but could pick up a small boy by the shoulders and place him safely in the saddle in front of him, without checking the speed of his horse at all. </p><p>This reminds me of what I once saw in that line at a Mexican fandango, on the Calaveras. An old dung-hill rooster was procured, the feathers picked from his neck, and his head and neck were greased. He was then buried alive in the ground, with just his head and neck above the surface. Several Mexicans then endeavored with their horses at full speed, to pull this rooster from the ground, by stooping in the saddle, as they dashed past him, and the fortunate <em>hombre </em>was to receive not only the rooster, but a purse of twenty-five dollars, which was tied to one of his legs, and free liquor for the rest of the day. The poor fowl kept dodging his head from side to side, and got his greasy neck well stretched by the various unsuccessful attempts to win the prize. One dirty Mexican was twice thrown from his saddle, and the second time was so badly injured about the head, that he was obliged to leave the field to <em>his </em>competitors. At length after repeated failures, one of them succeeded in his attempt, and bore the prize into camp, amid the loud <em>bravos </em>of the numerous spectators, among whom were several dark-eyed <em>senoritas. </em>In less than two hours afterwards, I saw him lying on his back in the chapparal, snoring; excitement and whiskey having rendered him oblivious, alike of the cares of this lower world, and his newly won laurels. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock35.jpg
Rock36,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXVI.</p><p>Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,</p><p>Cal., Nov. 3d, 1856.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -</p><p>The equanimity of this golden State, is at present, principally disturbed only by the Presidential election, which serves happily to divert people's minds from the sad and thrilling scenes of the last few months. The newspapers no longer teem with flowing paragraphs, and startling news of the doings of the far-famed Vigilance Committee, but all are deeply interested in the present grand Presidential contest, and even the latest news from Kansas, which has occupied a prominent position in the public attention of late, has become of secondary importance. Barbecues, mass meetings, and &quot;speechifyings” are the order of the day, and among the various parties, the greatest enthusiasm prevails. </p><p>We have had several showers of rain lately, just enough to lay the dust for a few hours at a time; but it is rather too soon yet for the rainy season to commence. As soon as the ground is wet down deep enough by the first rains, the farmers all commence ploughing, and putting in their grain; so that by February, “seed time&quot; is about over. Deep ploughing is found by experience, to bring the best crops, even in the very dryest locations; not that the surface is not as rich as the sub-soil, but by ploughing deep, the moisture of the earth is retained for a longer time during the scorching heat of summer, and consequently, better crops are produced. The grain crop, this last season, was not quite as good as usual, therefore grain of all kinds commands a good price at present. Wheat brings two and a half cents per pound, and has an upward tendency. Potatoes too were not so plentiful as usual this season, and now bring a high price; quite a contrast to what it was two years ago, when they were so very abundant that the markets were glutted, and in many instances they laid and rotted in the pile, or in the ground, as it would not pay to carry them to market. Indeed, in this valley, they could not be given away, as everybody had plenty of them. They now sell readily at from two to three cents per pound, and the rice ranging upward at that.</p><p>Robberies throughout the mining region seem to have much increased of late, and several notorious scamps have been arrested, some of whom were found to be escaped convicts from the State prison. Teamsters, and travellers, have been stopped and robbed on the public highways, miners have been found murdered and robbed in their own camps, and in fact organized bands of robbers are found to be conducting their nefarious trade in spite of either Judge Lynch, or the civil law. Joaquin Murieta, the celebrated mountain bandit, who so flourished in Calaveras and the adjoining counties in 1851-2, and was at last hunted down and killed by Capt. Harry Love and his party of rangers, is reported to be again alive, and at the head of another brave gang of banditti. He is said to have paid a dollar <em>to go in and see his head, </em>which was on exhibition at Mokelumne Hill, preserved in spirits, in a glass case; and now has the infinite presumption to assert that he &quot;hasn't been dead at all,&quot; but has been on a visit to Mexico, from which he has just returned, to take up his old business again. </p><p>But notwithstanding all that is said to the contrary, Joaquin Murieta is most probably dead. I was in Calaveras county at the time of his bloody exploits, and when he was at last killed, and his head was exhibited, I was well acquainted with many Mexicans who knew Joaquin well, and they all testified to the identity of the head, and agreed that this renowned bandit chief was now <em>muerte </em>(dead.) A Mexican woman at Mokelumne Hill, who had known Joaquin intimately, from childhood up, was much affected on seeing his head, and shed tears over it. The story of his still being alive and active must have been gotten up by the lovers of the marvellous. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock36.jpg
Rock37,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXVII. <br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co., <br />Cal., Nov. 23d, 1856.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>The grand Presidential campaign is ended, the forces have retired from the field, and as everybody certainly didn't expect, California has gone for &quot;Old Buck&quot; by a handsome majority. The mining counties all went the democratic ticket strong, owing probably to the large number of sympathizing bachelors in the mines. The foreigners too, mostly voted the democratic ticket. The election throughout the state passed off very quietly, and no riot or disturbance was anywhere created. </p><p>Now, is the &quot;game season&quot; in California, and the markets are filled to overflowing with geese, ducks, deer, antelope, hares, and all varieties of game, from a squirrel up to a grizzly bear. On this ranch, and all over the level bottom land near the bay, myriads of wild geese are to be seen in large flocks, sometimes of acres in extent, feeding upon the grain scattered by the last harvest. Hunters are in clover, and slaughter the geese with a perfect prodigality. They are generally found in the open fields, away from any fence, tree, or other cover for the hunter, so that it is difficult getting a shot at them, unless you take them on the wing. One pretty good method which is often practiced here, is hunting them with oxen. A hunter takes an ox trained for the purpose, and guiding him by means of a rope tied to his horns, drives him before him, following closely with gun in hand, thus using the ox as &quot;cover,&quot; until - the geese not being afraid of an animal - the concealed hunter is enabled to approach within gunshot, when of course he improves his opportunity; double barrelled guns make great havoc among them. </p><p>In the mountains of the coast range near here, the grizzly bear is often met with. Two hunters from this place succeeded in killing one the other day, weighing between six and seven hundred pounds. About two months ago a man in hunting for some stray horses, came suddenly upon two of these ferocious beasts. They at once attacked him, dragged him from his horse and tore him with teeth and claws in a horrible manner. They ended their pastime by rolling him off a high bank down a ravine, where he laid senseless until found by some of his friends a few hours afterwards. His horse made his escape with a few scratches, and coming home riderless, the friends of the missing man started at once in search. The blundering of the bears in pushing him over the precipice was the means of saving his life; for although after being taken home, he laid for some time in a very precarious state, I believe he has since about recovered from his injuries. He certainly had a very narrow escape. </p><p>The grizzly is a dangerous individual to interfere with, but as a general thing he will let you alone, if you will let him alone, and is rarely known to attack anyone unless suddenly disturbed, as in the instance just related, or when attacked by hunters, when he will stand at bay and show good fight, or judiciously retreat, as he may think most expedient. The grizzly is a brave beast, and when forced into a fight, as in case of a &quot;bull and bear fight,&quot; so often got up for the amusement of the public in times past, and occasionally practiced even now - he proves himself no coward, and has generally come off victorious. He is a clumsy unwieldly looking animal, but yet has the most effective sort of india rubber movement, uncomfortable to contemplate, even through the bars of a cage, and he is as quick with his fore paws, as a man is with his fists. The largest one I ever saw was at Sacramento on exhibition. He weighed fifteen hundred pounds, and is said to be the largest grizzly ever captured, although I have heard accounts of their being killed weighing upwards of two thousand pounds. </p><p>When very young the cubs are easily tamed, and make very playful pets. I have seen several of them - one especially in Stockton, which used to run about the streets just as he pleased, rolling and tumbling with the dogs. He was very rough in his play, and could tumble almost any dog in the city, so that his canine friends generally stood in fear of his sharp teeth and claws, which however he was, or at least endeavored to be, very careful in using, but one day, in playing with a big flop-eared hound, he became rather boisterous in his gambols, and at length got one of the poor dog's ears between his teeth, and neglected to let go, until <em>the ear came off. </em>After this exploit grizzle lost his liberty, for his master, the landlord of the Stockton House, put a chain to him, and kept him at home. </p><p>At Rich Gulsh in the Calaveras, I have often seen the grave of a young man who was actually frightened to death by grizzly bears. He had got lost in the mountains near there, and in making his way through the chapparal, came suddenly upon three large grizzlies, who pursued him until he took to a small tree, which he succeeded in climbing, and there he remained all night, just out of their reach, and they underneath shaking the tree, in their frequent attempts to climb after him, but the trunk was too small for them, as a grizzly bear cannot climb a tree that he can more than clasp around. All that long cold and dreary winter night he sat in the branches of the tree, crying and shouting for assistance, nervously watching the movements of his blood thirsty pursuers as they walked about growling, or sprang and climbed after him, at times almost reaching him. - Morning brought a large party of friends to his rescue, and the bears were driven away, but, poor fellow; wild with nervous excitement, and benumbed with the cold, he was assisted from the tree, and fainted on reaching the ground. When he was restored to consciousness he made out to walk home with his friends, but his mind wandered, and he talked incoherently in giving an account of the sad affair. Poor fellow; the terrors and expense of that awful night were too much for him; he was taken sick, and prostrated with a nervous fever. For a week he lay raving and delirious, and his heart-rending cries for help, as in his fevered imagination he still remained exposed in the fearful situation from which he was rescued, struck to the hearts of his surrounding friends. Medical aid was of no avail; he remained delirious, and during his week of sickness, <em>his black hair gradually turned completely gray. </em>He died. Nature could endure no longer and death came kindly to her relief. Beneath the old oaks on the hill side, they made his last resting place. The winter rains weep o'er his grave, and the bright summer flowers thickly bloom above him. There his troubled spirit finds rest, and through the autumn leaves the moaning winds sigh his requiem. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock37.jpg
Rock38,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXVII.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Dec. 23d, 1856.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>In my last letter, I related some stories of the grizzly bear, the animal so familiarly spoken of in connection with California and the Sierra Nevada mountains, and as anecdotes of the habits and peculiarities of the beast form a theme which may not be uninteresting to some of your readers. I will touch up the grizzly subject again. </p><p>In the early days of the gold discovery, &quot;prospecting&quot; parties and hunters often fell in with the grizzly bear in their wanderings, and many was the battle between this sovereign of the Sierra and his invading foe; but leaden balls, and long rifles, unlike the arrows of the Indians generally, proved too much for him, and steaks of bear meat often formed the meal of the hunter, and miner. He is still occasionally to be met with among the foot hills of the golden range, but his home is now high up in the snowy Sierra, where the prospecting miner rarely comes, and the hunter is not often seen. Among the mountains of the coast range, the grizzly is more frequently to be met with than in the Sierra Nevada, as here he is less troubled by miners and hunters. His food is principally the large sweet acorn so plentiful throughout California, together with various kinds of roots, which he readily digs up with his long sharp claws. He is fond of the young and tender shoots of the oak tree, and in the spring of the year I have often seen large limbs, broken down, which had been done by the bear in browsing. Standing upon his hind legs, with his powerful fore paws he reaches up and breaks down a limb, or bends it low enough for his purpose. </p><p>In the summer of '50, I was mining on the Calaveras river, near &quot;Hart's Bar.&quot; Several of us had noticed bear tracks in the vicinity for some time past, and one morning while all hands were at breakfast, an old Mexican came running into camp, breathless , and pale as his swarthy face would admit of, exclaiming <em>el oso! el oso!! </em>(the bear, the bear.) As soon as he was able to speak distinctly, he told us that in hunting for his mule just the other side of the hill from camp, he had suddenly come upon a large bear feeding upon the lower branches of an oak tree. When he first saw him he was so much frightened that he threw his <em>serapa </em>(blanket) at him, and struck out for camp as fast as he could travel. Great was the excitement created in our little community on the receipt of this intelligence. Hurrah for a bear hunt!! </p><p>All the guns in the camp were at once loaded with balls, or slugs. Several revolvers - &quot;Allen's pepper boxes&quot; all of them - were produced. (A poor weapon by the way. One could not much more that hit the side of a barn with one of them, at a dozen paces.) Blood-thirsty knives were buckled into belts of resolute individuals. Those not possessing regular weapons, shouldered axes, clubs, &amp;c., and one enthusiastic Hibernian, with two carving knives in his belt, flourished a heavy pick handle, <em>a la shillelagh, </em>and illustrated to us how he &quot;could give the baste three Connaught raps on the skull, while he was making one rake with his paw.&quot; He begged to have the pleasure of being the first one to attack &quot;Misther Bruin,&quot; and would like to show us &quot;how nately he could dispatch the animal, and lay him over without assistance.&quot; </p><p>These warlike preparations took but a short time, and away started the whole valiant little crowd of us, with the old greaser bringing up the rear, accompanying us as a guide, and ready to run, the minute he should get sight at the dreaded adversary. </p><p>Various were the plans of action, proposed. - Many were for marching right up, surrounding him, and giving him &quot;fits.&quot; Some were for all hands keeping together and attacking him <em>en masse, </em>and one timid individual suggested that we all get as near as possible to the bear, surrounding him, and then climbing trees, from which we could shoot at him, and if he attempted to attack us, we could slaughter him with perfect impunity. We soon arrived at the place, and carefully, and with great circumspection we advanced. But where was the bear? He had perhaps got wind of our intentions, and prudently <em>&quot;vamosed,&quot; </em>for he was nowhere to be seen. There lay the <em>serapa </em>of the Mexican, where he has thrown it when he took to his heels. - Bruin was probably about as much frightened as the old greaser was, and had left about the same time. There was the tree, and large broken branches lay scattered under it. Paddy with the pick-handle took a survey, and stoically remarked that &quot;if the grizzly divil could smash sich big limbs as them, what would a pick-handle be forninst him, sure.&quot; Peculiarly large, and deep tracks in the bed of a small stream near by, showed the direction Bruin had taken, but no one seemed inclined to follow him in the dense chapparal. We held a council of war on the spot, and decided that the most expedient course left to us, under the circumstances, was to go home again, which we accordingly did, fully impressed however, with the conviction that if the enemy had not evacuated the premises, we should certainly have massacred him at discretion. </p><p>His broad heavy tracks showed him to have been a terrible big fellow, and I have often, since then, shrewdly suspected that it was best for us that we did not find him, for few of us had ever seen a grizzly bear, and none of us knew any more about attacking one than so many goats would; and in case the bear showed fight, some poor fellow would most probably have got killed, or badly hurt in the melee that would have ensued. </p><p>When hard pushed by hunger, the grizzly will make a descent among the ranches, and help himself to pigs, or sheep. These he will capture by running them down, as a poor lean grizzly can run very fast, but a fat bear, like a fat man, may be classed among poor runners. - Hunger naturally makes him fierce, and unscrupulous, and woe to the luckless wight who may happen to fall in his way. When young and fat, grizzly meat is fine eating. It is tender, sweet, and juicy, and resembles pork in appearance and taste more than anything else I can think of, but when old and lean, the meat has a strong and not very agreeable taste. Although the grizzly is classed among carniverous beasts, yet he seems to have an aversion to a dead human body, as instances have been known of individuals - when beset by one of these ferocious beasts - throwing themselves flat on their faces, and by holding their breath as much as possible, and lying still as though they were dead, the bear would, after biting and scratching them a little, by way of examination, go away and leave them, apparently satisfied with his victory. The best place to shoot a grizzly is through the head, and a ball put in just back of his eye and near the ear is unquestionably a &quot;settler,&quot; Just behind the shoulder is the next best place, and a ball well put in there will generally do what is required; but he is very tenacious of life, and will fight for a long time, even when mortally wounded. </p><p>In the winter of '50 I knew a hunter by the name of Kirk, on the Calaveras, who used to follow hunting, entirely. He was an unerring shot, and with his long Kentucky rifle, he rarely failed to come in from a days hunt, without either plenty of venison, or a bear, and sometimes both. When on a bear hunt, he always went alone, and would have no one with him, as, in case he came across a grizzly, he wished to have the undivided attention of the beast directed towards himself alone. </p><p>He carried his rifle, a Colt's navy revolver, and a keen hunting knife. His usual method was to advance near enough to the bear to shoot him through the head, and kill him at the first shot, and if he failed in this, as the bear advanced upon him, he would dispatch him with his revolver, or knife. I do not know that he ever received so much as a scratch in his numerous encounters with the grizzly bear. He was from Missouri, was about six feet in height, a man of iron nerve, and a total stranger to fear. But, one day in the spring of '51, he started on his last hunt. He was absent beyond his usual time, and his friends becoming alarmed, a search was instituted, which resulted in his being found dead in the woods, some ten miles from home, with a bullet hole through his body, and two arrows sticking in his breast. His murderers were never discovered, although two Indians who were suspected to have done the deed, were shot by his friends. Poor Tom Kirk - On the Calaveras road, about a mile below Double Springs his remains lie buried. A piece of plank painted white, and bearing his initials - T. K. - stands at the head of his grave, and a neat white picket fence encloses the place where he sleeps, indicating to the passers by, the spot where rests one who was a faithful friend, an honest man, and as brave a hunter as ever carried a rifle. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock38.jpg
Rock39,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XXXIX.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Dec. 18<sup>th</sup>, 1856.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--<br /></p><p>Among the many vices peculiar to California, that of Gambling stands first and foremost. From the very first commencement of the rush and excitement, consequent upon the discovery of the gold, gambling, both publicly and privately, had been carried on to a wholesale extent, throughout the entire length and breadth of this State. In the early times of the gold excitement, merchants, miners, and the public generally, all seemed inclined to try their luck, and hundreds of thousands of dollars nightly changed hands at the gaming table. Laws regulating and suppressing public gambling had not been enacted, and in the fast cities and towns, large saloons were to be found, opening wide their doors upon the public street, and the many gaming tables groaning beneath bright piles of silver and glittering gold, stood temptingly displayed to induce the passers by, to enter the portals of the gambling house, and risk their money at some of the many games of chance, so plausible, set forth to entrap the unwary. </p><p>The principle saloons were rendered more attractive by having fine bands of music playing both day and night and along the walls were suspended fine picture s; many of them of a rather voluptuous character. The main source of profit to the proprietor of the saloon, was the bar, which occupied one side of the room and was generally a splendid affair, richly set off with cut glass decanters, of beautiful colors and patterns and a whole army of bottles of costly wines, liquors and syrups, rising one tier above another, while in the background, against the wall, hung large and costly mirrors, in splendid gilt frames. - The long counter was generally surmounted by marble slabs, and behind it stood spruce, active and intelligent bar traders, constantly busy at mixing and serving up the many and various drinks continually called for by the ever changing, ever thirsting crowd before them. At frequent intervals, the merry tinkle of a small bell would be heard, proceeding from some one or other of the gaming tables, announcing that the proprietor of that particular &quot;bank&quot; was desirous of &quot;treating&quot; his &quot;customers.&quot; The bell summoned an active waiter, who at once came and received his orders for various drinks, from the individuals who stood around the table, betting at the game. Hurrying to the bar he would soon return with the liquors called for, arranged on a salver, and serve them to those who wished. It was good policy on the part of the &quot;dealer&quot; to thus &quot;treat&quot; his victims as often as they wished, as, of course, a man under the influence of liquor would bet his money much more recklessly than one who was not.</p><p>In all the games, there was a large percentage in favor of the dealer, and those who bet their money at the game, generally lost. Occasionally they would be allowed to win a little, but this was only to lead them on, that they might be the more deeply and effectually fleeced. - Sometimes indeed, Fortune would favor the intended victim, and a bank perhaps be &quot;broke&quot; by some individual who had a most extraordinary run of luck; but this was seldom; although at all times most marvelous stories could be heard of such and such a bank having got &quot;broke&quot; by some lucky fellow. These stories were industriously circulated by the professional blacklegs, to encourage greenhorns to &quot;try their luck.&quot; </p><p>Many who were in San Francisco in '49 and '50, on reading this sketch, may readily call to mind the principle gambling saloon - the &quot;El Dorado&quot; - at the foot of the Plaza. Day and night it was filled with a gambling, curious crowd. - From the orchestra, a fine band of music discoursed delightful music, and fifty thousand dollars on one gambling table, could be seen there at any time. &quot;Monte,&quot; &quot;Roulette,&quot; &quot;Faro,&quot; and numerous other games were here in full operation, and a man with any money at all, could take his choice as to which game he would lose it on. The most common and familiar game played, &quot;Monte&quot; - a Mexican game - and at all hours could be heard the dealer of the game, as he shouted at the top of his voice, &quot;Come down gentlemen&quot; - &quot;Here's your chance for a pile&quot; - &quot;Pungle her down&quot; - &quot;Ace and King&quot; - &quot;Jack in the door,&quot; and such like expressions, connected with the game. </p><p>The principle gambling saloon in Stockton in '49 was owned by Mr. Rand a Methodist minister, from Cape May. He owned three or four of the Monte banks in his house and dealt Faro himself. He was a very quiet, respectable, fine looking man, and no one seeing him on the street, would have thought him a gambler. He left for home in the spring of '50, and was the proprietor of “<em>more gold than he could lift. </em>In one corner of this saloon, near the door, sat a boy, with dice box in hand, presiding over a table with some Alphabetical letters and a large bird painted on it, and of an evening his shouts could be heard above all the other gamblers, as he sung out &quot;Come down gentlemen.&quot; &quot;Here's the game called Chuckerluck; the less you put down, the more you pick up you're sure to win and can't lose.&quot; His favorite expression was, &quot;Buzzard bird, by chance, first time since supper.&quot; The idea was, that when the dice were shaken, if the &quot;Buzzard bird&quot; appeared uppermost, all the money which the anxious individuals betting at the game, had deposited upon various letters, was hopelessly confiscated to, and for the benefit of him of the dice box; and as the above mentioned favorite expression, by means of loaded dice was made to occur about every ten or fifteen minutes, we may suppose that the young man's word was not to be taken at all times. </p><p>I have given but a brief sketch of gambling as it was in California, and what more I would write on that subject I will reserve for my next letter. Wholesome statutes have been enacted, suppressing public gambling, and the &quot;El Dorado,&quot; and the other gambling hells, are among things that were; but, nevertheless gambling is still carried on in private places to a great extent. Many instances have been known of miners just down from the mines, betting their entire &quot;pile&quot; on a single card and wining; but was that money, made by gambling, as much prized, or as justly obtained, as that which was earned by honest toil in the mines? What honest man will say that a dollar fairly earned by the sweat of his brow, is not worth a dozen won at the gambling table?</p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock39.jpg
Rock40,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XL.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Jan. 3d, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: --</p><p>A &quot;happy new year&quot; to you. The old year has passed away, with its cares and vexations, to keep company with the many that have gone before it to the realms of the past. Let us look forward with hopeful hearts to brighter, happier days; hoping on, and hoping ever, that the trials and storms of the future may pass over us lightly. Adieu to the old year. Adieu to the events and troubles of the past, and trust in Providence for a happy future. </p><p>Thus far the winter has been mild. We have seen some frost and cold weather it is true, and ice has formed a quarter of an inch thick of a night, but the rains have held off so, that the ground has not wet down deep enough to plough until now. But we have had several good storms of rain within the last few days which has gladdened the hearts of the farming community, and everybody are actively engaged ploughing, and putting in their grain crops. The ranges of mountains which enclose this valley are white with snow, and the copious showers and strong south-east winds betoken the &quot;setting in&quot; of the rainy season. The farmers are all hopefully looking forward to a better season than was the last, and hope to make up for the short crops of the last harvest. </p><p>In my last letter, I spoke of gambling, as it existed in San Francisco, and other cities. In the towns and villages of the gold region, before the Act was passed by the Legislature, suppressing public gambling, the gaming table with its piles of money, was to be seen in all the gambling and drinking houses, and even in the grocery stores in retired parts of the diggings, gamblers would have their tables in a corner, and they generally did a brisk business evenings, and Sundays, with the miners and others who resorted there. Sunday has ever been the grand holiday throughout California. Among the Spanish portion of the community, Sunday was always the chosen day for a bull fight, horserace, and such like festivities. It has been accounted sinful to work at any manual labor on that holy day, and the miner looks with honest indignation upon his fellow, who desecrates the day of rest by wielding the pick and shovel when he should be washing his dirty clothing, or take his gun and go out on a day's hunt. They think: bah! a man should have more principle and regard for the good opinion of others than to <em>&quot;work </em>Sundays;&quot; and money made on that day will do him no good whatever, but will go to some bad use. </p><p>The miner generally does his principal &quot;trading&quot; Sundays. He washes the mud off his boots, puts on a clean shirt - if he has one - and his best hat, and goes &quot;to town,&quot; or else to &quot;the store&quot; in the vicinity, where he purchases his various articles in the provision line, and whatever other things he needs, and then - these business transactions being concluded if he is a person inclined to get drunk, he invariably does so and along towards sunset might be seen having a most unhappy time lugging his provisions home over the rocks and across the ravines. If he does not get drunk, he perhaps sits down at the gaming table in the corner, and <em>bucks </em>off what money he has about him at &quot;Monte,&quot; or again perhaps he sits down with a &quot;friend,&quot; and has a comfortable little game of &quot;Poker,&quot; and concludes the day by &quot;packing&quot; his provisions home on his back, and &quot;nary red&quot; in his pockets. But although dissipation and drunkenness stalk publicly through the mines and many a poor fellow easily led away becomes a victim, yet let not this be taken by any means as a type of the California miner. Thank Heaven, they are not all given to drunkenness and gambling; and God speed the glorious Era, the golden Era, when these vices at last may be unknown among them. </p><p>Among the many &quot;characters,&quot; of which it was my fortune to be cognizant in the mines, was one young gentleman of African lineage, Ethiopian parentage, sable complexion and his name was Pete Sykes. The first I saw of Pete, was in the fall of 1850, in Stockton, and he was then one of the proprietors of the &quot;Lone Star Restaurant&quot; there; and he was doing a fine business. Pete used to sport a gold watch and dress gay. He was a splendid cook, and indeed was hard to beat in that line, but the best of us have our faults, and Pete's grand failing was a strong inclination to venture his private funds on the game of &quot;Monte,&quot; and other chance investments. Gambling was the ruin of Pete Sykes. While he had plenty of money coming in he gambled freely, and the professional blacklegs bled him freely, until at last they won his last dollar and he lost his share in the Restaurant. </p><p>Pete Sykes was &quot;broke;&quot; and yet he had his &quot;stove&quot; left; his stove that he so much bragged on, and would not part with by any means. With <em>that </em>stove, Pete considered himself &quot;all right&quot; in the culinary department; and he was. He soon got a chance as cook in a hotel, and Pete and his stove drew plenty of customers to the house; but alas! his hard-earned wages in due course of time adorned the Monte banks; or some of his sable brethren would fleece him at &quot;Poker.&quot; Of this last game he was very fond, and would improve his spare time as often as he could get anyone to play with; frequently playing all night; until at last, the landlord of the hotel was obliged to discharge him. Of course the stove went with him, for Pete Sykes considered <em>that </em>stove as part and parcel of himself. He was a jolly looking darkey, black as a crow; his wool curling tight on his bullet shaped cranium, and his two lips rolled naturally away from each other, displaying in a most happy grin, as fine a set of dazzling white teeth as ever adorned the physiognomy of anyone. </p><p>The last I saw of Pete Sykes, he was at Mokelumne Hill, cooking in the &quot;Eagle Restaurant&quot; there. He was the same good humored, jolly, gambling darkey as ever, and had his usual luck in getting clear of his surplus wages. Ever ready for &quot;a game of Poker&quot; with his colored brethren, and often getting &quot;broke,&quot; yet he never could be induced to risk his stove, even when his last dollar was bet and lost. </p><p>But one unlucky evening, an eventful evening in the history of Pete Sykes and his stove, he sat playing &quot;Poker&quot; with another darkey. Pete's pocket had bled freely, and his excitement on this important occasion was aided by a horn or so of &quot;old Monongahela.&quot; Hand after hand was dealt, and Pete's treasury was fast becoming exhausted. The last hand was dealt; and Pete held &quot;four kings.&quot; His eyes glistened. - He went two dollars &quot;better.&quot; He trembled with joy and excitement. He &quot;had de nigger at last.&quot; He went ten dollars &quot;better.&quot; He put up his last dollar. He paused. &quot;Four kings&quot; was a hand that could hardly be beat. He was desperate. Looking the other darkey full in the face, he said with a most reckless tone of voice: - &quot;Nigger, I goes yer <em>a jint o' stove-pipe better.&quot; </em>Pete Sykes had broken the ice. - He was &quot;in for it.&quot; He went <em>&quot;anudder jint 0' stove-pipe better,&quot; </em>and yet &quot;anudder.&quot; He went <em>&quot;de lass jint;&quot; </em>and jumping up in his seat, he roared out: <em>&quot;Nigger I goes yer de whole stove better. </em>By gorry dis am Pete Sykes, last chance in California. I goes der whole stove.&quot; &quot;Pete Sykes,&quot; said his black antagonist, &quot;Pete, <em>I sees yer and sizes yer pile;&quot; </em>and at the same time he threw his hand upon the table, revealing to the astonished eyes of Pete &quot;four aces;&quot; the only hand in the whole pack that could beat his. He dashed his &quot;four kings&quot; down upon the floor, and strode forth from the room a sad-hearted, but not wiser, nigger. Poor Pete Sykes. His stove was gone, and he was indeed &quot;broke.&quot; </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock40.jpg
Rock41,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLI.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Jan. 18<sup>th</sup>, 1857.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Again has California been shaken, and the timid portion of the community frightened, by the shock of an earthquake. About 8 o'clock on the morning of the 9th inst. we experienced two distinct shocks. The first one was much the strongest, and lasted about four minutes, I should judge. No noise accompanied it, but it was a slow, steady, rocking motion, giving one a peculiarly dizzy sensation, and the oscillations appeared to be about S. E. and N. W. In San Francisco door bells were rung, some brick walls were cracked, a small house which stood up on stilts was thrown down, and many people were much frightened, and ran out into the streets. These small shakings seem to be becoming fashion able in this peculiar portion of Uncle Sam's dominions, but as they do little or no damage, they are not much to be feared. </p><p>Among the many peculiarities of this country, I would like to write a few words on a somewhat delicate subject, and that is the <em>vermin </em>with which all who reside in California become more or less familiar in spite of themselves. I believe no one ever came here that did not soon discover the fact that <em>fleas </em>were plenty and more easily acquired than money, and indeed cling to a person longer and far more pertinaciously than dollars . They are to be found everywhere, in the wigwam of the Indian and in the mansions of the wealthy, in the saloons, in the hotels, in the miner's cabin; everything and everybody has fleas. The proudest merchant or the handsomest lady that walks the streets of San Francisco are victims alike to these blood-thirsty, skipping little rascals. Everybody has to scratch. The extreme of cleanliness is not proof against them; they are natural to the climate and country and will insinuate themselves where they please. They are a pest and a nuisance, but they are nevertheless a &quot;fixed fact&quot; and cannot be avoided. </p><p>In the early times of the gold excitement, when everybody was travelling hither and thither throughout the country in search of riches, they found that the fleas followed them, but they also found another, more quiet species of vermin, and that was <em>lice. </em>In all the hotels and lodging houses were long tiers of &quot;bunks&quot; for the accommodation of travellers, and the bedding consisted of straw mattresses, and woolen blankets. Every night a new lot of travellers occupied these beds, and as in these days but little attention was paid to personal appearance or cleanliness, the blankets soon abounded in varieties of the vermin. The many ships arriving daily, with their swarms of passengers from all parts of the globe, brought additional vermin. In the mines the Indians kept up the supply, for lice are peculiarly natural to a Digger Indian, as fleas are to a dog; and the Spanish population, too, generally, did not lack much for the commodity, so that, what between shipping them here to add to the plentiful stock already on hand, the mining, speculative, travelling public, soon became altogether a lousy public. It was almost considered a sign of good health to have plenty of lice, and to accuse your neighbor of being &quot;lousy&quot; was merely &quot;the pot calling the kettle black.&quot; </p><p>An anecdote is told of an individual in Stockton who stood one morning exercising his back in a peculiar manner against the corner of the &quot;EI Dorado,&quot; when an acquaintance, meeting him, said: &quot;What's the matter Jim, fleas?&quot; - &quot;Fleas? no!&quot; replied Jim, &quot;d--n you, do you think I'm a dog? fleas? no; <em>lice!&quot; </em>Cleanliness and comfort, among the white population at least, have caused these indications of filth to pass away, to be spoken of as connected with former times, but the Spaniards and the Indians, not being progressive in that respect, their natural vermin still clings to them. Well, this <em>is </em>rather of a scaly subject for a newspaper letter, but as it's all true, I'll excuse it on that ground. Ask any &quot;old Californian&quot; if it is not so. </p><p>The mosquitoes - that extremely annoying little insect, - are most plentiful on the rivers, and especially the San Joaquin and Sacramento, where clouds of them, in the warm season, eternally hover over the still waters or infest the <em>tules </em>and rank grass that crown the low banks and bottom lands along the rivers and sloughs, ever hungry, waiting for a victim, and ready to pounce in blood-thirsty myriads upon man or beast. In the spring of '50, I was for a short time &quot;mate&quot; of the little sloop &quot;Alia Clinton.&quot; The only person besides myself was Capt. F--, and consequently we constituted both &quot;crew&quot; and &quot;cook.&quot; We were engaged in the freighting business between San Francisco and Stockton, and in our trips up and down the San Joaquin we became thoroughly acquainted with the mosquito and its general disposition to &quot;bite.&quot; From the time we entered the mouth of the river until we had been up to Stockton and back, we fought mosquitoes day and night; we killed them by millions, &quot;but the cry was still they come.&quot; They came with a rush and always lit stinger end first; a blotch followed the sting, and blotch followed blotch, until a river boatman could be easily distinguished by the &quot;mosquito bites&quot; on his face and hands. - There was no such thing as sleeping comfort able, where they were. We rolled ourselves up in blankets, but it was no use; the mosquitoes crawled through like so many fleas. Hard work and exposure under the boiling sun by day, and to the mosquito, miasma and damps of the river air by night, was more than I could stand. I had to quit boating, and a long and severe siege of the &quot;fever and ague&quot; justified me in the conclusion that I was not cut out for a &quot;fresh-water sailor,&quot; or destined to become celebrated in the annals of river navigation. </p><p>In San Francisco and other cities, myriads of &quot;rats&quot; find their abode. Under the planking of the streets, in the great warehouses, in the flimsy wooden shanties, in the old hulks, around the rotten and filthy wharves and docks, they breed and swarm in endless profusion. Passing along the streets of San Francisco of an evening, a stranger would be surprised to see the droves of rats running about, feeding upon the offal and hardly caring to run out of one's way. It is of no use killing them, for that does not thin them out any, and an old resident of San Francisco, seeing a man chasing and trying to kill the rats in the streets evenings, knows at once that he is a stranger in the city and probably just down from the mines. They were pretty well killed out, for a time, by the great fires which used so to devastate and destroy that thriving city, but in a few months they were plentier than ever. I think the many long-tailed children of the Celestial Empire who reside in San Francisco must have a happy time of it, and can defy starvation where rats are so plenty. I never passed one of the Chinese butcher shops on Sacramento street and viewed the various shaped articles of the &quot;sassinger&quot; order, without wondering how many carcasses of defunct rats it took to make those queer looking sausage. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p><p>---</p><p>Whoever can read Ben Bolt’s letter this week, without <em>scratching</em>, will do to live in California, and will never be troubled with <em>backbiters.</em></p>",public://rock/Rock41.jpg
Rock42,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLII. <br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co., <br />Cal., Feb. 3d, 1857.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK: --</p><p>Of the numerous, and various reptiles which infest the mountain regions of California, the rattlesnake may be set down as the most dangerous, although few are the instances of anyone being bitten by them, notwithstanding the carelessness of miners and travellers, in making their camps, and sleeping on the ground where these deadly reptiles are known to abound. </p><p>In the winter season, the &quot;rattler&quot; is rarely seen, but in the hot dry summer months, they crawl from their holes and hiding places; and in the dry grass on the arid hill-sides, in the dry ravines, and in the chapparal, they are very frequently met with. They are generally from three to five feet in length, and I have seen them larger round than my wrist. Their color is a sort of dingy brown mottled with black, and white. When they are two years old, they have only one rattle; this is called the &quot;button,&quot; and is of different shape from the rest; each succeeding year, another rattle appears, and thus the age of the snake is easily ascertained. The oldest and largest one I ever saw, had seventeen rattles, and was four feet ten inches in length. They are an indolent, cowardly sort of a snake, and had always rather run, than fight. I have frequently when happening to come across one, tried him, from motives of curiosity, to see how far he could spring, by poking, and stirring him up with a stick; and found that they cannot spring their length; but only so far as to conveniently drop back into the coil again, their tail not leaving the ground. They would always endeavor to get away, and I could hardly induce them to strike at the stick, although they rattled fiercely all the while. The rattle has a sharp, hissing, startling sound, and when the snake is fairly aroused and alarmed, he keeps up a vigorous rattling. At certain seasons of the year they appear to be dormant, and sleepy, so that oftentimes, a person may almost tread upon one lying coiled up in the grass, without the reptile giving the least warning. I mowed over one once with a scythe, and came near stepping directly upon him before he sprung his rattle. This was near Double Springs; and during the haying season, we used to kill at least a dozen snakes a day, of various kinds. When we were spreading the hay, mornings, under every cock of it, we would find snakes that had crawled under, during the night. They were mostly of a kind called &quot;gopher&quot; snakes, resembling the rattlesnake in size and appearance, but are not venomous, and are so named, from their living upon &quot;gophers,&quot; - a sort of field mouse - rats, &amp;c. The fangs of the rattlesnake are from a quarter, to half an inch in length; sharp as needles white and a little curved. They are situated in the upper jaw, and are movable; shutting into a sort of sheath, like the claw of a cat, and at the root of the fang, is the deadly poison. In making an attack, the snake springs forward in the coil, with open mouth, and fangs projecting, and death is the portion of the unfortunate victim. The body of the rattlesnake may be eaten with perfect impunity, as all the poison is contained in the head, and I have seen men who said they have eaten them, and they pronounced them &quot;fine eating;&quot; almost equal to eels. Well, a dish of fried rattlesnakes may be excellent in their way, .and perhaps hard to beat, but I cannot say that I ever felt extremely anxious to test their delectable qualities as an article of diet. </p><p>The Centipede is a sort of worm from three to six inches in length, with a great profusion of short legs. Some of these reptiles are brown, but they are mostly of a greenish color, and are found in plenty in the mining region, generally about old dead trees, in old houses, and such like places, as well as in the ground. They are said to be very poisonous, and can bury all their legs at once into a person's flesh, as each leg is a fang of itself. </p><p>The scorpion looks for all the world like a very small lobster, or crawfish in shape, and is generally from one to three inches in length. It varies in color, from green to a light brown, and its curved sting: or fang, is in the end of its tail. With its large claws it seizes upon an object, and then throwing its tail over its head, plies its sharp sting. A friend of mine once was stung in the finger by one of them, and he describes the sensation as quite painful; he at once laid the wound open with his pocket-knife, and putting the finger to his mouth, sucked out all the poison he could, and then bound a wet piece of tobacco on the wound. His finger swelled a little, but was soon well again. The scorpion is found like the centipede, in old dead timber, under rocks, and in the ground. </p><p>The Tarantula is an enormous black spider, with legs two or three inches long, and the body is as large as the end joint of one's thumb. The legs are stout, and together with the body, are covered with short grayish down or hair. They are good at jumping, when making an attack, but are generally slow and deliberate in their motions. They have a stout pair of black fangs in their head, which come together like a pair of pincers. They live in holes in the ground, and are certainly a most hideous looking object. They also, are said to be very venomous. </p><p>Of the various reptiles of which I have spoken, but few are to be found in this locality. –They belong to the mountain regions, and are the daily companion of the gold miner. It is a source of wonder, that so few get bitten by them, for they are often found inside of the miner's cabin, or tent, and even among his blankets, sometimes. All of these venomous reptiles, even to the rattlesnake, I have myself killed, inside of my own tent when in the mines. But – </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock42.jpg
Rock43,"<p>No. XLIII<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co. Cal.<br />Feb 18<sup>th</sup> 1857.</p><p>Dear Rock: *(poetry verse in here.) on last page</p><p>Throughout the world there is an abundance of musicians of various merit, but in the number - not quality - of musicians, I think California can take the lead. From San Francisco to Nevada you cannot find half a dozen men together but some one or more of their number can play on an instrument of some kind, if nothing but a pair of &quot;bones.&quot; Everybody is supposed to be able to whistle except the Chinese; indeed I never saw or heard of a Chinaman that could whistle. All Yankees, of course, whistle because it is part of their nature to do so, but I would almost as soon think of seeing a pig whistle, as one of these long tailed Celestials. </p><p>All who were here in '49 and '50 can well recollect the bands of music that used to play in the numerous gambling and drinking saloons, both day and night. Some of these were fine bands too, and the music formed the principal attraction, as anyone going in to listen to the music was quite likely to patronize the bar or risk some of their loose change on a game of &quot;Monte.&quot; These musicians were paid an &quot;ounce&quot; (sixteen dollars) per day, which one might suppose was pretty good wages. If that notable band that we remember of in days &quot;lang syne,&quot; the &quot;Calithumpians&quot; had been here then they would have stood as good a chance as any of them and made dollars by the hatful. </p><p>On all public occasions, a bull fight or a horse race, music was indispensable, and even the funeral processions were preceded by a band performing the mournful dirge</p><p>Music of all kinds was well patronized and encouraged. From Italy's sunny clime, came the dark eyed street organist, with ever grinning and dancing images and active regimental monkey. The daughters of Germany came with extensive straw hats and blue ribbons, to charm the street audiences with tambourine and accordion, and pleasant little ballad ditties sung with their sweet German accent. And when the pretty tamborine girl would come round, holding out the tamborine so bewitchingly, &quot;bits&quot; and &quot;quarters&quot; involuntarily leaped forth, happy to claim so sweet an owner. There also came the man who perambulated the streets with big bass drum, bells, Pan pipers, triangle, &amp;c, and who astounded the gaping crowd by performing on all these instruments of noise at one and the same time. The two had a monkey, a genius of a monkey, a discriminating monkey. That monkey could tell &quot;bits&quot; from buttons, and &quot;quarters&quot; from coppers; you couldn't humbug him. He was a business monkey, a receiving cashier and paying teller. An honest monkey that never pocketed any of the funds, for he had no pocket. </p><p>The hurdy-gurdy man, with the bird call in his mouth also pervaded the streets with his dulcet strains of grinding harmony. Throw a &quot;bit&quot; down to him, and hear how clear and happy the bird notes sing out from his mouth. Hear how he warbles furth his gratitude, as some one tosses him a “quarter”. And how he trills with ecxtacy as benevolence throws him half a dollar. Try him with a button, somebody. </p><p>One purple nosed individual with ambitious eyes and velveteen pants, lugs round a cumbrous article of the reed organ variety, and &quot;Phoenix&quot; says it only plays one tune - &quot;The Low back car&quot; - but in this he is mistaken, for every moonlight evening he causes it to perform &quot;Oft in the stilly night.&quot; He commences by turning the crank slowly and gently, &quot;can expressione,&quot; but if any money at all is thrown to him he becomes excited, and involuntarily quickens the time with a &quot;crescendo&quot; movement until a descending quarter increases it to a sort of gallopade quickstep, when the significant shutting of windows or closing of blinds notifies him to leave. </p><p>An improved feature in street music, however, is a company of enterprising young Germans - some half dozen of them - with white bands round their caps and they are really good performers. Each one of them carries a light music stand with three movable legs, and all play brass instruments. In front of the principal hotels and public places they halt, place their stands, open their books, and perform some of the popular airs, opera music &amp;c in a highly creditable manner. The public appreciate their music, and they generally receive considerable pecuniary encouragement in their rounds. There are many excellent military bands, theatre bands, quadrille bands &amp;c, and the majority of the good musicians are Germans. </p><p>The musical taste of the California public seems to run mostly on ballad singing, therefore some of the most notable opera singers meet with but little encouragement here. Ballads such as we used to hear at home seem to strike a chord in the hearts of sojourners here with peculiar fitness. &quot;Do they miss me at home,&quot; &quot;Old Folks at home&quot; and such like pieces are among the most popular ballads. They are generally sung in the theatres first, and then, presented to the public, soon become very popular. Old pieces which were sung out at home, become renovated and as good as new here. </p><p>In '51 Madame Von Gulpen - German singer of considerable merit, and very pretty withal- sung &quot;Jeanette and Jeanette&quot; at the Adelphi theatre. She had a fine voice, and her interesting foreign accent gave to the execution of the piece an indescribable charm and it became a popular favorite directly. The merchant hummed it over at his desk, the mechanic sung it as he kept time with the strokes of saw and hammer, and the boys whistled it in the streets. A year or two ago some one sung &quot;Be kind to the loved ones at home,&quot; in one of the theatres and although it lacked considerable of being a new piece, yet it seemed new to the public and received its due share of popularity. </p><p>Negro minstrelsy receives a goodly portion of public patronage and the &quot;San Francisco Minstrels&quot; have long been performing at their hall on Washington street to full houses every evening. In truth they are all excellent performers, and most deservedly popular. They sing ballads, sentimental, doleful, or humorous, and negro melodies, have plenty of music, dancing, jokes, stories, and also perform droll little plays suited to their line of acting. An evening at one of their performances is now known to be a sure cure even in the last stages of the &quot;blues.&quot; Numerous bands of darky minstrels travel from town to town throughout the state and especially in the mining localities, and some of them realize considerable sums of money in this way. </p><p>The violin, so well called &quot;King of instruments,&quot; the violin, which in the hands of Old Bull or Paganini breathed forth sounds soft as sighs of angels or gaily rang clear and loud in heart gladdening harmony. That instrument of greater compass and variety of tone than any other, capable of music most divine and of strains the most execrable and soul-harrowing. The violin, the &quot;fiddle,&quot; is more performed upon and abused in the performance in California than anywhere else in the world. It claims all sorts of performers here, from creditable imitators of the great masters down to the common &quot;Pike county&quot; fiddler. </p><p>In the mines is the violin most especially abused. There is no lack of fiddlers there- go into any, even the most retired portions of the diggings, and you will find both fiddles, and fiddlers. Even the Chinese, although they can boast of but little talent in that line, have an occasional fiddle among them, not such an instrument as the &quot;genus homo&quot; generally perform upon, but a peculiar fiddle of their own getting up, which when operated upon by a Celestial fiddler, sounds are produced closely resembling the heart broken wails of a despairing tom cat. </p><p>Two years ago now, I was pretty well acquainted at &quot;Indian Diggings&quot; and I think that about every other man in the place was fiddler, either good, bad, or indifferent, mostly however of the latter class. One night that I was there, I tarried at the cabin of a friend. After supper several of the boys from the neighboring cabins came in and we made up quite a social little party. Pipes were smoked, stories were told, cards were played, and my friend produced his fiddle and gave us a specimen of his musical powers. He then passed it to me and another. Each one showed us what he could do at it, and I was not a little amused to find that out of a dozen of us, all except one could play, and that one wasn't me, either, for I took my turn at it too. Western fiddlers, and especially those from Missouri, tune their strings in a way that gives their music a peculiar sort of a wild yet not unpleasing sound, and all of them are sure to be able to play &quot;The Arkansas Traveller,&quot; and &quot;The Galan the log,&quot; two remarkable tunes which in their estimation are as much ahead of &quot;Hail Columbia&quot; as that is ahead of &quot;Jim, along Josey.&quot; </p><p>Adios, </p><p>Ben Bolt. </p><p>*List ye now to music sweet<br />The hurdy gurdy’s in the street<br />The tambourine is loudly singing<br />and the organ man is singing.</p>",public://rock/Rock43.jpg
Rock44,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLIV.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., March 3d, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -- </p><p>Among the emigrants from the different parts of the States, which help to make up the population of California, it is quite amusing to note the little peculiarities of habits, looks, and speech, which distinguish the natives of each particular State or portion of the Union from each other. </p><p>The &quot;Southerner&quot; is not the man who does the hardest work here. He generally prefers some method of getting along in the world which has not much of manual labor attached to it; - an easy mercantile life, offices in the county, or State service, or something of that sort is just what suits him. The great fillibuster - Walker - is a southerner, and most of those who are with him, or sympathise with him, are southerners. They imagined Nicaragua to be their land of promise, and easily to be acquired; a land of milk and honey, and abounding in rich lands, where the &quot;Domestic institution&quot; of slavery could be introduced; and there on their rich plantations, with all the comforts of a southern home around them, they would lead a happy, comfortable, southern life, and no meddling &quot;down-east abolitionists&quot; to bother them. Thus far they have been somewhat disappointed. </p><p>The &quot;Yankee&quot; is quite another individual. Ever ready, active, energetic, and intelligent, with the desire to make money always uppermost, he leaves no stone unturned to effect his object. If there is any great enterprise gotten up, such as a railroad, an express line branching to all parts of the country, it grand combination of stage lines, or steamboat routes; to facilitate public travel, and at the same time to draw dollars plentifully from the pockets of the public, you may be sure that some Maine or Massachusetts men are at the bottom of it. </p><p>All the rowdy butchers, rampant fire companies, shoulder-strikers and b'hoys generally, are from New York, although at the same time, as talented and enterprising men come from there, .as from any other State, yet there always seemed to me to be a sort of New York-ishness about a native of that State, not easily to be mistaken. </p><p>Thus each State is distinguished by the manners, customs, and peculiarities of its sons. But it is not often that a particular <em>county </em>becomes thus celebrated. Who is there in California who does not know in what part of the world &quot;Pike County&quot; is, and who has not seen a &quot;Pike?&quot; Pike County, Missouri, will be ever celebrated in the annals of the settlement of California. Whether the people of that immortal county are more migrating in their habits, or were more easily excited by the news of the great gold discovery here, than other people, I cannot say; but certain it is, that in '49 and '50, anyone meeting a train of emigrants, just arriving into the country across the Plains, and asking them where they were from, the almost invariable answer was &quot;Pike County.&quot; It was unnecessary to mention the State, for &quot;Missouri&quot; was as a matter of course understood. In fact some of the least learned among them are under the impression that Missouri is part of Pike County; and they have some grounds for believing so, as all the Missourians here now-a-days are included in the designation of &quot;Pikes.&quot; </p><p>Generally speaking, the Pikes are, as a class, the most illiterate, coarse, ignorant, and rough set of people we have among us. The most of them follow mining, or farming, and are not always considered very agreeable neighbors. There are of course some fine people among them as are to be found anywhere; but the generality of them are as I have described. </p><p>The numerous daughters of Pike blooming in this golden land, go far towards making up for the lack of personal attractions on the part of the male Pikes, and had they not such big feet I could perhaps think some of them pretty. But such feet; - and occupying such an extent of sole leather - why, they are as large as men's feet. I must confess to an amiable weakness in favor of a pretty little foot, and would consider a reigning belle, with ever so pretty a face, comparatively homely, if she wore long dresses to hide a pair of big ugly feet. Therefore it is that we may not consider the Pike County damsels as excelling the Yankee girls in personal beauty. To use their classic style of speech, they have a &quot;right smart chance&quot; of a foot. </p><p>Although ignorant, rude, and in some things perhaps disagreeable, yet in many points, Pike is - as Micawber would say - &quot;a good fellow.&quot; Ever the pioneer in the advance of civilization extending westward, it is by such as him, that forests are cleared, and the foundations of cities laid. The race of the red man fades away before him, and the lofty old trees which shade the ancient hunting grounds, fall before the ringing axe of the Western emigrant. As a rifle shot, Pike can hardly be beat; and were an expedition organized to go out into the Indian country, to fight the savage foe in his own stronghold, I would infinitely prefer Pike with his rude manners, and trusty rifle, to a legion of city bucks, and those who think themselves the very flowers of society.</p><p>Pike is universally ridiculed, and looked down upon by many, who, were they &quot;weighed in the balance,&quot; might be themselves found wanting; yet he possesses qualities which do honor to manhood; and although cute Yankees see plenty to ridicule, and make fun of in Pike, yet rude in speech, and rough in manners as he may be, and profoundly ignorant in regard to book learning, and things that to us are familiar, in the mysteries of woodcraft, and things which fall under the observation of the pioneer, there be many points in which &quot;Pike&quot; can teach &quot;Yankee.&quot; Yes; and sometimes Pike stumbles into the performances of a &quot;cute Yankee trick,&quot; should occasion require. </p><p>In the early days of '47 there were no regular pilots about San Francisco bay, and ships had to find their way into port, or across the bays and up the rivers, as best they could; and ship captains were willing to give almost any price for some one who had an inkling as to where the true channel lay, and could pilot them up the rivers. I recollect we had to pay an individual a good round sum - $400 I think - to pilot our ship up as far as the mouth of the San Joaquin river - about fifty miles - where he left us, stuck hard and fast in the mud. </p><p>It so happened that one day an anxious captain was about the landing at Clark's point , inquiring for some one to pilot his ship up to Sacramento , and offering plenty of money; but no one seemed willing to take the responsibility - At length he was accosted by a gentleman dressed in a blue blanket coat, a pair of butternut pants, and an old felt hat, who &quot;reckoned he was the man for him,&quot; and could &quot;jest take his boat anywhar he'd like to go.&quot; The captain asked him if he was thoroughly acquainted with the navigation of the Sacramento, and he &quot;reckoned he was;&quot; he'd &quot;been thar,&quot; - he had. So there was no more to say; his services were engaged forthwith. </p><p>Now this gentleman had just arrived across the Plains from Pike, some two weeks previously, and had come down on the last &quot;scow&quot; from Sacramento, thus he did know something about where the river was; and hearing the captain inquiring for a pilot, thought it would be a most desirable chance for making a &quot;raise,&quot; and besides that, he wanted to go up to Sacramento, and would rather pocket money, than pay it out for his passage up. </p><p>The gallant ship was soon underweigh, and spreading her snowy pinions to the fresh sea breeze. The bays of San Francisco, and San Pablo were safely crossed, our &quot;pilot&quot; carefully abstaining from giving orders, and sensibly contenting himself by hinting to the captain as to the right direction to go in. Thus he got along very well, until they had passed up through the straits of Carquinez, and were crossing Suisun bay, towards the mouth of the river; and as this bay is remarkable for shoals, Pike was put to his trumps. He however held his tongue, and keeping a sharp eye on the landmarks, trusted to his luck. </p><p>Presently the captain touched him on the elbow, saying &quot;pilot isn't it rather shoal water here?&quot; Pike &quot;reckoned it was rayther shoal&quot;- indeed the water had assumed a dirty green color, indicating shoals - and thinking that if they could only get into the blue water to the left they would be &quot;all right,&quot; he proceeded to give orders to that effect. He turned to speak to the captain, but he had gone forward to look out ahead. There was no time to lose, so turning to the man at the wheel, and endeavoring to look as pilot-ish as possible, Pike sung out : <em>&quot;l say stranger, let her come haw a little.&quot; </em>As a matter of course, such an order produced a roar of laughter from all hands. It was the ruination of Pike; and even as they were laughing, a heavy grating was felt; the ship gave a surge and a thump, and directly was fast aground. The captain swore terribly, but there was no help for it. Pike took the curses and the ridicule like a philosopher. The next day they made out to get off the shoal, and by sounding and feeling their way along, they managed to get safely into the mouth of the river, and by good management, aided by what little Pike knew, they contrived in about a week to work the ship safely up to Sacramento. Here in consideration of his valuable services Pike received fifty dollars, as a present from the captain. He at once got all hands ashore - cook and all - and &quot;stood treat ;&quot; after which he was seen walking off up J street, swaying himself from side to side in a truly nautical manner, and appearing to feel that he was the greatest pilot on the Pacific coast. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock44.jpg
Rock45,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLV.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., March 17<sup>th</sup>, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:-- </p><p>With the first early rains last fall, the farmers commenced in various places, ploughing, and putting in grain. As the season progressed, the weather gave but little encouragement, and many were deterred from putting in crops, from not having sufficient rain to soften the ground enough for ploughing purposes. They began to fear too that we should have another dry season like the last and consequently as short crops. Nevertheless, many farmers concluded to &quot;risk it,&quot; and did put in considerable crops. The copious rains of the latter part of February, completely reassured every one, and during the past three or four weeks, thousands of acres have been ploughed, and sown with grain. Everywhere the crops are coming forward finely, and the prospect at present is, that we shall have a heavier crop of grain this season than ever before, and California will raise more than sufficient to supply herself with breadstuffs, and have some for exportation.</p><p>The notorious Ned McGowan, that the Vigilance Committee pursued so hotly, a few months ago, for being accessory to the assassination of James King of William, is reported to have &quot;turned up&quot; within a few days at Sacramento where he has given himself into the hands of the civil authorities for safety, and is willing to stand trial for what he is charged with. He has been in concealment near Santa Barbara for the last four months; and now the Vigilance Committee being disbanded, and all the excitement blown over, he has deemed it safe to venture back here again. </p><p>Ned should have a care as to where he steps for he is walking on volcanic ground. If he had been captured at the time the Committee were after him, salt would hardly have saved him; and even now, there be many in San Francisco who would not hesitate to string him up to a lamp post, upon the first show of a pretense. </p><p>In my last letter, I had for my subject &quot;Pike County,&quot; and those specimens of human family who emanate from there - the &quot;Pikes&quot;; - and a pleasing little reminiscence connected with my experience of them, occurring to me just now, I will here relate it. </p><p>It was in the spring of '53. I had been out all day, searching for a stray horse along the rich bottom lands that border the Calaveras river, and as the shades of evening gathered around, I struck the Stockton road and pressed forward to reach &quot;Pixley's ranch,&quot; in order to partake of his hospitalities and enjoy a good night's rest after my wearisome tramp. As I approached the house, I noticed that it wore a most cheerful appearance, with floods of joyous light gleaming from the windows, and as I drew nearer I heard a great clattering of feet and mirthful voices mingling with the merry notes of the violin. I hastened to enter and found myself in the midst of a regular Pike &quot;rakedown.&quot; - There were some fifteen or twenty couples in all, dancing away for dear life to the music produced by a vile performer on the violin, who was posted .up on a flour barrel in one corner, scraping away most energetically, utterly regardless of tune or time, and apparently only endeavoring to produce as much noise as possible. They were dancing in the bar-room, which was a large room of about twenty-five by forty, and they were all &quot;Pikes,&quot; every soul of them. </p><p>I shook hands with Pixley - as fine a fellow as ever emigrated from the immortal County - and he informed me that the occasion of the present jollification was the birth-day of his eldest daughter, a passable young Miss of fifteen. He had thought it a good occasion for getting up a &quot;ball,&quot; and therefore sent out invitations to the ranches around. After partaking of a substantial meal in the kitchen, he cordially invited me to &quot;go in&quot; and enjoy the frolic with the rest, but being very tired, and besides unacquainted with anyone except the landlord, I declined, and seated myself by the big log fire which comforted the room and enjoyed myself by looking on and &quot;taking items.&quot; </p><p>Cotillions were danced; &quot;Virginia Reel,&quot; and another Reel that I never saw or heard of, before or since. The &quot;prompter,&quot; - a tall, rawboned ox-driver - stood next the fiddler, and gave off his orders in a loud nasal voice, the principal part of his knowledge in regard to cotillions being limited to &quot;Right and left,&quot; &quot;Balance thar,&quot; &quot;Ladies chain,&quot; &quot;Balance thar,&quot; &quot;All promenade,&quot; &quot;Balance thar,&quot; and as he &quot;called off&quot; these remarkable figures in rapid succession, he continued to keep the whole crowd &quot;hoeing it down,&quot; which they did with a right good will, oftentimes when going through with the &quot;Balance thar&quot; move, almost entirely drowning the sound of the fiddle. </p><p>Near where I sat, a young lady was seated, whom Pixley introduced as Miss Frony Sykes - a very fat, rosey-cheeked young lady with black hair, large black eyes, and - of course - a pair of lumping great feet. I thought I should hate to furnish corns for <em>her </em>to tread on. On the strength of the introduction, I tried to get up a conversation, but she seemed very diffident, only answering &quot;yis sir,&quot; and &quot;no sir,&quot; to my questions and sage observations; although her dark eyes plainly indicated that she would be glad to think of &quot;something to say.&quot; I asked her why she was not dancing and she said, &quot;can't&quot; - &quot;dunno how.&quot; I then spoke of the route across the Plains and the trials to which a woman must be subjected on the long and tedious journey, of the objects of curiosity which I had heard spoken of as to be seen on the road, of &quot;Court House rock,&quot; &quot;Chimney rock,&quot; &amp;c. - She said she'd &quot;seed 'em all&quot;, and &quot;clumb part way up Chimbly rock.&quot; After this she subsided again and I could hardly get a word out of her for some time, but at length, in a sudden fit of eloquence, she informed me that the last &quot;eend&quot; of the route their &quot;team gin clean out,&quot; and consequently she had to &quot;walk three hundred mile.&quot; Again she became reserved, and could only say &quot;yis sir,&quot; and &quot;no sir,&quot; but I could see, by the admiring roll of her pretty eyes, that I had made an &quot;impression.&quot; Indeed I felt myself quite irresistible, and considered that it was entirely at my own option as to whether I would make Frony Sykes Mrs. Bolt or not. </p><p>Reels and cotillions followed in rapid succession till about 11 o'clock, when all hands concluded to have a rest. Songs were called for and one after another gave us his &quot;favorite song.&quot; The raw-boned prompter, sitting near by me, noticed some traces of India ink on my arm - as the sleeves of my blue flannel shirt were partially rolled up - and looking me full in the face, he said &quot;Stranger, ain't you a sailor?&quot; I acknowledged that I had once been in the habit of climbing ropes on board ship. Said he, &quot;Well then, salt water, you give us a sea song,&quot; and notwithstanding that I assured him I was no singer, he roared out at the top of his voice: “Hello! a song from this 'ere sailor feller.&quot; A song! a song! was shouted from all hands, and making a virtue of necessity, I sung them, &quot;A wet sheet and a flowing sea.&quot; I did the best I knew how, for the admiring eyes of Frony Sykes were upon me, and as I concluded the song, the heavy boots of my audience seemed emulous of destroying the planking of the floor, the whole assemblage of &quot;border ruffians&quot; were so ferociously delighted. I sang them two or three more songs with equal success, feeling that each song was but another shot sent into that fast yielding citadel, the heart of Frony Sykes. There was one long lank &quot;ruffian,&quot; with a terrible big pair of cow-hide boots on, who sat with open mouth, and two great oysters of eyes, staring directly at me, and at the conclusion of each song, he would at once ask me if I didn't &quot;know another one.&quot; He seemed to think me a &quot;powerful good singer.&quot; </p><p>Dancing was proposed again and all hands were soon on the floor, refreshed and ready to go it again stronger than ever. As for my own part, I began to think of going up to bed, and in fact should have done so long before, had it not been that I staid to enjoy the sweet company of Frony Sykes. Just then the long &quot;ruffian&quot; in the cow-hide boots came and asked me, &quot;can’t yer play ther fiddle?&quot; I told him I could, a little, but would rather not, as I was just going up to bed; but turning round, he roared out, &quot;I say thar, Jim Beekers! jest bring yer fiddle here, quick.&quot; I would have left, but half a dozen of them surrounded me and couldn't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. I must play them &quot;Rake her down Sal,&quot; &quot;Gal on the log,&quot; or some other good &quot;chune&quot; anyhow. I took the fiddle, rosined the bow with a scientific flourish, drew it across the strings in a knowing manner, and struck up &quot;The Arkansas Traveller.&quot;</p><p>The ruffian gave a whoop and a spring into the air, cracking his cowhides together three times before he struck the floor. He seized Frony Sykes most earnestly by the hand, saying: - &quot;Get up here Frony, yer <em>must </em>dance <em>now.&quot; </em>- “If yer can't trot, yer can <em>pace.&quot; </em>&quot;Come along gal,&quot; and as he hurried her past me, she gave me a look from her big black eyes, expressive of unalterable affection. </p><p>Dancing seemed about to run mad. Such a clattering of heavy boots and thumping of big feet is rarely heard. They were dancing that &quot;reel.&quot; They were arrayed as for a &quot;contra dance,&quot; and the performance was in this order: All hands &quot;hoe down.&quot; First gentleman balance to second lady. First lady balance to second gentleman. Hoe down all. Cast off and right and left, and all hands &quot;hoe down&quot; again. </p><p>Loudly rang the violin - The &quot;Arkansas Traveller,&quot; - that remarkable old tune, better known in the Western States than ever was &quot;Old Hundred&quot; - just suited them. The cow-hide ruffian was &quot;spreading himself&quot; and his boots could be heard above all the rest, while an occasional whoop expressed his unmitigated delight. Frony Sykes was doing the best she knew how, very red in the face, and puffing with the exertion. I forgot her beautiful eyes as I contemplated the clumsy movements of her uncomely great feet. They all grew more and more excited, until at length they made such a furious noise that I could hardly hear the fiddle myself, when I very quietly laid the instrument down into the chair and in a trice was off out the back door and up stairs to the sleeping room, where I dodged into a bed in the corner. I was not more than stowed away, before I heard the whole tribe of &quot;border ruffians&quot; out in pursuit of me, whooping and yelling like so many wild Indians. I heard them searching round the barn, and soon a detachment, headed by the cow-hide boots and a lantern, came up stairs. Some of them were about to overhaul me when cow-hide told them, &quot;He isn't thar, that's Buck Simpson.&quot; </p><p>There were several travellers asleep in the beds, and some of them swore terribly at being disturbed by the cow-hide party. They searched in several places, but not finding me, they went down again, leaving &quot;Buck Simpson&quot; to enjoy a few hours repose. As I went to sleep, I heard the old fiddle scraping away again, with the accompanying clatter and thumping of big feet and boots.

Of late years the sale of liquor has been somewhat regulated by licensing, but not restricted so but that it can still be bought anywhere, in any quality, from a barrel down to a spoonful. The spacious and elegant first-class saloons, the hotel bar-rooms, and the one horse groggeries daily serve out their various and fancifully compounded drinks, to their thousands of thirsty customers, who generally seem to be impressed with the idea that punches, cocktails, toddies, and cobblers, are indispensibly necessary to the well being of the human constitution in California. Many drink because it is fashionable, others drink to be &quot;sociable,&quot; many drink from habit, but the vast majority probably drink liquor because they are fond of it. </p><p>Where intoxicating liquor is so plenty as it is here, it may be expected to be cheap, and it is cheap. Brandy can be bought all the way from a dollar to eight dollars per gallon, but the cheapest brandy, may be reasonably supposed to be a vile article. It is made of &quot;rot-gut&quot; whiskey and drugs and never saw so much as the skin of a grape, although barrels of it may often be seen with &quot;Old Cognac,&quot; &quot;Bordeaux,&quot; &amp;c innocently branded across the head - an ingenious fable, calculated to delude the unsophisticated. First rate brandy, imported from France, commands the best price of course, but a very good imitation of French Cognac is manufactured at the distilleries and sold at the same price as the imported article thus clearing an immense profit. </p><p>Around San Francisco there are several distilleries, where all kinds of liquors are manufactured by the wholesale, and from these distilleries goes forth the drugged alcoholic poison, to the California world, a messenger of evil, and a curse to all who drink of the fiery, inebriating draught. Up the rivers it is shipped to the interior cities, and into the mines. Into the remotest ravines of the Sierra Nevada the curse penetrates. The miner in his house of logs, sees and feels its influence, and alas, many are they who thus seeing and feeling yet blindly close their eyes, and yield their very souls into the power of the friend of intemperance. I never could look at one of those distilleries with tall chimney and clouds of black smoke, without being impressed with the idea that they were so many temples dedicated to the worship of the Devil and the smoke was but clouds of incense burned in his service. </p><p>In all the cities exists the system of &quot;free lunches.&quot; All the principal groggeries every day about noon have side tables, with cooked meats, bread, cheese, and other eatables, arranged thereon, where the patrons of the bar, can partake of a lunch, without paying, except for the liquor they drink. Everyone, however, is expected to eat nothing more than a &quot;lunch,&quot; although it is notoriously a fact that there are many of the city &quot;loaferati&quot; who always depend on the free lunches for their dinner, and these are they who paying 12 1/2 cents for a glass of liquor, will contrive to gormandize enough of the lunch to constitute a hearty meal, that would cost them at least half a dollar had they been obliged to get it at a restaurant. </p><p>The old topers too, all are in favor of the free lunch system, for instead of paying four &quot;bits&quot; at a restaurant for their dinner, they can go into one of these groggeries, and get not only a dinner for the same money, but four &quot;drinks&quot; besides; so with them the free lunch is a decidedly fine institution. Some of the saloons charge two bits a drink, and set as fine a table as can be found at any hotel in the city. </p><p>The influences which tend to induce men to use spirituous liquors as a beverage are many, and comparatively few are they who at home stood firm in their opposition to anything intoxicating, who do not gradually change in their principles and yield to the influences which surround them here. It frequently happens that an individual meets a friend whom he has not seen before for years, and on such an occasion their foot steps seem naturally to incline towards the nearest whiskey shop, where they may revive old scenes and recollections over a horn or so of the ardent. </p><p>Brown meets his friend in the street - &quot;Ah! how are you Sykes,&quot;&quot; Just in time old boy&quot; - &quot;never so dry in my life&quot; - &quot;system requires irrigation&quot; - &quot;let's step into &quot;Oakley's&quot; and have a cocktail&quot; - Sykes, always willing to take a drink with a friend, does not object, of course, merely stipulating perhaps that he shall have the pleasure of standing treat next time. Female society, and the pleasures of the home circle are more rare here, than at home, and of an evening, what is more natural than for a man to leave the bachelor retirement of the hotel or his rooms, and take a turn about the city, to see what is going on, and lunging into some one of the brilliantly lighted saloons which open wide their doors so invitingly, he strolls round to take a view of the many fine pictures which decorate the walls. Becoming thirsty at contemplating the bar &quot;fixins,&quot; and the numerous individuals slaking their thirst thereat, he also consoles and puts himself to rights with a small horn. If he should happen to meet some of his friends there, why, a drink all round is of course indispensably necessary. </p><p>In any of the saloons, a quiet corner, a snug table, and a pack of cards are to be found, and a party of friends sitting down to a pleasant little game of Euchre, generally agree that the one that gets beaten, must stand treat for all hands; this is &quot;playing for the drinks.&quot; The California public are a betting public, and &quot;the drinks&quot; are bet oftener than anything else. Individuals waxing warm in a friendly debate, are almost sure to &quot;bet the drinks&quot; that it &quot;is so,&quot; or &quot;not so,&quot; - the dispute ending in a drink. Mankind here seems prone to give way to the influences by which he is surrounded, but to sum up all, it amounts to merely a strong argument in favor of getting married. The society of woman, ever tends to the regulation and refinement of the habits of man, and without woman, society is indeed at loose ends. Surrounded by home comforts, and happy in the companionship of a good wife, a man has no call to seek pleasure abroad. In exact proportion as woman in her true sphere, has made her home in California, so has the society here become improved and purified.

Rock47,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLVII.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., April 18<sup>th</sup>, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: - In my last letter I spoke of the general predisposition of the California public generally, to use spirituous liquors as a common beverage, and showed forth some of the causes which induce many to partake of the intoxicating glass, and too often, to form a habit which may eventually lead them on, in that well-beaten downward path, which endeth in misery and ruin.</p><p>There are hundreds, yes, I might say thousands, in California, who are slaves to Alcohol, and who spend all their hard-earned wages for intoxicating drink. They will not, cannot, save up their earnings; but just allowing themselves the commonest necessaries of life, all beside is spent for liquor. In the mines, such is especially the case. There are plenty of miners who work hard and steadily all the week, and on Sunday, go on a &quot;bender.&quot; </p><p>On Spanish Gulsh, I knew one individual, a hard working, industrious man as I ever saw, who used to work steady as a mill during the week, but on Sunday he rarely failed to go to Mokelumne Hill - some six miles - on a spree. He always went to buy provisions for the coming week, and his mercantile negociations being concluded, he felt that a dram of whiskey was necessary to recuperate his system. Dram followed dram, in more and more rapid succession, until &quot;Grizzly Bill&quot; - as the boys used to call him, from the enormous quantity of beard on his face would become roaring drunk. Then was the time for the gamblers. Bill was always ready to try his luck at &quot;Monte,” and a very short time sufficed to fleece him of his last dollar. Then he would become belligerent and would go round begging some one to fight him. He never had to wait long, for Sunday is the miners day for &quot;going to town,&quot; and he generally found rough and ready ones enough. About sunset having regaled himself with all the fighting he wanted, and having invariably got whipped, he would be seen reeling off towards home, with his provisions on his back. He hardly ever reached home however, before next morning, but passed the night in the chapparal, about half way up some big hill. </p><p>Oftentimes, half a dozen or so of miners will rig up in their Sunday best, and &quot;go to town&quot; together. Arrived in town, of course some one stands treat, and they all have a drink together, and a cigar. To rest themselves after their walk perhaps a game of &quot;Euchre&quot; is found necessary; so sitting down round the table, in some store, they smoke their fragrant Havana's, and playa game or so, &quot;for the drinks.&quot; After a while they may consider a lunch necessary, so they play for sardines, oysters, or something of that sort, and a bottle or so of wine. Before evening, some of them will get somewhat &quot;tight,&quot; and all being more or less elated, have a jolly time on the road home. </p><p>Among the Spanish portion of the miners, too, the Sabbath is set aside, as a day of rest from all mining, and held sacred to the worship of Bacchus. On that holy day, the little Mexican villages swarm with the &quot;miners&quot; who come in from the surrounding diggings, each one dressed in a clean white, or calico shirt, and their peculiar style of dress pantaloons, open down the sides, showing their white under pants, and with a red sash about their waist. The &quot;Fondas,&quot; and the &quot;Cafes.&quot; of course are the principal points of attraction, and they do a good business in the liquor line. Along about 11 o'clock, the liquor begins to tell pretty strongly upon the heads of the drinkers, and the game of Monte is well patronized by the reckless subjects of the bottle. </p><p>A guitar, strumming about that time, has plenty of dancers to keep pace with the music, and the &quot;Sambo quaker&quot; is kept up with great spirit. The principal Cafe generally employs a harp, and violin on the occasion, which adds materially to its attractions. Along in the afternoon they get about drunk enough to sing, or rather we may say they get howling drunk. Knots of three or four or half a dozen of them, get together and standing in a circle, holding on to each other, they do set up some of the most doleful kind of howling, imagining themselves to be singing sentimental airs. I well recollect of one old grey-bearded greaser, that I saw singing thus, who was so completely carried away by the sentiments of the song, that he stood grasping one of his companions by the elbow, and madly gesticulating with the other hand while the big tears rolled down his dirty cheeks. Now he <em>was </em>a comical sight. Mexican singing I never considered to be of the first quality of vocal music, and under the circumstances which I have related, one should hear it, and view the performers, to appreciate it good. </p><p>Many there are in California, who at home stood high in the estimation of their friends, temperate, upright, and industrious, yet here in California, have been led step by step, to stray into the paths of the tempter, until at last yielding to the power of the Alcoholic Demon, ruin, despair, and death followed, and they now fill a drunkard’s grave. I have seen friends, who, when sober, were like brothers, by the cursed glass gradually alienated from each other, until their friendship terminating in some drunken brawl, they became deadly enemies. </p><p>There were those whom I loved as friends; there were those, whose only fault, I deemed to be an over-fondness for the inebriating draught. My heart bled as I saw them in the power of the Demon, and I earnestly prayed them to burst the bonds which held them; to dash aside the sparkling poison, and assert their manhood once more; but alas, the fascinations of the tempter closed their ears to friendly counsel, and blindly, recklessly, they followed the drunkard’s path, hurrying on to the drunkard's doom. - There were those too who reformed, and rising from the depths of their degradation, became once more men; and now, abstaining from all that will intoxicate, defy the power, which once held them in bondage. </p><p>Where is he, who before the blazing log fire, in the comfortable cabin, could always draw a circle of eager listeners to his well told tales of history or romance? Where is he, whose comic songs and witty sayings enlivened the long winter evenings? Where is the rough-moulded, yet good humored one, ever unmindful of his own interests in his regard for the interests of his friends, and who was so ever ready to drop pick and shovel, and take up the quarrel of his friends; aye, and fight for them too, if he thought necessary? Where are they? - On the green banks of the Calaveras, and near the turbid waters of the Mokelumne they sleep their last sleep. Untimely was their death; hastened by the cursed liquid poison; but – </p><p>&quot;They were miners; let their faults, <br />Be buried in their tomb.&quot; </p><p>There are hundreds of those condemned by the power of Alcohol, to work in the mines, and there finish their miserable existence. They may dream of home and friends, but they will never leave the mines. </p><p>I have drawn no fancy picture, but one from real life. My own eyes have seen it. It is true. I have spoken of the past; but what of the future? Is California always to groan under the curse? Let us trust in God that she may not. </p><p>The people of California have too enlarged and extensive ideas of freedom, ever to submit to the tyranny of the prohibitory liquor law, but are there not many ways to win the misguided ones back to the path of rectitude? The cause of temperance has been steadily progressing of late years, until now in all the cities and towns, societies are formed, and the Order of the Sons of Temperance exists in full organization, reclaiming many from the error of their ways. Woman too making her home here, is exerting her most powerful influence towards the reclamation and regeneration of society. With those efforts, and influences, may we not hope for a brighter future for California? We may. </p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rock47.jpg
Rock48,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLVIII.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., May 3d, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -- </p><p>In former years, before the great gold discovery had called the attention of people of all nations, and induced them to flock from all quarters of the globe, to this land of deferred hope and golden promise, California was known and read of as a province of Mexico, whose people were of the Spanish race, and the language of the country was Spanish. </p><p>Foreigners, residents here, learned and adopted the language, and even the Indians acquired the knowledge and use of it, with facility. </p><p>But the new era has since dawned. No longer under Spanish rule, but one of the United States, California is filled with an enterprising Yankee population, and the English tongue supplants the Spanish. The native Californians all endeavor to learn to speak English, and in the mines, the Indians, many of them, speak the language quite fluently. Indeed, I have noticed that a Digger Indian, although he may not be able to speak more than a dozen words of English, will yet speak those correctly, and plainly, and they seem not to be troubled with a foreign accent, as are the Germans, or the French. </p><p>On the other hand, too, the Americans are generally desirous of learning to speak Spanish. A knowledge of the language often comes very convenient in dealing with the natives, and it is also cultivated by many, as an accomplishment. In San Francisco and other cities, Spanish is taught by masters of the language, and many, even of the most fashionable ladies and gentlemen, take private lessons in Spanish. As a matter of course, although many learn to talk it fluently, yet their number is small, compared with those whose knowledge of the language is confined to a few words and phrases. There are many too, who imagine themselves to be good at speaking Spanish, when in fact, they mangle, and pervert the language terribly. </p><p>Of this latter class was one Jeff Pelton, an individual I used to know on the Calaveras. He was fond of &quot;showing off&quot; his knowledge of the Spanish language, and tried to make those who knew no better, suppose that he spoke it equal to a native; but, in speaking the Spanish, being often at a loss for a word or so, he somehow contrived to get in numerous words of English, which had the effect, quite often, of completely mystifying the individual addressed. </p><p>A friend of his, being desirous of removing to &quot;Angel's Camp&quot; - some thirty miles - wished to employ an old Mexican who lived just below, on the river, and owned several pack mules, to pack all his furniture, mining tools, &amp;c. at once to that locality, but not understanding a word of Spanish, he got &quot;Jeff&quot; to act as interpreter on the occasion. </p><p>They went to see the Mexican, and Jeff, stepping forward and putting on as Spanish an air and expression as possible, commenced negociations. by saying: <em>&quot;este hombre quiere </em>(this man wishes to) hire <em>dos </em>(two) of your <em>mulas </em>(mules) to <em>vamose </em>his things up to Angel's Campo, <em>manana&quot; </em>(to-morrow.) <em>&quot;No entende,&quot; </em>replied the puzzled Mexican. &quot;He says he'll tend to it right away,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;All right Jeff, now ask him if he can't pack up, and start out early in the morning.&quot; Jeff interpreted it: <em>&quot;Mira hombre </em>(look here sir) can't you <em>vamose con </em>(with) the mules, <em>manana temporana?&quot; </em>(early tomorrow morning.) <em>&quot;No entende, senor,&quot; </em>(I do not understand you sir) replied the poor old Greaser, now more mystified than ever. <em>&quot;Not in ten days!&quot; </em>said Jeff; &quot;That won't do Jim, you want a faster team than his.&quot; &quot;Certainly I do,&quot; says Jim, &quot;but Jeff, I swar I'd give fifty dollars if I could only talk Spanish like you kin.&quot; </p><p>An anecdote is told of a fellow who was out hunting after a runaway horse, and meeting a Mexican on the road, he asked him: &quot;Have you seen anything of a bob-tailed <em>caballo </em>(horse) vamosing up <em>este camino </em>(this road) without any <em>hombre </em>(man) on his back?&quot; <em>&quot;No entende senor,&quot; </em>replied the Mexican, shaking his head. - &quot;Well, well,&quot; said our horse-hunter, turning away: &quot;you <em>must </em>be a cussed fool, if you can't understand yer own language.&quot; </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rock48.jpg
Rock49,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. XLIX.<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., May 19<sup>th</sup>, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -- </p><p>Rich as is California in her mineral wealth, rich as she is in her agricultural wealth, and numerous as are the roads to wealth and competence which she opens out to seekers after fortunes, yet among the busy throng of her varied population, are often seen objects of charity, and those who go about begging for money, or for bread. Poverty is seen abroad among the people, and in the midst of the mansions of the wealthy, stand the dwellings of the poor and needy. Wealth and poverty, are the daily companions of each other. </p><p>Many of those who arrive here, have expended their last dollar, in paying the expense of the long passage, and perhaps not being able to find employment at once on their arrival, become reduced to the necessity of even begging, for their food. Many too, are brought to want, by sickness, consequent upon their arrival in a new country, and the change of climate, as well as the effects of the long sea voyage. </p><p>Quite often, one meets with an object of charity, in the shape of a miner, who has got injured and disabled by some mining accident. The caving of a bank, or a tunnel, or the falling of a rock, may in one moment crush and maim for life, even the strongest; and he whose stout heart beats high with golden hopes of fortune, in an instant lies crushed and bleeding; his strong limbs broken and crippled; doomed ever after to control the proud spirit within him, and meekly bow his head as he asks charity of the cold, unfeeling world; bitterly feeling, perhaps, that it were better that he too, had shared the fate of his companions, who were killed by his side, and that he had not been spared to be a beggar asking for alms. </p><p>There are many who go about begging because they are in reality too lazy to work, and indeed find it more profitable. </p><p>Vesuvius, that miraculous volcano, whose flowing rivers of fire have destroyed the vineyards and houses of the surrounding country, times without number, and caused the poor inhabitants to emigrate to foreign countries in quest of funds to assist in replacing those fair vineyards and vine-clad cottages, is still at its devastating work, and poverty stricken Italians perambulate the streets of San Francisco, as I used to remember them in Old Plymouth, with mournful cast of physiognomy, presenting a folded document of dirty paper, whose written contents were to the effect that Signor Humbugazzi - the bearer of said document - by a destructive and unfortunate &quot;eruption of Vesuvius,&quot; had been despoiled of his home, vineyard , fig-tree, &amp;c., and was now on his mission among a charitable, generous public, endeavoring to collect funds enough to assist him in replacing what was lost; the contents of the document winding up with the information that the bearer thereof - he of the pitiful countenance - &quot;cannot speak a word of English.&quot; Remorseless Vesuvius. They should locate their ranches at a more eligible distance from that fiery mountain. </p><p>Mauna Loa, a rascally volcano in the Sandwich Islands, has also, like Vesuvius, been devastating the surrounding vicinity, and caused several of the Kanaka population to emigrate to California's charitable shores. </p><p>When I was residing at Mission Dolores, there one day came an old Kanaka to the house begging. He was a short, black, dirty, little blear-eyed old man, and about as ugly looking a specimen of humanity, as one could wish to see. He looked at me earnestly in the face, and puckering up his mouth in a highly peculiar manner, said: - &quot;Hungly me - me poor - belly hungly.&quot; We gave him some bread and meat, which he received very thankfully, saying: - &quot;Belly good - tankee you.&quot; After carefully stowing the food away in a big haversack, which he carried under his arm for the purpose, he said: - &quot;Me likee monay - big bolcano burnee me house – you gibbee me monay.&quot; He came once or twice afterwards but finding &quot;money&quot; scarcer than cold victuals, he discontinued his visits. </p><p>Some two years ago, myself and a friend were riding over the Atlanta road, between Santa Clara and San Jose, when we were accosted by a strong hearty looking native Californian, with: - <em>&quot;buenos dias caballeros&quot; </em>(good day gentlemen) <em>&quot;Da one un rial por el amar de Dios.&quot; </em>- (Give me a 'bit,' for the love of God.) <em>&quot;Yo quiere compra pan&quot; </em>(I want to buy bread.) He said he was poor and destitute; but being such a stout built old fellow, I asked him if he could not get employment in some one of the neighboring ranches, as it was now harvest, and plenty to do, but he replied: - <em>&quot;Si senor; pero no me gusta a trabaio&quot; </em>(Yes sir, but I do not like to work.) We have him a &quot;quarter&quot; upon which he rolled up the whites of his eyes, and extending his hands towards Heaven fervently, exclaimed <em>&quot;Dios le paga!&quot; </em>(God will repay you.) We rode off. </p><p>The Indians are the greatest beggars in the country. In the mining region they are most numerous and especially troublesome. Being naturally of an indolent disposition, they avoid work, and if they can get enough to eat by begging, they had much rather do so. Feed an Indian once, and he is sure to call again next day. Feed him again, and he will bring his squaws with him, next time he comes, and perhaps a few of his personal friends. The first thing the Indian asks for is bread. Give him bread, he will ask for sugar to eat with it; then for some coffee; then for more bread; and more sugar or butter. His appetite partially satiated, he will ask for a shirt, hat, a pair of pants, a coat, or anything else that he may see that you have, and he stands in need of, having no delicate scruples whatever, in regard to asking for anything. </p><p>I have seen beggars of all nations, and shades of color, except Chinese. I never yet have seen a Chinese beggar. Whether they are more industrious, and take better care of each other, than do people of other nations, or not, I cannot say, but certain it is, that although the Chinese comprise a goodly proportion of the population of this State, yet a Celestial beggar is not to be seen.

Rock50,"<p>From our California Correspondent.<br />No. L. <br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co., <br />Cal., June 4<sup>th</sup>, 1857.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Harvest is now with us fast commencing, and throughout the state, the waving grain is fast falling before the steel of the reaper. The barley and oat crops ripen first, and as yet, no wheat has been harvested. New barley, even now, is in market for sale, but it does not command as good a price as old barley, as it weighs heavier, and is not so good for animals, or for brewing purposes. </p><p>In March, we had heavy rains, and most of the farmers, anticipating good crops in consequence, sowed any quantity of grain; but a long drought followed the rains, and the late sown crops all proved a failure, for we have had little or no rain since then, and it is too late in the season now to look for anything but dry weather. But the grain crops, such as they are, afford at the present time plenty of work and good wages; so everything in the farming sections are busy. The ambitious &quot;down-easter,&quot; the chivalric Southerner, the tall men from &quot;Pike,&quot; and even the Mexicans and Indians find plenty of employment at good wages. </p><p>Speaking of tall men, reminds me of one of those little incidents of the &quot;olden time,&quot; which one sometimes recalls to mind. One of the landmarks along the shores of memory; reminding me of the days long ago, when the Pilgrim Mining Company were in existence, flourishing, and in full operation. </p><p>It was in December, '49. We had got short of provisions at our camp at Wood's diggings, and having no bread to eat, a large party of us, consisting of the worthy President of the P. M. Co., the secretary, directors &amp;c - eighteen of us in all - started, and went down some twenty-one miles below Woods', to where a large box of pilot bread belonging to us had been left on the road, by a teamster; the road being so bad that he could get no farther with it. We filled several sacks with the bread, and each one taking his load, started off on the return. </p><p>We did some pretty smart travelling, and got back as far as Green Springs - ten miles from Woods' - at dark. Here we stopped for the night. We partook of a most bountiful supper of venison steaks, but the night being frosty, and having no blankets, we built a large fire, and passed the night as best we could. Just after dark, Mr. W. H. Stewart, member of the State assembly, arrived with two of his friends, and also put up for the night. He was a jolly good-natured fellow, and not being able to procure grain here, he bought eleven pounds of bread of us for his horse, paying us <em>a dollar and a half a pound for it. </em>Pretty expensive feeding, I thought.</p><p>Stewart's friends were tall men, and one of them whom he called Caleb, was especially tall. He was considerably over six feet in height, and the tallest man in the company. Our landlord Mr. Tanner - too was a tall man, and he and Stewart kept up a continual running fire of jokes and conversation in regard to tall men, and short men. Stewart would have them stand back to back, and Caleb was decided to be the tallest of the two. He then bet a treat for the whole company, that Caleb was the tallest man within two miles. </p><p>The landlord immediately accepted the bet, and turning round, called to his cook, who was in the back part of the house, saying &quot;Come out here Jim, here's a man that thinks he's taller than you.&quot; In a minute or so, out carne Jim. Now he <em>was </em>a tall man. He had to stoop considerably in coming in at the door. As he entered, Caleb fell on his knees before him, in perfect diminution of spirit, while Stewart roared out, &quot;There! there! that'll do; you needn't straighten up, that's enough of you; co,e up here, all hands, it's my treat.&quot; The tall giant looked disdainfully down upon poor humble Caleb, remarking: &quot;Well, well, so yer thought yer was torl did yer? Why, stranger yer aint nowhar. I kin just <em>stand flat foot, and lick salt off the top of the head of any man in Californy:&quot; </em>And I believe he could; easy. </p><p>The wheel of time whirls swiftly round, and the Pilgrim Mining Company, with its president, secretary, treasurer, directors and other officials, are remembered among the things of the past. And those who were members of that remarkable organization, cannot but cherish a kindly remembrance of the good old bark Yeoman, and speak well of the staunch ship that bore us safely past the perils of the &quot;gulf-stream,&quot; the &quot;River of Plate,&quot; and the immortal &quot;Horn,&quot; o'er the blue Pacific, safe to the land of golden hopes, and much promise. </p><p>Many of the company that sailed in the old Yeoman, have returned to the dear home of their birth, but many still linger here, toiling for that for which they carne; wealth and competence. Do not their hearts yearn towards dear old Plymouth? Do not they in their nightly slumbers dream of &quot;the loved ones at home,&quot; the &quot;friends of long ago?&quot; Happy visions of their childhood home, father, mother, and those so near and dear to their memory, sweetly visit them in their sleep, and although California blooms with flowers, and teams with precious gold, yet &quot;Horne sweet home,&quot; is not here. </p><p>Who shall describe the heart-yearnings towards home and friends, the heart-sinkings of disappointed expectations; the joyous step, and the beating heart of the successful one &quot;homeward-bound.&quot; Who may describe the flush of joy at receiving the &quot;letter from home?&quot; The trembling of the hand as it tears the sealed envelope; the beaming eye, filled with hope and fear as it greedily scans the contents? </p><p>Dear Rock: With this letter, let us draw our series of correspondence to a close. It is just three years to-day since the series commenced, and I have often thought of late, that it would perhaps be better to leave the columns of the Rock to be embellished by abler pens than mine, and you, or at least your readers, may be getting desirous of a change. If anyone of my stray sketches and remarks, have pleased you at any time, or if you have ever been more amused in the reading than I have in the writing, I am truly glad.

A rival El Dorado has been discovered in the cold regions of the northern hemisphere. The bed of Frazer river, away up in the British Possessions, is reputed to be teeming with the yellow gold. Only some three or four months ago the news came. It was not whispered about among a few, but at once appeared in all the daily papers, to feast the eyes of numerous implicit believers. All the old steamers were at once hauled in alongside the wharves, and placards round the streets, and advertisements announced to the gaping public, that the &quot;splendid and commodious steamship So-and-so, would take her place in the regular line to sail direct for the newly discovered gold mines on Frazer river. For freight or passage, apply on board.&quot; </p><p>The travelling, enterprising public were already packing up, and away steamed the old coffin hulks, loaded to the guards with freight, and crowded with passengers, cheering as they left, in answer to the loud huzzas of the crowds on the wharves. No one seemed to &quot;care a cuss&quot; how they got to &quot;Frazer,&quot; so long as they got there. But some of the old steamers returned, disabled after a short absence. The passengers however, just philosophically got aboard of some of the other Frazer &quot;packets,&quot; and took a fresh start. Miraculous good luck seemed to attend emigrants to the new gold region, for but few lives were lost.</p><p>All was bustle and excitement throughout the state. The miners packed up, left their houses of logs, and down the river they came, to San Francisco, en route for the &quot;new diggings.&quot; - Farmers, merchants, mechanics, and many families, joined in the rush; pretty nearly everybody became more or less touched with the “Frazer fever.&quot; Even Mr. Bolt began to covet the piles of treasure, that they told him constituted the bed of the immortal &quot;Frazer,” in the realms of the British Lion; but like many others, he couldn't go there, because of his crop of grain, which he must needs stay and harvest. Many an old familiar face disappeared under the prevailing epidemic, and in a short time, it was estimated that over thirty thousand had left California. </p><p>Soon, very soon, there came rather discouraging accounts from those who had gone first. The river was too high &amp;c. That, however, was nothing new, for with the very first news of the gold discovery, the river was stated to be &quot;too high,” and no gold of any consequence was to be found, except in the bed of the stream, and the overflowed bars. And no one had got a sight at the gold, except a few favored ones, who were just permitted to get a look at the precious metal, when the swollen torrents, from the melting snows on the mountains, caused the river to rise, and overflow all chance at the fabulously immense riches which were now just known to exist there. &quot;Gold Lake,” &quot;Gold Bluff,” “Kern river,&quot; and all the other gold excitements and humbugs, that led people so wildly astray in times past, faded into insignificance beside this golden dream. </p><p>The first emigrants wrote back to their friends not to come, stating their realization of represented difficulties, &amp;c., but still the rush continued. All wanted to be there, on hand for the first chances. Victoria, on Vancouver’s Island, and Whatcom, a new city sprung up on Bellingham Bay, were the two neighboring points to the golden river, and thither congregated the adventurous multitudes. Thousands had just enough to pay their passage, and landed destitute, in a strange, unsettled country, were they could get no means of earning even their necessary food. They were still many rough and rugged miles from the golden treasure for which they came, and the aforesaid treasure was decidedly not to be got at. Thousands of them encamped round the shores of Bellingham Bay, subsisting on muscles, clams, &amp;c., each one &quot;staking off his claim,&quot; of a specified number of square yards, or rods, of shellfish. Quite a jolly idea, too. Just imagine the hungry miner, waiting for the tide to fall, so that he could get at his &quot;regular grub.&quot; Imagine also, the happiness of the &quot;clams at high water.&quot;</p><p>Oh, but it brings to my mind those well remembered Saturday afternoons, when with one or two of my chosen schoolmates, I used to so enjoy a &quot;clam-bake,&quot; or a kettle of boiled clams, on the shore of Old Plymouth harbor. A few potatoes also, boiled with the clams, used to taste so nice to us, although I am sure I never used to like them at the dinner table. </p><p>And then if we could only steal a boat and scull round the wharves awhile, that completed our happiness. Recollections of the happy days when &quot;we children used to swim,&quot; has however no connection with the Frazer river subject. </p><p>The excitement has probably died away. Many have returned, most heartily glad to get home to California once more, but there are still a few going, and plenty of freight of all kinds leaves for Victoria and Whatcom. Now whether this great discovery of gold in the British Possessions will all turn out to be a grand humbug or not, we shall soon know. It is certain that gold is there, but how much, is the question. - The renowned river is said to be falling fast, and the cold weather will soon freeze the mountain snows and torrents, so that for a few months the river will be at its lowest stage. A good trail has at last been discovered, and opened through the otherwise impassable mountains, by which the mines are comparatively easy of access, and the dangers of the passage up the rapid river in canoes, and the consequent loss of life and property avoided. Gold has also been discovered on Thompson river, and other tributaries of Frazer river. </p><p>I read a letter from an old acquaintance of mine yesterday. It was dated the 5th of this month. He was on board the old steamer “Sea Bird&quot; of San Francisco, hard and fast aground on Frazer river just below Fort Hope. He was getting eighteen dollars per day, helping to get the steamer off. </p><p>He says the river is falling fast, and people are hurrying up to the mines. Victoria and Whatcom would soon be deserted by their floating population. He thinks now is the time to go to the mines, and he fully believes he can do better in that country than he ever could in California. He writes in the same cheerful, hopeful strain as used to characterize many of the letters from California in the early days. I hope for his sake as well as for the sake of many other friends who have gone thither, that they may fully realize their golden anticipations. Time will show. </p><p>Meanwhile, the gold mines in this state have not given out. They are in fact inexhaustible, at least for a hundred years. &quot;New diggings&quot; are of frequent discovery, and many secret stores of the precious metal still remain to be prizes to the persevering. </p><p>But, none but strong, able bodied men can expect any success in the mines, for the gold has to be sought now deep in the bowels of the earth, my means of long tunnels and deep shafts. The surface diggings still continue to pay, but it takes good experienced miners, together with all the most modern improvements, and implements, which, by dint of perseverance, and strong arms, make the old surface diggings still pay to work over.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns01.jpg
Rockns02,"<p>No. 2<br />Mountain View, Santa Clara Co, Cal, Sept 1858</p><p>Dear friend Rock</p><p>The dusty, sweating, weary toil of harvest being over, and a good opportunity presenting itself to me for a pleasant cruise about the country for a week or so, I accepted the kind invitation of my valued friend Fred. W. Lucas - who had come to pay me a visit - accompanied by a friend of his - and a fine morning, bright and early saw three of us tightly wedged into a borrowed buggy, propelled by a stout ambitious horse - also borrowed - Having but just returned with the pleasing incidents of my visit still fresh on my mind, perhaps a light sketch of it may not be amiss.</p><p>We had twenty miles to go but the road was good and our gallant steed I took us along at a rattling pace - We passed through the town of Alviso at the head of the Bay, and were soon among the broad rich acres of Alameda county. The crops were mostly gathered in, but we passed many fields of grain that were just being harvested. At one place we stopped to see a &quot;clipper,&quot; or &quot;header” at work. This ma.hine cuts a swarth ten feet in width, but only clips off the heads of the grain, leaving the straw standing. From the cutting knives the grain passed on a broad, leather belt up a wide spout and over into a big square box which is drawn by the side of the machine for the purpose. It took four horses to propel the machine, and one man drove steers and managed the whole concern. As fast as the box became full, it was driven off, and another one took its place. The threshing machine - a ten horse Pitts separator - stood at a convenient point in the field, and the boxes - of which there were three drawn by two horses - unloaded directly into it. By this method of operating, from twenty to thirty acres or more are harvested in a day. </p><p>Our road wound round through the broad side farming lands that skirt the shores of San Francisco Bay, and noon found us at the old Mission of San Jose, where we stopped, had our brave old horse regaled with a feed of good barley and hay, and after partaking of a substantial meal of corned beef, cheese, pie and water, at a hotel, we took a survey of the place-</p><p>The Mission of San Jose is very prettily located upon a rising ground among the low hills at the foot of the big mountains of the Contra Costa range, and contains some fifty houses, built mostly in the old Spanish style with adobe walls, and red tiled roofs. The broad street, running through the town, with the whitewashed houses on each side presented quite a refreshing air of neatness for a Spanish town, this is probably owing mostly to the presence of the Anglo Saxon race, with the march of improvement. Many of the old residents still remain here, but the enterprise and business elements of the place, are American ­ This Mission was founded by the Jesuits, in 1797, and their massive old church, the largest building in the town still opens its portals as of old, to the religious Catholic masses, or to the repentant miner seeking the consolation of the confessional - Just back of the church, is the old Mission orchard, and it being the season for ripe fruit, we entered, and made purchase of a sufficiency of peaches, pears &amp;c to satisfy our appetite in that line - All kinds of fruit trees were there, even to figs and olives, and being situated on a fine slope, the whole orchard and vineyards are irrigated by a stream coming down from the mountain ravines - There are other fine orchards and vineyards about here, but we did not find time to visit them. </p><p>We harnessed up our faithful horse-flesh, ourselves into that contracted buggy, and moved on. In about two miles we came to where there was a large &quot;harvester&quot; at work, so we got out to see it, as it is something new here in California. There are but two of them as yet in this valley at work. They cut, thresh, clean and sack up the grain, ready for market, leaving the crop all sacked up, standing round the field. It is simply a reaper and thresher combined. Mr. Strong, the proprietor of the machine, built it himself, in San Francisco &amp; and he explained to us the working of it. We also each of us took a turn at riding on the machine as it went round the field, to observe the working of the various parts. We were very much pleased with it, and believe that with some few little improvements it must supersede in a great measure, all other modes of harvesting. It takes two horses to haul it, two drivers, one man to regulate the height of the knives in cutting, be means of a regulating wheel for that purpose, and one man to tend to the sacking department. They can harvest barley at the rate of nearly two bushels per minute. </p><p>Nothing more of note interrupted our progress, and at 4 o'clock PM, we arrived at our place of destination, near the little country town of Centreville, on the ranch of Don Augustin Aliviso, one of the old Spanish residents. The ranch rejoices in the name of &quot;Rancho do los Sierritos de Jesus Maria,&quot; and includes some three or four square leagues of fine farming &amp; grazing land. On a portion of this ranch my friend Lucas raised wheat and potatoes this year, and his crop of wheat turned off fifty bushels to the acre - a very heavy yield - You of course recollect Lucas as do most Plymouth boys. He has also a ranch in the mountains, a few miles from the Mission San Jose where he has a few hundred head of sheep, and some cattle, horses, &amp;c. </p><p>On another portion of the Alviso ranch, Mr. Jocelyn had a large crop of wheat, averaging sixty bushels to the acre. In fact all the land about there is excellent wheat land, and turns off heavy crops. Nathan Layell esq. - of the firm of Layell, Perkins, &amp;c, Bridgewater - has also a fine farm of two hundred acres, prettily located, in the vicinity. About two miles below, is Mayhew Landing, where all the farmers take their grain, for shipment to San Francisco. It is situated at the head of a slough, or creek of some five miles in length that makes its winding way through the broad salt marsh, into the Bay. Small sloops and schooners only can come up here, owing to the shallowness of the water. Capt Jonathan Mayhew - a Nantucket man, here does a brisk business in the freighting line. He has also large warehouses where he stores grain for the farmers, so that they can have it shipped to market whenever the price suits.</p><p>During the winter season the marshes and all the little creeks and inlets literally swarm with wild geese and ducks, affording a lucrative chance for shooting, for the city market. The Capt made fifteen hundred dollars winter before last, at that business. He understands the thing exactly, and of course knows when and where to go, to get the best shots - And then too he has the tools to do with. One large double barrelled gun which he has, is much the largest I ever saw. It is very heavy, and has such a tremendous bore, that it takes about a handful of shot to each charge. This weapon at seventy-five or a hundred yards is bound to kill, or cripple a very large number of fowls –</p><p>The notable shots that Capt Mayhew has made with shot gun are often spoken of, and to a novice would seem almost incredible. He once shot one hundred and forty two ducks at one shot of both barrels, and with a single barrel, he shot 104 and at another time 102 ducks. Pretty tall shooting, you think, well it was. One morning winter before last, as the sloop Hector, Capt Adoniram Bates, was leaving the landing, with freight for San Francisco, Capt Mayhew started out with his big gun, shot nine dozen ducks and geese, intercepted the sloop some two miles down the crooked slough, and put the game on board for the San Francisco market. Such luck as that for a mornings work is hard to beat; and such shooting is indeed slaughter most fowl. </p><p>Mr. Layell contributed much to the pleasure of my visit, by taking me around through the country in his buggy, the cares of business giving way to the rites of hospitality. Among other places that we visited, was the famous Warm Sulphur Springs situated a few miles south of the Mission in a romantic little valley, at the foot of the mountain. It is a favorite resort for invalids and pleasure seekers and here too, it is said that Major Gen Wook did some pretty responsible &quot;poker&quot; playing when in California. The principal building as a large two story house for the accommodation of the boards. Here, taking advantage of the fine bathing facilities, we enjoyed a luxurious bath in the warm sulphur water. Beautiful groves, walks and flower gardens surround the establishment and in the open space in front, a splendid fountain plays in a large circular basin of masonry. In the rear of the house and gushing directly from the base of the lofty mountain is the noted spring, the waters of which are about blood warm, and of a somewhat taste being highly impregnated with sulphur; a pipe from this spring supplies the fountain in front of the house. </p><p>Amid the pleasures of my visit a week whirled rapidly round, and brought me back to my old &quot;stamping ground” whence I write, but as this fills my sheet, I must bid you</p><p>Adios,</p><p>Ben Bolt</p>",public://rock/Rockns02.jpg
Rockns03,"<p>California Correspondence.</p><p>NEW SERIES. –No. III.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Nov. 18<sup>th</sup>, 1858.</p><p>“MOVING ON.”</p><p>DEAR FRIEND ROCK:--</p><p>I have missed writing to you the last three mails, owing to change of location and alteration of affairs generally, making it inconvenient to keep up my correspondence; for as you may perceive by the dating of my letter, I have once more received a call to &quot;move on,&quot; and in accordance therewith, I cast off from my old moorings near Mountain View, set sail, and have now dropped my “<em>keelick”</em> in a new berth. I am squatted on a little ranche of 160 acres, situated some four miles north of the city of San Jose. Milpitas is about 2 1-2 miles distant; but being the nearest post office, I date my letters from there. It is a small, country village, of two stores, post office, a blacksmith shop, two or three dwelling houses, a groggery, &amp;c. It is situated on the main stage rode from San Jose to Oakland, and receives its principal support from the surrounding farming community. </p><p>The country hereabouts, as is the misfortune generally of Santa Clara valley, is claimed under unsettled Spanish grants, deterring the actual settlers from making any very permanent improvements, as of course, no one wishes to go on and improve a farm on an uncertainty as to whether he can hold it, and not knowing how soon he may have to vacate the premises and lose all his improvements. These dubious Spanish grants, have been, and still remain, a very serious drawback on the prosperity of the country. </p><p>On the 21st and 22d of the last month, we had the first rains of the season. They fell unusually heavy for so early, and wet the dry, hard-baked surface of the valley, to the depth of three or four inches, almost deep enough for ploughing. Since then, we have had some fine warm weather, that has caused the young grass and weeds to spring up and start growing. Already the old brown parched hill-sides, are assuming a greenish tint, and although winter is soon with us, yet it could here with propriety be called spring: for with the first rains the green grass always starts up, and in December we can commence ploughing and putting in the grain crops. We generally have about three month's ploughing season. After February is rather late for sowing grain. Many farmers are even now busy sowing grain on the old ground that was ploughed and cropped last year. For this purpose, a new machine lately introduced into this state, is eminently adapted; and although new with us, it has been very successfully operated in the older states. It is &quot;Willard's Patent Seed-sower and Harrow.” It sows the grain, harrows it in, and a roller has been attached to it, so that it leaves the ground smooth and even, and in fine condition for a good crop. Two horses can haul it, but four can work it much easier, and one man driving with this machine can put in twelve or fifteen acres of wheat in a day. </p><p>Just below Milpitas, on the Oakland road, is a fine place for horse-racing, and for the last ten days there has been held a grand racing contest, mostly between the native Californians and the resident Chileans; although some few horses have been put into the lists by Americans and Irishmen. Some pretty tall running has been done, but the &quot;best horse&quot; is rather difficult to decide upon as yet, some talking largely about the &quot;black filly,'' others &quot;going their pile&quot; on the ''little gray horse,&quot; while the ''sorrel mustang,&quot; has also a host of friends. Several large tents and temporary saloons, with gay flags flying are on the ground, to give the fast multitude a fair show for spending their loose change for bad liquors, cooked food, fruit, or anything else they may wish. The racing will not be over for some days longer, probably, for the Spanish population take a strong interest in the subject, and large numbers of gay dashing &quot;<em>caballeros</em>,&quot; &quot;dark-eyed senoritas,&quot; &quot;rancheros,&quot; and &quot;greasers&quot; generally, congregate &quot;thar.”</p><p>Politics is at a discount. No one &quot;cares a cuss&quot; for it; but in the success of the Atlantic Telegraph, of course, will Californians take a lively interest. We look upon it as another step towards that which we so earnestly desire, the Pacific Railroad. Slowly but surely, step by step we are advancing in the development of that grand idea so long projected, but not rightly carried out. Already we have established an overland mail route, and Concord coaches, carrying passengers and Uncle Sam's mail, go dashing over the snowy heights of the Sierra Nevada, across the sandy deserts and plains, through the rocky mountain passes, which ere long must shout a welcoming echo to the joyous whistle of the rushing locomotive. </p><p>Perhaps ere the close of another year, the magic wire will be sending lightning messages across the big continent, and old ancient London will be holding close conversation with her infant sister San Francisco. A stage line now, a telegraph soon, and who shall say that the great Pacific Railroad shall not quickly follow? It must!</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns03.jpg
Rockns04,"<p>California Correspondence.</p><p>NEW SERIES. –No. IV.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Dec. 3d, 1858.</p><p>DEAR FRIEND ROCK:--</p><p>Since my last letter, things have wagged on about as usual, and with the exception of an unusual earthquake, nothing of much note has transpire. This notable convulsion of nature, came off on the night of the 25th ult., and although I have heretofore spoken of California earthquakes, as &quot;no great shakes,&quot; yet I can assure you this was not to be sneezed at, by any means. </p><p>It was just twenty minutes of one o'clock, and being somewhat unwell, I was sitting by my bed-side reading, when suddenly I was started to my feet by a heavy, dead concussion, as though a very heavy body of some hundred tons weight had fallen near the house, which was instantly followed by a violent quick shaking. I could hardly keep my feet. The timbers squeaked, the roof cracked, the doors and windows rattled furiously, the crockery and bottles on the shelf came down with a smash, the top of the chimney came crashing down upon the roof, and with an anxious regard for his devoted cranium, your honored correspondent made excellent time out through the back door. The shock only lasted, I should judge, about half a minute, and then all was still again as before. Two or three light shocks have been felt since then, but nothing worth while. </p><p>This shock was much more severely felt here, and within a few miles around, than it was elsewhere. At Santa Clara but little damage was done. At San Jose, one corner of a large concrete building in course of erection, was thrown down, and an old <em>adobe</em> house was also prostrated. Some few chimneys suffered, and many of the brick buildings were more or less cracked. A few bottles and other breakables, were also let down from shelves in bar-rooms and stores. Of course all the women were frightened. </p><p>In Rathbone's store at Milpitas, a whole long tier of shelves were nearly cleaned of a fine array of glass and crockery, and the next morning the proprietor had a fine mess to clean up, for the floor, back of the counter, was piled up with a rich mass of preserved fruits, pickles, candy, soap, mustard, brandy-peaches, pepper, tobacco, cheese, cigars, spices, essences, wines, and an endless variety of other little fixins, all in a state of conglomerated smash. The damage amounted to nearly or quite two hundred dollars. Creighton's store opposite, also suffered in the same manner to the extent of about twenty dollars. The chimneys of the blacksmith's shop were thrown down. </p><p>In San Francisco, it is usual created a great commotion in the Reassette House and other large hotels, and both women and men ran pell-mell from their rooms in their undergarments. Some day or other, a shock may come, strong enough to shake down these big five story brick buildings; a terrible loss of human life would be the result. </p><p>The Frazer river humbug has passed to be among the things that were, and of the many thousands that went thither, but few remain in that hard-favored region. All of my acquaintance who went have now returned, glad indeed to get back safe to this more genial clime, and most of them being in that embarrassing condition denominated &quot;flat broke,&quot; have to begin the world anew. The last one returned, an old mining acquaintance, relates a most doleful experience of those diggings. &quot;Thought the devilish river never <em>would</em> 'go down,’ and when it at last got as low as it ever will get, there wasn't any gold in it.” “A little in the bars, but a man couldn't make his salt there.&quot; “Went on a prospecting party way up a long ways above Fort Yale mountains, right up and down - awful rocks - no trail - no place for any - snow knee deep - half froze to death. Indians came upon them - robbed them - travelled three days with nothing to eat - got safe back to Fort Yale - sickness - starvation - mule meat and horse beef, great luxuries in that country - people selfish, <em>hogs </em>as a general thing - no protection for anything not English - no feeling for a human being,” &amp;c., &amp;c., and he winds up with cursing the Hudson's bay company and the whole British Possessions generally. From what accounts I can gather from those who have been there, the diggings are very limited in extent, comprising the distance between Fort Hope and Fort Yale, some fifteen or twenty miles. Hill's bar, Texas bar, Sailor's bar, and Emery's bar, seem to be the only localities where any gold has been found worth mentioning; and even on these bars, there were but few paying claims, and these were those that were the first found, and by means of which the whole excitement was got up. Victoria and Whatcom, those marvellous cities, that a few short months ago could count their population by tens of thousands, are now about deserted. They sprang up like mushrooms, they grew up like mushrooms, and now at last, they have dried up like mushrooms. </p><p>Last night the wind blew furiously all night, a regular hurricane from the northward. I think it must have done some damage about San Francisco. Several trees are blown down about here, and straw-piles and hay-stacks suffered considerably. It is much the hardest blow I have known of for these last three years. It has blown strongly most all day to-day, but moderated down at sunset to a decent breeze. It blew cold, and right from the tops of the Sierra Nevada, and ice formed last night three-eighths of an inch in thickness, the first I have seen this season. We rarely see it any thicker here, but I know old Plymouth ice can beat that some.</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns04.jpg
Rockns05,"<p>California Correspondence.</p><p>NEW SERIES – No. V.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Jan. 2d, 1859.</p><p>DEAR FRIEND ROCK:--</p><p>And once again, in accordance with the well-worn and time-honored custom at the commencement of each annual January, I am wishing you “a happy new year.&quot; I have often wondered how, or whence this custom first originated, or if it ever did originate or was always so. It is a custom that all youngsters, especially, fully believe in, and by them &quot;new year's day&quot; is considered an excellent institution as an annual source of revenue. Does Young America have any objections to &quot;new year's presents&quot;? None whatever. </p><p>On that memorable day he receives some of his earliest lessons in the art of acquiring coppers. To him those cabalistic words, &quot;wish happy new year,&quot; are looked upon as merely a verbal draft on certain pockets that he knows of, for any amount of money, from a cent to a &quot;fopunce,&quot; and the proprietors of those same pockets are generally &quot;spotted out&quot; for some days beforehand. He shrewdly feels it to be all important that no one should &quot;wish&quot; him first, therefore he keeps his young eye well &quot;peeled,&quot; and on the lookout for those from whom he expects coppers. A cent is established fee, two cents is highly gratifying, and a half dime is a &quot;rich strike.&quot; Don't anybody give him a &quot;ninepunce?” that would be rather too much for his young nerves. </p><p>Don't you remember when you and I were little boys, how on the last evening of the year, we used to lay awake in bed reckoning up the amount of money that we expected to receive for “wishing” on the morrow. &quot;Father would give us a cent,&quot; “so would mother;&quot; certain others of the family were duly considered, and next thing how should we spend our money? Ah now, that was not the least important point. Figs or dates were an excellent investment, also peanuts; and amid the perplexities of the question as to whether we should buy a cents worth of candy and two cents' worth of raisins, or two cents' worth of candy and one cent's worth of raisins, or spend the whole for &quot;liquorish ball,&quot; we fell asleep.</p><p>Since the great earthquake that l wrote of in my last letter, California has remained &quot;in status quo,&quot; although many timid ones predict that this last shake up is but a gentle foretaste of what is to come. They look anxiously forward to a grand burst-up and convulsion of nature, which shall tumble the mountains over into the plains, and leave the valleys bottom side up, and the rivers all running the wrong way. </p><p>And as an argument in support of such an uncomfortable state of things, is the fact that by the recent earthquake several large fissures or cracks were opened in the low grounds about San Jose, and hot vapors issue from them. In one of them about a week ago, the thermometer, at the depth of four or five feet, rose to 125 degrees Farenheit, the temperature of the air at the time being but 65 degrees. These cracks are quite a curiosity, and are visited by hundreds of anxious individuals. However, the old saying of “as long as she cracks she holds,&quot; must apply here. </p><p>We are now in the height of the ploughing season, and on every ranch the plow is fast turning up the mellow soil preparatory to another crop of the golden grain. I think there will be more sown this season than ever before. Thousands of acres of grain are already green and growing, and with plenty of rain, all things bid fair for a bountiful crop.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns05.jpg
Rockns06,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – No. VI.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Feb. 16th, 1859.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Just at the present time is the busiest part of the sowing season, and everybody is hard at work, early and late, plowing and &quot;putting in&quot; their crops. The season commenced with December, and many were sowing grain even before that; but with March the dry weather generally sets in, and grain sown then is rather late to produce a good crop, although it may in a favorable season do well. There will probably be more grain raised this year in California than ever before. Thus far the season has been favorable; the rains fell early, therefore plowing began early, and although the winter has been rather dry, yet during the past week copious rains have fallen every day and are still falling, giving the ground a better soaking than it had last winter. Everybody anticipates a most bountiful crop; may they not be disappointed. </p><p>I never saw what is termed a &quot;volunteer&quot; crop before I came to California, and perhaps you may not exactly understand what it is. As its name indicates, it is grain that grows voluntarily from seed that was scattered or wasted on the ground in the handling in harvest time. Thus, the same ground that I plow and sow this year will - seeded by the scatterings in harvest - produce a voluntary crop next year without giving me any more trouble than just to harvest it. Of course it will &quot;volunteer&quot; and keep on &quot;volunteering&quot; year after year; but after the first year, wild-oats, mustard, clover, and weeds get too much mixed in with it, and it pays best to plough and sow anew; although I helped to harvest a crop of barley, that was 'volunteered' <em>the third time</em>, and it yielded well; being the <em>fourth</em> crop from only one sowing. Such instances, however, are not very common. </p><p>&quot;Volunteering,&quot; is not peculiar to grain crops alone, for almost all vegetable grow in the same way here. Corn, beans, peas, tomatoes, and in short all seeds that drop upon the dry parched ground in the autumn remain perfectly sound and good until the winter rains come when they all vegetate. All the vegetable roots, such as potatoes, beets, carrots, turnips, &amp;c., are not killed by the winter, but on the contrary sprout out and grow again when winter comes. Cabbage, beets, cauliflower, &amp;c., are green the whole gear round. </p><p>Some very encouraging news has lately arrived from Frazer river, and some of those who went there and returned so disheartened are sorry that they were so much in a hurry to get back to California. Some even talk of returning thither to brave the ice and snows of the frozen Frazer region; entirely oblivious to the trials of their former experience of that inhospitable country in the recollection of certain flats and ravines, where they found a little gold, which are now magnified in their minds into rich diggins. </p><p>&quot;Sailor's ravine&quot; is now expected to have turned out very rich indeed; therefore, all who held claims there, and left for California, are sorry they didn't stay and &quot;prospect&quot; them more thoroughly. But they “always knew the gold was there&quot; though they &quot;didn't think it so very rich.” However, they will probably be rather more cautious about swallowing the golden news so greedily as formerly. </p><p>The land titles in this State still continue unsettled and even more complicated and entangled than ever. Frequent disputes arise, occasioned by conflicting claims to pieces of lands, and sometimes fighting or bloodshed is the result. A quarrel recently occurred near Mountain View, in which Paul Shores was shot dead, and his brother James was seriously cut with a bowie knife so that he was not expected to survive. They were building a house on a piece of land claimed by them, but which was also claimed by Thomas Beals, when Beals came with Crosby and Robb - two friends of his - and attempted to drive them off. In the affray which ensued, Beals shot Paul Shores, and Robb stabbed James Shores. The two brothers were orderly, respectable men, and stood high in the estimation of all who knew them, and the news of the fatal tragedy caused an immediate excitement throughout the whole neighborhood. Beals fled for his life to San Jose, where he gave himself up to the city authorities, and was immediately put in jail. He was quickly followed by a large body of the excited people and the fleetness of his horse alone saved him, for had he been taken he would have been hung to a branch of the nearest tree, as sure as fate. The sheriff at once placed a strong guard about the jail, and the military were assembled at their armory, but no attempt was made to force the prison. Crosby and Robb were both arrested by deputy sheriff Miller, who happened to be in the neighborhood at the time, and the murderers remain at present safely stowed away in jail.

Rockns07,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – No. VII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., April 3d, 1859.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -- This side of Uncle Sam's continent still continues to roll 'round with the balance of the world, and as it ever has been here in California, we rarely lack something to keep up the natural excitability of our excitable population. </p><p>Frazer River still continues to attract many of the floating classes of society, and late news from there, as usual, report still farther discoveries of the precious metal. No such &quot;rich strikes,&quot; however, are made there, as in our mines, and those icy regions cannot compare at the present time, with the glowing beauties of California spring; but still, if the Frazer country only is rich enough to justify the operation, I know of some thousands of fellows who would sink shafts seventy feet deep, through solid ice, and then &quot;coyote&quot; round underneath just as long as they could “make it pay.” Toil, hardship and danger, are only secondary considerations in gold diggings. </p><p>The unsettled condition of the land titles in this State, has now assumed a most portentious and alarming character. Nearly all of the good farming land in the country is covered by immense Spanish grants. Many of them good, the majority of them fraudulent, and few of them clearly defined as to their extent, location, and boundaries, so that thousands of settlers, who a few years ago took up lands and made their homes on what was then believed to be government land, now find their flourishing farms covered by some confounded “grant.&quot; </p><p>Some three months ago, the Supreme Court decided the &quot;Act for the protection of actual settlers, and to quiet land titles in the State,” to be unconstitutional; and since then, the horde of merciless land speculators and Spanish grant holders, have been coming into collision with the settlers or &quot;squatters,&quot; and instuting ejectment suits against them. Serious difficulties have already occurred, and unless the general government takes the matter in hand, there may be some fighting done, for the settlers are everywhere holding meetings and forming leagues, for mutual protection against the land grabbers.</p><p>In my last letter, I gave an account of an affray proceeding from one of these land quarrels, which took place near Mountain View, resulting in the death of Paul Shores, and the stabbing of his brother James Shores. Thomas Seale, Samuel J. Crosby, and Alexander Reobb, were the assaulting party. Seale shot Paul Shores with a Derringer pistol, and Crosby handed him a revolver, with which he again shot Shores as he lay upon the ground. Reobb stabbed James Shores. The three murderers remained in prison at San Jose until the 5th ult, when the Grand Jury found true bills of indictment against Seale and Reobb for murder, but no bill against Crosby, who was therefore released, and the others remanded to prison to await their trial. Crosby, however, dared not show himself abroad, but kept himself pretty close in San Jose, for fear of being lynched. The action of the grand jury was unaccountable in any other light than that they were tampered with by money, which no doubt was the case, as Seale and Crosby were monied and influential men, and the plan probably was, that Crosby should be cleared in order that he might act as witness to clear Seale and Reobb. But such a daring attempt to defeat the ends of justice, of course roused the indignation of the people. A mass meeting was held at Mountain View, and a series of resolutions passed, strongly condemning the action of the grand jury, and holding up to public contempt the names of the three members who were the means of Crosby's release, and directly charging them with having sold themselves for money. These three were then placed in effigy in the street, kicked about in the dirt, and spit upon, then they were hung up by the necks and burnt, and afterward <em>their ashes blown off with gunpowder</em>. It was carried out in true western style, and the whole proceedings published in the public newspapers. Crosby did not venture to expose himself much in public, for he well knew that there were many friends of the murdered Paul Shores who would not hesitate to take his life, if they only had the opportunity. Richard Shares also came down from the mines, and swore to avenge his brother Paul's death. </p><p>On Tuesday last, the 29th ult., the case of Seale and Reobb was to have been tried in the 3d Judicial District Court at San Jose, at 2 o'clock P.M. I happened to be in town on business, and saw the people gathering in from Mountain View and vicinity, all anxious and deeply interested in the result of this trial. The father and brothers of the murdered man were among them. </p><p>About 11 o'clock A.M., I was in the Post Office, when on a sudden a rapid discharge of firearms was heard, and immediately a general rush was made towards the court house, some three or four blocks distant. Of course I did as everybody else does, joined the rush. Crosby lay just across the street from the Court House, on the sidewalk, dead, with no less than five balls through his body, about all of them through his chest. </p><p>It seems that the Shores and their friends happened to be near the Court room when Crosby, who had been in to the jail to see his friend Beale, passed along, and as he crossed the street he saw a man whom it is supposed he mistook for Richard Shores, passing along in front of the Court room, and immediately drew his revolver and fired at him. The ball missed him, however, and passed through the front of the building, and lodged in the breast of a young man by the name of Ferguson, who immediately fell and died in about half an hour. He was just down from the mines, and was to have gone home to Missouri by this steamer. Immediately upon Crosby firing this first shot, more than a dozen revolvers came into action and he was shot down. He however fired every shot from his revolver, and had drawn another one, before he was killed. None of his shots took effect except the one which accidentally killed poor Ferguson. That ball passed through a 3 1-2 inch planking, and was from one of Colt's Navy size revolvers. </p><p>There were many that took part in the shooting, but Richard Shores was the foremost. No arrests were made, but a day or two afterwards the Shores gave themselves up, and yesterday were bound over in the sum of $1000 to appear before the Court of Sessions. This is however, a mere matter of form, and nothing will be done with them. Seale and Reobb were granted a change of venues to Alameda County for trial, which was just, for they surely could not have an impartial trial here in this county.

Rockns08,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – No. VIII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., May 18<sup>th</sup>, 1859.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -</p><p>All's well in this quarter just at present, and for the past few weeks few incidents have occurred calculated to disturb California equanimity; but such a state of things can't last long. Somebody must be shot, a town or so must burn up, or else some extra earthquake must give the state a jolly good shaking, just to stir up the people and give us all something to talk about.</p><p>We have had good seasonable rains, which have brought the grain crops forward finely, although in some portions of the state the farmers complain of drought. But it seems rather of a difficult operation to get rain enough at any one time to wet the entire state, therefore some parts are more favored than others. The winters of ‘49 and '52 were the winters when the state got well soaked; but such winters as those are now out of fashion, and we don't look for such any more. </p><p>We are all now busy haying, and all over the level face of the valley the glittering scythes are at work among the sweet grasses and clover. The mountain sides too are being shorn of their verdant covering of wild oats, esteemed generally as the best hay of all. Mowing machines of various patterns also are laying the grass by the wholesale. They can cut from ten to fifteen acres per day. They charge a dollar or a dollar and a quarter per acre, and the same machines will be used for reaping grain in harvest. </p><p>May parties and May festivals were held throughout the state during the first week of this month, and everywhere the little children were specially licensed for a good time generally, and frolicked in joyous glee, together with those of larger growth. The different schools in San Jose and Santa Clara, each had a party or picnic, held in some of the many beautiful groves about here.</p><p>A decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, received here by the last mail, changes the aspect of things materially in regard to the land titles in this state. This will have the effect to bring the majority if not all of these perplexed grants back into court again for re-hearing, and now that people have their eyes opened in regard to them, most of them will be puzzled to prove that they have in reality any valid claim at all. Very many of them, indeed, will be thrown out of court as being found fraudulent and good for nothing, even some of those which have been already confirmed by the commissioners and have received their patents. The thieving land-grabbers and bogus grant-holders have had their way full long enough and now, for the first time, the honest actual settlers have an equal show with them. </p><p>At San Leandro, on the 22d ult., the jury in the case of Thomas Seale, charged with the murder of Paul Shores, brought in a verdict of <em>&quot;not </em>guilty,&quot; and he was accordingly discharged and a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was entered in the case of Alexander Robb, his accomplice. This was the second jury, the first one being unable to agree, standing nine for conviction and three for acquittal. Reobb, although indicted equally with Seale for murder, by the Grand Jury, was by some strange working of the cards brought into court as <em>witness for Seale. </em>Of course he did some pretty hard swearing to clear Seale and himself. It would seem from this that in case of murder an accomplice is really necessary, that the two might swear each other clear. People generally don't seem to think it altogether &quot;on the square,&quot; but there it is, and the two murderers are again turned loose among society, fully licensed to do the thing over again if they choose. Seale is a rich man and has gone back to his big ranch again, but he keeps out of the way. In that he does well, for it would not be at all surprising, at any time, to hear that he was killed by the relatives or friends of Shores, as Crosby was at San Jose. </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns08.jpg
Rockns09,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – No. IX.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Aug. 3d, 1859.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK: - Perhaps you thought from my long silence, that your old correspondent had quite forgotten you; but let me assure you, such is not the case. As excuse for not having written you for the last few weeks, I must plead hard work, busy times harvesting, no opportunity &amp;c., and promise to do better in future. </p><p>Throughout the valley part at the present time, everybody is very busy indeed, and on all the surrounding ranches, the ripe, golden grain may be seen, in process of being harvested. No one has an excuse now for being idle, for there is plenty of work, and wages are two dollars per day, and boarded. The grain crop this year is very heavy, and we shall have a large surplus for exportation; nearly twice as much wheat having been raised this year, as in any previous season. Passing through Alameda County, two or three weeks since, I saw near San Leandro several thousand acres of grain all in one vast level body, spread out for miles, and miles along on each side of the road, with long lines of fences running through it, marking out each ones' possessions. Alameda County is the best portion of the State for grain growing. </p><p>The grain is always cut by machines - hand sickles, and cradles, being wholly unknown, or cast aside. These machines are of various patterns and patents, and are generally drawn by four horses. They go round and round a field of grain, mowing a swarth of from five to seven feet wide, cutting at the rate of about fifteen acres per day, and leaving the grain in small bunches all over the field. This is then taken in wagons and put into stack, or taken direct to the threshing machine; or if the straw is long enough, eight or ten men bind it up as fast as the reaper cuts it. </p><p>But even these reaping machines, although a great saving of labor and expense, are now in a great measure superceded and thrown into the shade by a better invention, called the &quot;clipper&quot; or &quot;header,&quot; which has come into general use this season. This machine is likewise propelled by four horses, and cuts a swarth of ten feet and more in width, and will cut twenty five acres per day. It does not however, like the reaper, cut near the ground, but merely cuts off the heads of the grain, and a broad canvas belt, running part back of the knives, carries the heads of grain obliquely up a wide spout, which projects over the side, and deposits the grain into a big box on wheels, drawn by a span of horses, and driven along by the side of the machine. When the box is full, it is driven off, and another takes its place. Each clipper has three of these boxes, and they haul the grain into stack, or direct to the threshing machine, which is rather the quickest, cheapest, and best way, the thresher being placed in the middle of the field for the purpose. </p><p>When these two machines work together, they employ some twelve or fourteen men, and and from twenty-two to twenty-five horses. It is really a fine stirring sight, to see so many horses and men in the field, all in motion, and doing up work so expeditiously. A hundred acres of grain is thus cut, threshed, and sacked up ready for market in four days. l wrote you about this time last year, of still another machine, called &quot;harvester,&quot; which cuts, threshes, and sacks up the grain, all at one operation; leaving the grain in sacks all over the field. But they have not yet got that machine to working perfectly. </p><p>Now is the &quot;dry season&quot; with us. No rain has fallen since last spring; consequently, California has had to ''dry up.&quot; No green blade of grass is found on the parched hill sides, but yet the dry grass is as good as hay for cattle, and will be so until the first rains in the fall, which soon takes the nourishment out of it. </p><p>Speaking of this dry grass as feed for cattle, reminds me of a droll joke I heard the other day. An outrageous wag of my acquaintance edifying a friend of his who had just arrived here from the &quot;States,&quot; in regard to the manners and customs peculiar to California, and to the many curious questions that his friend asked him, he made some rather curious replies. Among other questions was this: &quot;How is it that the cattle all keep so fat when the feed on the hillside is dried up?&quot; “O,” replied my friend, &quot;as soon as the green grass is dried up, we just put a pair of green goggles on the eyes of each animal, which makes the dry feed appear green again; and in this way we find no difficulty in keeping them 'rolling fat' the year round.&quot;</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns09.jpg
Rockns10,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – No. X. <br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Sept. 18<sup>th</sup>, 1859. </p><p>DEAR ROCK: </p><p>Since my last, much has transpired to interest the California public, and keep our minds in an unusual state of ferment. </p><p>Horace Greeley has been here, taken a hurried, though perhaps sufficient view of us, spoken to us on various occasions, and gone home to New York to report as well as his limited stay among us may have qualified him. Of course, while here, he was lionized and made much of, as &quot;one of the most extraordinary men of the age.&quot; Everybody saw him that could. He was the great literary &quot;elephant&quot; that it was highly essential to go and &quot;see.&quot; Therefore he always addressed immense and admiring crowds. </p><p>Bayard Taylor too, has paid us a visit, but has been rather lost sight of, in the excitement of the State election. He also is an &quot;elephant,&quot; every one feels anxious to get a peep at the noted traveler, of whom we have read so much. </p><p>Our State election came off on the 7th inst. It passed very quietly and satisfactorily throughout the State. Democratic, Republican, Lecompton and Settler were the four different tickets. All the returns are not in yet from the most remote portions of the State, but it has undoubtedly gone largely Democratic. The Settlers ran a pretty strong ticket, nominated from the other tickets, but carried but few points. Milton S. Latham, will most probably be our next Governor. </p><p>But the great event of the day, is the duel which came off on Tuesday last - the 13th inst., between Hon. David C. Broderick, U. S. Senator, and Hon. D. S. Terry, Chief Justice of the Superior Court. They fought at Davis' ranch, in San Mateo County, some twenty miles from San Francisco. The distance was ten paces, and the weapons duelling pistols. At the first fire, Broderick fell mortally wounded. &quot;The ball entered his right breast between the second and third ribs; passed under the sternum, fracturing the edge of it; passed over the heart, through the upper lobe of the left lung, and fracturing the fifth rib. The ball then took an upward direction through the left arm pit, and lodged in the back muscle of the left arm.&quot; He died Friday morning at 9 1-2 o'clock. </p><p>This sad affair has cast a gloom over the State, any many murmur the loss of Broderick. As a public man, he had of course his enemies, but with the masses of the people he was a general and very popular favorite. Judge Terry, it will be recollected, was once in the hands of the San Francisco Vigilance Committee for stabbing S. A. Hopkins in the street. He came very near getting served as Casey and Cora were at that time, and as the sequel has proved, they did very wrong in not suspending him also. A most righteous Judge indeed to adorn a Supreme Bench.</p><p>Severe talk, politically, led to this fatal duel, or rather it should be called murder, for it was in reality no less. Terry was an expert and well practiced shot, as good, if not the best in the State, while Broderick was an awkward and entirely unpracticed one; so that his pistol exploded before the word was given, and while raising it to fire. The ball struck the ground a few feet in front of Terry, thus leaving him entirely at Terry’s mercy. But Terry very deliberately drew a bead upon Broderick's heart and fired. The papers to-day and yesterday are all dressed in mourning, and are loud in condemnation of Judge Terry. </p><p>Measures are being taken to arrest Terry and the public demand that full justice should be dealt out to him. But still it is to be feared that he will be passed over lightly, with a sort of form of a trial just to wool the eyes of the people. I honestly wish, as do thousands of others, that the Vigilance Committee had his case once more in hand. Judge Terry's punishment could be calculated upon to a moral certainty. His career thus far in this State has been one little calculated to win for him anything but the execrations of the public, while that of Broderick has been one of marked brilliancy and success, winning for him the esteem and love of all honest men. </p><p>He has left more and stronger friends in California than any other man ever had; he has also left more malignant and relentless enemies. He was a great and talented man, and has fallen in the great battle against slavery extension. His own words when brought in from the field, and suffering already under the pangs of death were - &quot;They have killed me because r was opposed to the extension of slavery and a corrupt Administration.&quot; His last words were, &quot;I die - protect my honor.&quot; </p><p>His funeral takes place to-day, at 1 1-2 o'clock P. M., from the Union Hotel. All the civic societies and Associations in the city will attend the funeral in citizens dress, and without music. The military all voluntered to do escort duty, but their services were respectfully declined by the Committee of Arrangements. Solemn High Mass takes place during the morning at St. Mary's Cathedral, and Col. E. D. Baker will deliver a funeral oration on the Plaza. But </p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns10.jpg
Rockns11,"<p>California Correspondence.<br /><br />NEW SERIES – No. XI. <br /><br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Nov. 18<sup>th</sup>, 1859.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:- </p><p>Time flies on; but yet little news of much interest transpires within the Golden State. Our annual state and county fairs are now all over with for this year. The fair in this county closed a few days ago, and it decidedly surpassed any previous one that has been held here, and in some points rather went ahead of the state fair which was held at Sacramento. </p><p>The show of stock was especially fine, and so choice a lot of thoroughbred horseflesh is hard to find in any state. &quot;Belmont,&quot; the premium stallion, whose pedigree extends through a long line of illustrious ancestry, away back to the far-famed barb of the Arabian deserts, is a most splendid animal, and it would take many thousands of dollars to buy him. The &quot;Black Hawk&quot; stock of the &quot;Morgan&quot; breed of horses was well represented, and other noble animals of scarcely inferior merit were also there, displaying in their fine symmetry of form, and beauty of action, a marked and striking contrast to the common stock of horses in every-day use. </p><p>Of the horned stock, the Durhams and Devons were most prominent, and among them were many fine animals of high and illustrious pedigree, “Washington,&quot; a young Durham bull just imported at a cost of twenty-eight hundred dollars by R. Blacon, Esq. of Alameda county, attracted much attention, but the premium - of one hundred dollars - was taken by &quot;Guelph,&quot; a noble large Durham bull. The second, by “John O'Guelph,&quot; also a Durham, and the third premium was given to &quot;Prince of the Pacific,&quot; the yearling calf of “Lady Bolton,&quot; a thoroughbred Durham heifer. These premium animals are owned by Mr. Emerson of Mountain View, and were imported by him two years ago. They also took the premium of the state fair. - Much attention is given to the improvement of horned stock by the breeders in this state, and the time will soon come when the general breed of cattle in California will be as fine as in any part of the world.</p><p>At the fair ground is a splendid race-track, and many grand races came off during the fair. Fine trotting matches by some of the celebrated racers, serab races, free for all sorts of horses, and loot races, in which the “fast boys&quot; tried their speed. </p><p>In the hall of exhibition was a grand and profuse display of very large and luscious fruit of every description, also a numerous collection of machines, tools and implements of various uses, and specimens of handiwork. The show of vegetables was of course what you might expect to see here, of the <em>tremendous</em> kind. Beets that beat all creation; potatoes, onions, carrots and turnips that defy the world to &quot;turn up&quot; any that can equal them in size; and as for squashes, they were of the big kind, too, weighing as high as one hundred and seventeen (117) lbs. </p><p>The beginning of this month ushered the &quot;rainy season&quot; upon us and as with the first rains the grass always starts, the old mountain sides are now clothed in a fresh spring dress of green. The farmers are commencing to plough again for another crop; in fact, many hundred acres are already ploughed and sown. The superabundant crop of wheat this year has glutted the market, consequently the price rules at a very low figure, and the farmers, as well as everybody else, are growling about &quot;hard times,&quot; and the great scarcity of money. Provisions, however, of all kinds, are very plenty, and very cheap, and flour is only $6.50 per barrel, for the very best. </p><p>In the gold mining region discoveries have lately been made of new, extensive and very rich gold diggings. They are on the Eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, and situated on the Eastern fork of Walker's river, lying almost wholly within the boundaries of Utah territory. It is a sterile and bleak country there, with nothing but brush, and a few scrub willows for firewood; - and nothing but rock to build cabins of. Some mining has been done near there for the last three or four years, but this season these new diggings were discovered about four miles South of the old ones, on some small streams and gulches. </p><p>The diggings are generally very good, and some claims are paying from ten, to fifty, and even a hundred dollars per day to the man, and only working with rockers, at that. There are only some four hundred miners there at present, owing to the severity of the weather, and the approach of winter, but a great rush will be made there next spring, and farther discoveries will undoubtedly be made, as the surrounding country presents a highly auriferous appearance. These diggings are about three hundred miles from Sacramento and Stockton, and the way to them is to follow the old emigrant roads, over the Sierra Nevada, to Carson Valley, and then it is but a short distance to cross over to Walker's River. </p><p>In June last, valuable silver mines were discovered near Washoe Valley, about nine miles West of Carson River, and about half way up the Eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. </p><p>Considerable excitement exists in regard to them, and quite a rush is made to that locality. The discoveries are rather limited at present. The richest vein (the Comstock vein) is from six to twenty inches in width, and was found at the surface of the ground. The ore is very rich, indeed, yielding from five hundred to seven thousand dollars per ton, and it costs from one hundred, to one hundred and fifty dollars per ton, to take it to San Francisco to be melted. Some of it has been shipped to England for that purpose, but arrangements are now being made for melting it at the mines. Shares in this vein are held as high as twenty-five thousand dollars each, and even more; and these mines now bid fair to eclipse the celebrated silver mines of Potosi, in Peru. But no mas ahora.</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns11.jpg
Rockns12,"<p>California Correspondence.</p><p>NEW SERIES – No. XII.</p><p>Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., <br />Cal., Jan. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1860.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:-</p><p>Another &quot;happy new year&quot; to you. Ever &quot;moving on” toward the unknown future, ever progressing onward in the journey of life, hopefully we look forward to each coming year; and as one after another, they glide so noiselessly by to join their companions of the past, let us bid them a kind adieu with their joys and their sorrows, and trustingly look forward to the good that may be in store for us. If there is trouble and sorrow ahead, we shall meet it soon enough, without anticipating it. </p><p>But little transpires now-a-days in the shape of news, for me to write about. We are having a very favorable winter if it thus far. Much rain has fallen, to gladden the hearts of both miners and farmers; for surely, to the miner in the dry diggings, nothing could be more acceptable, next to plenty of gold, than a jolly good rain. And the farmer, too, can have no serious objections to the natural irrigation of the land where his crops are sown, giving him a comfortable assurance of a good harvest in prospective. </p><p>Christmas is made rather more account of here, as well as in the Southern and Western States I think, than it is with you. Christmas seems to be set apart as an occasion of mirth and happiness; a time for eating good things and making presents; a time when the merchant may shut up his shop, the farmer leave his plow and turn his horses out to roll in the green pasture, and the miner lay aside his pick, and all, everybody, feel especially licensed to be jolly generally; in short, even the dogs in the streets get better pickings, and never feel like growling or fighting on that happy occasion. Then the toy shops too, they do a stiff business about that time, in the doll and pop-gun line, and other articles with which to fill the suspended stockings, and tickle the fancy of Young America. </p><p>Our trade with Japan is beginning to assume quite an importance, and two or three cargoes of goods have lately arrived here from that country, so long a sealed book to all except the nation of schnapps and sour kraut. These cargoes are made up mostly of rice, lacquered ware, silks, dried fruit, preserves, carved toys, vases, and other Japanese contrivances of odd design and queer workmanship. A peculiar variety of rice comes from there, much larger than ordinary rice, and as large as hulled barley, The Japanese are rather shy and restricted as yet in trading with us, but this will probably all come round right, by and by. </p><p>Anderson, &quot;the great wizard of the North,&quot; is now performing a grand engagement at Maguire's Opera House, San Francisco, and nightly draws crowded houses. Great is the rush of the wonder-seekers to see him; and this indeed wonderful magician - who no doubt is one of the same who figures so largely in the Arabian Nights - has, by his inexplicable tricks, astounding deception, and off-hand <em>disablerie</em>, already fully convinced several susceptible individuals that he is the original Beelzebub himself, of whom we read. All modern magicians may doff their respectful hats and bow their humiliated heads before him, their great master. </p><p>Next in order comes &quot;the fat woman,&quot; Madame Sherwood. I don't know but you may have seen or heard of her before. She was on exhibition in San Francisco, but is now up country astonishing the miners. A few days ago I was in the city, and in the evening, passing up Bush street, my attention was arrested by a large transparency, on which was a huge daub of dirty brown paint, supposed to be representing a woman of very mammoth proportions, dressed in a bright blue dress. And near it, hung another transparency representing an immense serpent. Thinking this must be no less than Eve, and the arch tempter with the apple, direct from the Garden of Eden, your correspondent immediately invested &quot;two bits admission,” and followed the people that were stringing in to the open door near by. A lot of tall Pikes and Hoosiers prevented my seeing anything, at first, but by dint of hard crowding, shouldering through edgeways (you know how,) and representing myself as an <em>editor</em>, I managed to work myself into a good place among the women and girls. </p><p>An agreeable man with a black moustache, was handling the big &quot;snaik,&quot; shouldering portions of him, patting its pretty head, and smoothing his hand along its cold shiny hide, all the while, in a loud voice, describing the various beauties and good qualities of the varmint, its great docility, sweet disposition, its natural capabilities in the way of swallowing small cattle, &amp;c. It was a boa constrictor, 28 feet long, and weighing 240 lbs. Then there was &quot;the infant snake,&quot; of the same sort, and weighing 110 pounds; length, 18 feet. </p><p>Having disposed of the snake department, he introduced Madame Sherwood to us, who thereupon rose, stood up on the stage and bowed as well as she could, to the audience. He then went on to tell of and describe her points and qualities as he had done the snake. “28 years old - native of Ireland, but has lived in the States for the last 11 years - height five feet - circumference round the waist, seven feet - weight, 643 lbs. - kind disposition - eats no more than a common person - enjoys perfect health - never was sick,” &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Now she <em>was</em> a bouncer. Just think of it, six hundred and forty-three pounds of human flesh all in one lump.</p><p>Take it all round, it seemed rather of an interesting exhibition, and I came away fully impressed with the conviction that if any mortal Adam could be tempted by such an Eve as that, he must be fond of apples.

All classes of us are anxiously looking forward and wondering who are to be the two great nominees for the presidency and our standard bearers in the approaching campaign.</p><p>The nominating conventions soon to assemble, have a heavy responsibility resting upon them, and have nice points to discuss as to the suitability and availability of those whom they may nominate. </p><p>There are only two great parties to contend in the coming struggle, and they are now only waiting to hear the names of their leaders, to inscribe them upon their banners, and spread them to the breeze. </p><p>We cannot avoid the fact that the contest will be almost entirely on the slavery question; a struggle between freedom and slavery; but although this will vastly influence us of the Pacific, yet having long ago settled the point, that our portion of Uncle's Sam's dominions shall belong to the land of freedom, what is of permanent importance to us, and what will sway our vote, will be the stand taken by our opposing candidates and parties, in relation to the Pacific Railroad - that great project of the nineteenth century; a project which speaks but little for American go-ahead-ativeness, for surely, during the time we have been quarreling about it, we could have built the road and had the iron horse dashing across the broad Plains, and snorting through the deep passes of mountain ranges. </p><p>The great Pathfinder, Fremont, in days past, found his way across the trackless plains and deserts, to California. Private enterprise followed with an ox-team. Private enterprise put on an overland stage line. Private enterprise is now putting the lightning wire across. Private enterprise in a week or two, will put on a horse express, running over the mail route, at the average rate of eight miles an hour, and expect to deliver despatches at the terminus of the telegraph line in Carson Valley in <em>six days from Leavenworth, Mo.</em> This will bring us within a week's communication of New York, National enterprise should build the railroad, but if it really won't, why just let private enterprise have a show at it, and it will be done right speedily. </p><p>Washoe mining stock stands high in the market. Frazer River stock, down below redemption. Washoe is no humbug; plenty of the precious metal is certainly there, for the reason that it comes from there in plenty. Frazer <em>was</em> a humbug, for but little gold was found there, consequently but little ever came from there. It was a &quot;great cry and little wool,&quot; unless we may call it a &quot;golden fleece&quot; for the thousands who wildly rushed thither got most gloriously &quot;fleeced.&quot; Such doleful stories they told when they made out to get back, about the programme of sufferings and privations they had to go through in getting there, while they were there and the great difficulty of getting back again. </p><p>In going to Washoe, all a fellow has to do is to shoulder his blanket if he chooses, and take the conveyance that Nature provides; that is to say, &quot;take up his bed and walk;&quot; and after a pleasant little journey of four or five days over a fine mountain road, he comes to Washoe, where they find the silver. If he don't like silver, he can go into digging gold; and if that don't suit him, or he don't exactly happen to like that region of country, he can just quietly shoulder his blankets again, and the same legs that took him there may bring him back, not starved at all, and much out of pocket either. </p><p>Winter has checked operations somewhat in that quarter, but still new and rich discoveries of the precious metals have been made, and from all parts of the state there will be a grand rush as soon as the spring is fairly opened. It is cold, and there is plenty of snow in that region of the Sierra at present. </p><p>As I said before, these mines are no humbug; they may not be so rich as they are now supposed to be, but as silver has come in abundance from Washoe, it is fair to presume that there is &quot;plenty more where that came from.&quot; In San Francisco it is coined into bright new half dollars at the mint, and in the jewellers' shops it is in the shape of spoons, knives, forks, &amp;c. Barret &amp; Sherwood on Montgomery st., have a cake of it in their show window, about the size of a fry-pan. The San Francisco brokers and speculators run heavy on stocks in the Washoe silver leads, and claims there are valued at so much per foot of the vein. Some leads are worth many thousands of dollars per foot. </p><p>The land tiller here still continues to be a great source of trouble, annoyance, and litigation, and instead of becoming settled, they seem to be getting more and more mixed up. Many of them, confirmed grants, and some of them with the United States patent issued upon them, are having their surveys sent back from Washington, as having more land surveyed in, than belongs to them; but there are so many of these grants, covering the whole country, and overlapping each other, that there is but small show for government land. Ejectment suits by the grantees, to eject the settlers, or “squatters,” are prosecuted on all sides, and the numerous lawyers are growing corpulent with fat fees. </p><p>The past winter has been very favorable, and very extensive fields of grain have been put in; in fact, although we had an overplus of wheat last season, and the market was glutted, yet still larger crops of it were sown this season, and everything promises another bountiful crop.- Well, bread will be cheap. </p><p>Flour is now from $5.25 to $6.50 per barrel; wheat, from 1 3/4 to 2 c per pound; barley, 2½ cts.

Rockns14,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />NEW SERIES – N. XIV.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., May 20<sup>th</sup>, 1860.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>At the present writing, great excitement exists in regard to the late and important news of the Indian massacres in Carson Valley. The new mining region has suddenly become the theatre of wholesale butchery. The blood of friends and fellow citizens cries for vengeance. The Indian warriors are out upon the war-path, and the fresh blood upon their scalping knives is the blood of the white man. The call is &quot;to arms!&quot; The country is aroused, and troops are hurrying across the Sierra, to the scene of action. </p><p>These hostilities commenced by an attack of the Indians on Miller's Station, at the Big Bend of Carson River, on the night of the 7th inst., in which four white men were massacred. As soon as practicable, a company of about a hundred men, under the command of Maj. Ormsby, from Carson City, Virginia, and other points, started in pursuit of the murderers. </p><p>On the afternoon of the 12th, when near Pyramid Lake, they fell into an ambush of the Indians, who were judged to be some two thousand strong. The fight against such odds was of course not of long duration, and the whites were obliged to retreat, and escape the best way they could, leaving Maj. Ormsby and many others, dead upon the field. How many were killed is not precisely known yet, but it is supposed about twenty-five. A prospecting party of seven men were all found murdered at the crossing of Truckee River. </p><p>The telegraph from Carson City at once flashed the news across the Sierra to California, calling earnestly for arms and ammunition, of which there was a scarcity. The Mayor of Sacramento immediately called a meeting of the citizens, and, thoroughly aroused to a sense of the danger which menaced their friends in Carson Valley, prompt measures were taken, and plenty of arms, ammunition, and assistance, were quickly on their way thither. </p><p>In San Francisco the receipt of the news caused a more intense excitement than has been felt for a long time. The fact that two thousand savages were devastating a region where are so many of our friends and kindred, and slaying all who fall within their power, was enough to profoundly stir the hearts of the whole community. </p><p>Governor Downey immediately issued a requisition to Maj. Gen Clarke, commanding Pacific Division U.S. Army to furnish all troops, arms, &amp;c. that were deemed necessary. In answer to this requisition, Gen. Clarke ordered out Capt. Stewart's Third Artillery company from Alcatraz Island, of eighty men, and Capt. Flint's Sixth Infantry, from Benecia, of seventy men, who took passage in the steamer Eclipse Thursday afternoon, en route for the seat of war. He also sent along two mountain howitzers, with ten men from the Third Artillery at the Presidio, to take charge of them. Also 500 stand of arms and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. The Secretary of State sent 200 stand of arms, with ammunition &amp;c. from Sacramento. Adjutant General Haven commands the forces.</p><p>The Nevada Rifles were ordered to proceed at once from Nevada to the scene of action, and they are most probably there by this time. The military companies of Sacramento, Marysville, and Coloma, are also under orders to hold themselves in readiness, in case they should be required by the Governor. A committee of fifteen citizens from Sacramento have gone to the relief of their friends, escorting 200 Minie rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. </p><p>No more troops will probably be required to be sent, as there are plenty of men in the new mining region who will not object to being on U.S. pay and rations for a while; and the people there did not ask for troops, but only for arms and ammunition to fight with. </p><p>What considerably embitters this excitement is the fact that the Mormons are reported to be leagued with, and assisting the Indians, and were seen with them in the battle with Maj. Ormsby's party. One thing is certain; if the Indians happen to want anything, they can now have it. - They must pay dearly for the blood they have shed. The general feeling towards them is that they should be utterly exterminated, and if the Mormons are having a hand in this bloody game, their nest at Salt Lake should be at once broken up, and the old arch traitor Brigham Young and his chief confederates, served as the Virginians served <em>old John Brown</em>. There are plenty here in California who would be only too glad to have permission to go and break up that corrupted nest of rascality, and charge nothing for the job. </p><p>Col. F. W. Lander and party, comprising the U.S. wagon road Expedition, arrived in the last steamer, and leave soon for the field of their labors. His instructions are, to complete the survey of the route on which he has been at work during the last two years, to make an accurate map of the same, to improve the road from the great bend of the Humboldt to the State line of California, so as to make it easy for emigrants' wagons, and to build earthen water-tanks at suitable places in the desert region between the Humboldt and the foot hills of the Sierra Nevada. </p><p>Col. Lander's party numbers some forty or fifty men, and as they are going directly into the country of the hostile savages, they are going perfectly prepared with arms of the most effective description. </p><p>But amid all this excitement, politics is not lost sight of. Since the Pony Express brought the news of the failure of the Charleston Convention to nominate a candidate for the Presidency, Republican stock has risen high in the market. They think they are now sure to carry California this fall, and that a Republican President will be inaugurated on the 4th of March next. And excuse me for saying I think so too. </p><p>The Rev. Thomas Starr King, although so recently arrived here, is very popular in San Francisco, and people flock by thousands to hear him preach on Sundays. He also lectures to crowded houses evenings during the week. </p><p>Miss Jane M. Davenport, the distinguished tragedienne, arrived in the last steamer. She was here a few years ago, and established the reputation among us that she everywhere enjoys, as an artiste of the highest order of excellence. She will soon appear at Maguire's Opera House, and will inaugurate a higher order of the drama than has been presented to the theatre going public for some time past. </p><p>A few weeks ago, as you probably saw by the papers, the Japanese Embassy paid us a visit, and gave us a chance to display our obsequious hospitality. They were well entertained, fed on wine, and cheese, and all sorts of good things, well seasoned with flattery, speeches, toasts, &amp;c., and the mercenary hand of friendship, commercially extended to them. We natter ourselves that we made an excellent impression, and of course expect to realize numerous dollars from our future trade with the rich and extensive nation they represent. And now that these Celestial Ambassadors are among you of the Atlantic, if you only treat them as well, in proportion, as we did, they must certainly return to the &quot;Flowery Empire,&quot; well impressed and pleased with their jolly good neighbor Uncle Sam.</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns14.jpg
Rockns15,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No XV<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara, Co., Cal.,<br />Aug. 17<sup>th</sup>, 1860.<br /><br />DEAR ROCK: -- The usual yearly routine of natural consequences, brings us round to harvest once more, and we are now right in the midst of the busiest doings of the whole year. On all sides, far and near, is heard the busy rattle and hum of the various paterned machines employed in cutting and threshing the grain, and everybody is extremely busy. No one has any excuse for being idle. Even the stragglers who are ever ranging the country in search of a &quot;job,&quot; easily find work now, at the standing harvest wages, - $2,00 per day and board. </p><p>And of these stragglers are many who as soon as they are &quot;paid off,&quot; shoulder their blankets, - if they have any, - and strike out for the nearest groggery, and for a short period, while their money lasts, revel in the glories of strychnine whiskey, &quot;choice old French Cognac,&quot; made in San Francisco, and other delectable compounds of alcoholic drugs and hell-fire. </p><p>A day or two may suffice very easily to get rid of the wages of the last week or two, and credit in their case never being given or expected, they must necessarily hunt another &quot;job;&quot; so they take up their old line of march again from ranch to ranch, sure of at least something to eat, for, in harvest, even the meanest kind of a close-fisted Dutchman of a farmer, will not refuse food to one who asks for it, although his door may be closed in the hungry beggar's face for the balance of the year; and as for a place to sleep, haystacks and straw piles lay around loose, everywhere, and constitute the sleeping accommodations of all the harvest hands. When the machines are in the field, harvesting, the farmer has employed, generally from ten to twenty men, add as many or more horses, and the expenses are all the way from fifty to a hundred and fifty dollars per day. </p><p>To say nothing of the various big reaping machines, it is a stirring sight to see the &quot;thresher&quot; in full operation. They also are of many different patterns and patents. “Pitts's,&quot; &quot;Spencer's,&quot; &quot;Russell's&quot; “Hall's,” and others; but the &quot;Pitts's&quot; machine of ten horse power, is most generally in use. The sheaf grain is put in at one end, and at the other end comes out the straw and chaff; while from a spout in the side, the clear grain runs out into the sacks, at the rate of from two hundred to six and even as high as eight hundred sacks of one hundred pounds each, in a day. </p><p>The motive power, or &quot;horse-power,&quot; as it is called, is a heavy combination of cog-wheels, weighing two or three tons, staked fast to the ground, and from it project five sweeps or levers, to the ends of which are attached the five span of horses, who walk round and round in a circle, after the style of the working of a capstan on board of a ship. This horse power is connected with the main threshing machine, or &quot;seperator,&quot; by means of a horizontal iron shaft, called the &quot;tumbling rod,&quot; over which the horses walk. </p><p>The sheaf grain, to be threshed, is crowded by a man called the &quot;feeder,&quot; into a horizontal opening at one end of the &quot;seperator,” about a foot wide by three or four feet long. Here it comes immediately in contact with what is called the &quot;cylinder,&quot; a heavy mass of iron work, armed with short iron spikes or &quot;teeth&quot; which play between a stationary series of similar teeth. This heavy cylinder whirls with lightning like velocity, and tears the heads of the grain into chaff at once, which passes out with the straw, over a series of sieves and fans. </p><p>Many are the accidents, mostly the results of carelessness, which happen around these machines. Fingers placed unwittingly between some of the numerous cog-wheels, are sure to suffer, and sometimes the &quot;feeder,&quot; in crowding in the grain, uncautiously pokes his hand a little too near the spikes of the cylinder, and receives a rap or wound that bids him look out for himself. If his hand should get caught between the spikes, no power on earth could save it. The hand, arm, or something would have to come off at once, or he would be drawn in bodily, in an instant. </p><p>Only last week, I happened to be an eye witness of an accident of the kind, that even now makes my blood run cold as I think of it. Mr. Briggs, a friend of mine was threshing with his machine, at a ranch near here, and having business with him, I went to see him. Just as I rode up, they were stopping the machine for some reason or other. The horses had entirely stopped, but the heavy cylinder always whirls for some few minutes by its own impetus before it stops. Briggs was on top of the machine, and in coming down, he carelessly stepped where his right foot slipped directly in among the teeth of the cylinder. The boot, the flesh, and the bones of the ancle and foot, stopped the whirling cylinder, but not until the leg was destroyed nearly to the knee. </p><p>We were all paralyzed with horror. We knew not what to do. We tried to turn the cylinder back, but he could not bear the pain. The torn muscles were caught among the numerous teeth and he could not be readily extricated. He was the coolest man I ever saw. He did what none of us wanted to do for him. <em>He took out his pocket knife, and cut his leg off</em>. Yes, he cut away the ragged muscles, and pulled himself loose, when he coolly set himself down and gave directions, while we tied a handkerchief tightly around just above the knee. He bled but little. A man on a fast horse rode five miles to San Jose for a surgeon, at once, while we took Briggs on a pile of straw in a wagon, about a mile to a house. He still retained his presence of mind, and did not faint. In due time the surgeon arrived, and amputated the leg just below the knee, and he is now doing well as could be expected. </p><p>The crop now being harvested, exceeds by far the bountiful harvest of last year. The best of flour is five and six dollars per barrel. Wheat is worth only ninety cents per bushel, and barley only fifty cents. </p><p>The Indian war, which was waged with such a fierceness in the Washoe silver mining county at the date of my last letter has entirely died out, and no one seems to want to fight or be fought. Mude silver comes from there, but hardly as much as was anticipated. </p><p>New silver mines have lately been discovered away down South in Tulare County, some 380 miles from San Jose. They are called the “Boso” mines, and are said to be far richer and better than Washoe. A rush is being made in that quarter, <em>of course</em>. I saw one party of four wagons, leave San Jose for the new land of silver, yesterday. May they fill their wagons with the pure article of silver, it is an excellent mineral to have round, especially in one’s pocket, in the absence of gold change.</p><p>Adios BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns15.jpg
Rockns16,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XVI.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara, Co., Cal.,<br />Oct. 17<sup>th</sup>, 1860.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: -- Us of the land of gold and silver, are just now in a state of active fermentation, on the subject of politics, and a highly unusual degree of excitement pervades all classes, in view of the important Presidential contest now so near at hand. In every city, town, village, and precinct, the various political parties are formed into clubs, ready with banners and marshalled forces, to go forth to battle on the 6th of November. All the heavy blowers are out stumping the State from one end to the other, and mass meetings, conventions, caucuses, smart speeches, and general enthusiasm, is the order of the day. </p><p>On the 8th inst., the news from Oregon of the election of Col. E.D. Baker, as Republican U.S. Senator, was received at San Francisco, and signalized by great jollification and the firing of three hundred guns. Having conquered Oregon, the gallant Colonel has now taken the field and stump in California, and is invading the State for the good of the cause. </p><p>The great political parties here consist of three classes, namely: Republicans, Douglasites, and Breckinridge men. The two latter classes both claim to be the regular genuine true blue Democratic party, and it is rather difficult to decide which is which, as they are both made up principally of Irish, Catholics, Greasers and Lawyers. The miners, farmers, and in short all the most respectable portion of the community are Republicans, and I say they are going to carry the election on the 6th of November. You see if they don't. Four years ago, about now, I was very confident, just as I am now, and told you that Fremont was bound to carry this State. Well, I <em>was</em> wrong then, but I am just certain I am right this time. At any rate, although I am no sporting man, I'll bet you ten sacks of barley against two quintals of cod-fish, that California will go Republican. </p><p>Silver still continues to come from Washoe, but not by any means in such great quantities as was at first anticipated; in fact the tremendous excitement which existed in regard to that famous locality seems to have been attended with a sort of natural reaction. The attention of the excitable was drawn to a new locality some few weeks ago in the “Coso” migration, of which I wrote in my last, and lots of silver seekers emigrated thither, but I fear with little success, as we do not hear any very encouraging news from there lately. </p><p>We had a most bountiful crop of everything this year, therefore produce of all kinds is cheap. Flour is $5,00 and $5,25 per bbl., wheat from 1 1-4 to 1 1-2 cents per lb., barley 1 cent per lb., potatoes 1-2 to 3-4 cents per lb. Fruit of all kinds is plenty and cheap, and a better assortment, &quot;down east&quot; cannot produce. As to that matter, we can raise larger and better fruit here and more of it, than anywhere else in the world. The climate and soil is peculiarly adapted to fruit growing, and although the orchards are all young, they come into bearing very early. Most farmers have an orchard and a vineyard. </p><p>Peaches hardly paid to take to market this season. There were no late frosts to nip the fruit this last spring, so the peaches had a good chance, and were so plenty that the price was merely nominal, and large, luscious, downy-cheeked peaches laid and rotted under the trees, for lack of some one to come and eat them. </p><p>The land titles still continue to be in the same uncertain and entangled state as ever. It seems as though they never would be settled. Our government did very wrong at the time we acquired California, in recognizing any of these Spanish grants; or she should have definitely ascertained the locality and boundary of each one of them, and settled their cases at once, or bought them out. Most of the grants now in existence have been fraudulently manufactured since our possession of the country, and even the grants that are considered good, have been in almost all instances surveyed in such a manner as to include a great deal more land than should rightfully belong to them. In this valley many grants cover one another, so that as many as three and four grants cover the same section of country. Only one of these conflicting grants can be valid, and such points should have been settled long ago. Judge Hoffman, in the U.S. District Court, is now very busy trying to settle these claims, and is rejecting and breaking up all of these that he finds to be fraudulent. He is also endeavoring to regulate the lines of the grants which are supposed to be good. </p><p>The season for fairs now getting pretty nearly through with. The Mechanic's Fair, the State Fair, and the various County Fairs, have been held. The San Francisco Bay District Fair was concluded day before yesterday. The Santa Clara County Fair commences at San Jose on the 23d inst., and will be the last of the season. But –</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns16.jpg
Rockns17,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XVII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />Dec. 25<sup>th</sup>, 1860.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>It is Christmas to-day, here in California, as well as with you home christians of the Old Colony, and it probably observed about the same, as a general thing; if anything, it is rather more of a holiday here, than with you. Last evening, many was the young heart that was made joyful by a visit from old Santa Claus, who so benevolently perambulates the world on Christmas eve, regardless of rain, wind, snow or frost, for the express purpose of delivering expected, and unexpected presents, and filling the numerous juvenile stockings he finds hanging with open mouths, wishfully ready to receive any stray blessings the good Patron Saint may be pleased to deposit therein. </p><p>The dealers in toys, fancy articles, and pretty books, are now doing a brisk business, indeed, and last night old Santa Claus had to start out with a large mule train heavily packed with his millions of small traps, his old reindeer sleigh not being anywhere near of sufficient capacity for the purpose. How the warm blood danced in juvenile veins, and eyes merrily twinkled this morning, as the highly acceptable Christmas presents were joyously displayed. </p><p>This suspension of hosiery is not always confined to the juvenile population, altogether. - I was once just chucklehead enough to try my hand at it. I was in the mines. I only had one pair of stockings, so when I turned into my bunk for the night, I took the best stocking of the two, and hung it outside my cabin door. Next morning, when I turned out, I opened the door, and found that the stocking had <em>vamosed.</em> </p><p>Could Santa Claus be a thief? I hardly thought he, or any one else could be so parsimoniously acquisitive, as to steal that stocking. I strongly suspected one Bill W--- who camped just across the gulsh from me, but he always denied it. I thought he might have taken it in retaliation for a joke I played on him once. </p><p>He was not a very early riser, so one cold morning, noticing his old felt hat hanging on the peg outside the door, I quietly slipped over there, took the hat, and placed it over the top of the stove-pipe which stuck through the roof. While I was eating breakfast, I was much amused to see Bill, out getting kindling and starting his fire as he always did - in a hurry. I chuckled to myself as I thought how he would swear when he found his stove wouldn't draw; but there I was mistaken, for the top of the old hat was so full of holes, that the smoke passed out through with but little difficulty; and the heat passing up, soon burnt a hole just the size of the stove-pipe. </p><p>After breakfast, I saw Billy looking for his hat, to go out to work. He soon spied it with some three feet of stove-pipe run up through it. He climbed up and got it, put it on his head, lit his pipe, like a philosopher, shouldered his pick and shovel, and went to work. - That evening he mended his hat with a piece of an old boot-leg, and made it better than it was before. He always would persist in saying that I did the trick, and he may have taken the stocking in retaliation.</p><p>I wouldn't have cared, if it hadn't been my best one. It was mended and fixed up in true miner's style. A big double patch, cut out of an old flour sack, covered the place where the heel was worn out, and the big hole at the toe was all mended snug, by being puckered together, and a string tied round it. I think I should know it if I saw it again. </p><p>There are shooting matches to-day in various places, or rather they were were to be, but I think the rain must spoil their fun. Everybody's dinner table is set out with the best they can afford, and luscious turkeys, plenty of pie, and jolly great puddings, are the centre of attraction. Everybody wishes everybody &quot;a merry Christmas.&quot; </p><p>It has been raining hard, all day to-day as well as all last night, the worst rain we have had this season. The regular winter rains held off so, that we did not get to plowing so early by three or four weeks, as we did last year; but we have had considerable stormy weather lately, which has wet the ground well, and set the farmers to tearing up the face of the country at a fearful rate. All sorts of horses, fine stock, scrub stock, and mustangs, all come in play now. </p><p>There is a new style of &quot;gang-plow&quot; lately introduced, which is fast coming into general use, and seems to be a great saving of labor. It is got up and patented by a man in San Jose, and has taken the premium at all the fairs, both last year and this year. It consists of three ten inch plows set in a frame which runs on wheels. The plows are each made upon the end of a stout steel bar, which passes up through the frame, and by means of a cog-wheel arrangement, all three of the plows can be easily raised or lowered at pleasure, by the driver, who is mounted on a seat, which is fixed on the frame, for the purpose. With from four to six horses, one man with this plow can plow from four to six acres per day. It also has a seed-sower and harrow attached, so that the whole thing can be finished up at one operation. </p><p>The famous quicksilver mines of New Almada, a few miles from here, are to be reopened in about a week, and the hundreds of people who have been thrown out of employment by the injunction which has so long been resting upon this celebrated mine, will once more be actively employed. This long suspension of operation, has of course been of great injury to this State especially and detrimental to the general mining interests of the rest of the world. It is highly essential that these mines should be re-opened. </p><p>Commissioners are now selecting and negociating for a site in San Jose for ths depot, at that terminus of the San Francisco and San Jose railroad. The road is already commenced, and the cars running as far as Mirrin Doleres, and it will not be long before they will be running to San Jose. </p><p>This is one end of that great Pacific Railroad; that we Californians have so long prayed for, and intend to have.

Rockns18,"<p>No. XVIII </p><p>Dear Rock</p><p>The news from your side of Uncle Sam's ranch are of paramount importance, and most eagerly looked for and discussed by us of the Pacific just at the present time. Every time the Pony Express comes in, you should see what a deep and intense interest there is manifested by every one in the newly arrived intelligence from headquarters. </p><p>The North, South, East &amp; West are represented here, and of course sectionality of opinion does not fail to be manifested. Some of your pestilent East winds have blown a few loose seeds of treason, disunion, and secession and scattered them among us, but such seed finds very few spots on our fertile &amp; prolific soil, where it can get any root at all. In fact, although some of the seed may fall in some favorable localities, yet it will eventually be rooted out, same as other tares and weeds. </p><p>Ever since the adoption of the State Constitution in '49 there has been a certain political clique who have continually and notoriously directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of one grand design - the division of California into two parts, and the erection of a slave state from the Southern half of it. This was a splendid, and to them a highly desirable scheme but they couldn't make it win. This clique was composed of Southern men and they were of the Whig party while that party existed, but when Whiggery merged into know-nothing-ism, and finally stepped out altogether, they all threw a couple of flip-flaps and came up Democrats, or something similar.</p><p>Stockton was and is yet their headquarters, and their leader used to be the Hon Senator Henry A Crabb. They have contrived first and last by means of mutual assistance in the way of wire pulling and political chicanery to work into numerous influential and lucrative state, county, and municipal offices. They were the originators of, or helped to originate, the famous fillibusting expedition of Gen Wm Walker, when &quot;the gray eyed man of destiny&quot; tried so hard to be &quot;President&quot; of their slaveholding &quot;Republic of Lower California&quot; and [illegible] of Sonora. Neither of these dodoes could be made to work, so Crabb thinking he could do better, by going in person, went with a few dozen men on a wild, illy conceived, reckless expedition into Sonora, where instead of revolutionizing the country, they were taken prisoners almost as soon as they arrived, and Crabb and his companions were everyone shot. </p><p>The disastrous result of all their filibustering operations rather disheartened the clique, but of late the news from home have brightened their hopes, and they with others, composing the Southern pro-slavery element of our population, now advocate strongly a &quot;Pacific Confederacy.&quot; They say the Union is dissolved; the South has seperated from the North, and that we should follow the example of the gallant South, and repudiate all attachment to the odious North; in fact form a fine little Republic of our own, composed of Oregon, California, and some of the territory South of us that wouldn't make bad slave-states. They have even succeeded in poisoning the e- and mind of Gov Downey, until he nearly coincides with their views. But come to cipher the whole thing down, it amounts to this - The masses of the people are what rules the State, and they, the people, said on the 6th of November last, that California belongs to Freedom, and not to Slavery. The Union is not dissolved yet awhile, and even though the chivalry should take their state and their sable &quot;property,&quot; and <em>by permission, </em>have the glorious Union and the protection of the &quot;Star Spangled banner,&quot; together with some few of their cotton-headed neighbors, we can say to them &quot;depart in peace.&quot; Perhaps they know their own business best. Mr Gwin not long since said in the US Senate that in case of separation, &quot;California would go with the South,&quot; but since then, Mr Latham has told them that California would <em>not </em>go with the South, but would still remain with her sister free states in the same glorious old union as ever. Mr Latham is right. - But there is one natural and a strong band which would have done, and will still do more to preserve and perpetuate the Union than anything else and that is the Pacific Railroad. Our Senators and Representatives never have seemed to fully realize the vast importance of that one measure, or if they have, Southern intervention has always kept it in the background. Will they be able to do so much longer? </p><p>The long expected decision in the case of the United States vs the company claiming and working the New Almaden mine is at last rendered, and given in favor of the company, and the odious injunction which has rested upon it for the last two years is now dissolved, so that this celebrated mine, probably the best one in the whole world, is once more in full operation, and turning out great quantities of quicksilver, as of old. The fires were started on Saturday morning last, the 2nd inst. A grand feast was given by the proprietors, cannon were fired, and the festivities were kept up through Sunday. A general good effect is already perceivable in the fresh impetus given to business everywhere in the county. The case is appealed on both sides, to the US Supreme Court. On the part of the United States, not being satisfied with this decision of the lower court, and on the part of the Company, as not getting so much land confirmed to them, with the mine, as they think they are entitled to. </p><p>Adios, Ben Bolt </p>",public://rock/Rockns18.jpg
Rockns19,"<p>No. XIX.<br />Santa Clara Co Cal<br />Milpitas April 5<sup>th</sup>, 1861</p><p>Dear Rock</p><p>For some weeks past, nothing of special interest has transpired worth writing about. The farming community were busy putting in their crops, and the townspeople in their usual way traded, gossiped, dabbled in politics, drank whiskey, and discussed the weather. </p><p>The three first weeks of March we were favored with fine, warm clear spring weather ae the most fastidious could wish. The fruit trees bloomed, and leaved out, the green grasses grew at the rate of something less than a foot per day, heavenly hued flowers gently breathed their fragrant perfumes upon the balmy air, and the millions of gay little birds, merrily skipped about, trilling from their jolly little throats, tuneful praises on the beauties of Nature. On the 27th, however, there was a great change. A heavy south east storm with violent winds, followed by a deluge of rain, raged in full fury. During the after ­ noon and night of the 27th the rains just poured down, steadily, and without in - termission. When I first arrived in California I was struck with wonder at the singular depth of the ravines and water courses. Every little stream of water that in the fall would hardly suffice to quench the thirst of a stray dog, had a wide bed, and square, steep banks of the most unreasonable proportions. But after seeing a few specimens of the winter rains and floods, I wondered no longer. </p><p>On the 28th every ravine from the mountains on both sides of the valley were roaring and foaming with volumes of water and dashing in furious muddiness down towards the Guadalupe and the Coyote, the two creeks or rivers that run down through the valley, and empty into the head of San Francisco bay. The Guadalupe, was much swollen but the Coyote was much more so. In the afternoon the Coyote rose over its banks, and immdated the country for several miles on each side, down towards its mouth. It flooded across into the Guadalupe, and overflowed the town of Alviso, considerable damage was done to the crops by the sand and drift wood being deposited upon the fields. Fencing was taken away by the wholesale, and many hogs were drowned. But few cattle were lost, as they were got out of the way in time. A horse, saddled and bridled, came floating down. He was dead. Where he came from or who his rider was is not known. If the rider had not been drowned also, he should have been heard from by this time. Perhaps in trying to ford the stream, they were swept away. Many a man has thus been lost track of here in California, and never again heard from. No such overflow has been known since the winter of '52. During the night, as no more rain fell, the waters subsided and the next day, gradually resumed their former channel. The difficulties which have so long existed here in relation to Spanish land grants, instead of becoming settled have become more and more complicated. Very few of these claims have as yet been finally settled and disposed of, but nearly all are yet pending before the courts, in some shape or other. Very many of them are known to be fraudulent, and will eventually be proven to be so, but meanwhile, the law permits them to bring suit against the settlers upon them and eject them. The consequence is that the settlers in all parts of the Valley have been harassed by a set of thieving land grabbers. </p><p>They have been forced into lawsuits, their lands taken from them, the homes they have occupied and improved for years, broken up and destroyed, and they driven about until at last by degrees they have been forced to form themselves into a combination to resist any farther aggression on the part of these legal land-sharks. There, at Evergree, Mountain View, Gilroy, McCartysville, and several other points the settlers are organized into armed companies.</p><p>The settlers on the Chabolla (Chavoya) Grant some five or six miles from here, are at the present being con­siderably stirred up. This grant is known to be fraudulent, and is, like the others, still pending before the courts, but meanwhile the lawyers connected with it have brought suit, and procured a writ of ejectment against the settlers. A few days ago Deputy Sheriff Mclume, lawyer Matthews, and one or two others, rode out there from San Jose in a buggy, to serve the writ, and dispossess the settlers. They were met by a small armed party of those they came to eject, and ordered at the peril of their lives to go no farther. Their revolvers were taken from them, and they were escorted back to town, where their weapons were politely returned to them.</p><p>The sheriff of course, although thus resisted has his duty to perform, and has therefore for the last two or three days been busy summoning every one he can come across, to serve on a posse to assist him in executing the writ on Tuesday next, April 10th. He has already summoned a thousand or more, settlers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, bummers, grant holders, or anything else. The settlers are well prepared to resist and will be reinforced from all quarters in that day.</p><p>The sympathy of the people generally, is in their favor, and if there is any fighting done, the sheriff's adherents will get badly used up. But there will be no fighting, as nearly the whole of the posse which the Sheriff has summoned, is composed nescessarily of settlers and those who sympathize with them. This makes no difference however with the sheriff. He is obliged by law, to exhaust his powers in his own county first, and not being able otherwise to execute the writ, can then call on the Governor for assistance. </p><p>After the great battle has been fought, I will give you an account of it, together with a list of the killed, and wounded, and the number of scalps taken, that is to say if I am not killed too, for I intend to be &quot;thar.”</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT</p>",public://rock/Rockns19.jpg
Rockns20,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XX.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />May 20<sup>th</sup>, 1861.</p><p>DEAR ROCK: --</p><p>The difficulties which existed with the settlers on the Chabolla Grant, of which I wrote in my last, came to the culminating point on the 9th ult., and on that day a most bloodless battle was fought, in which the defendants became the assailants, and were victorious to a degree almost unparalleled in history.</p><p>At 10 A.M. the large posse which the sheriff had summoned to assist him in executing the writ of restitution against the settlers, appeared in front of the City Hall, San Jose, and answered to their names. It took over two hours to call the roll. The sheriff then asked them if they were armed and ready to go out and aid him in the performance of his duty. They all answered with a grand shout - No!! He then asked them if they would go and procure arms, and then follow him. Their reply was again a most unanimous - No!! &quot;Well,&quot; said the sheriff, &quot;I shall not go out alone, for as you all refuse to assist me, I can do nothing; therefore you may consider yourselves dismissed.&quot; The whole crowd at once quietly dispersed, and the majority of them went directly out to the Chabolla ranch, some six miles distant, whither your correspondent also emigrated, following the crowd, as he always does on all such occasions. </p><p>We soon arrived at the battle ground, and found the main body of the settlers drawn up in battle array, and resting upon their scalping knives, waiting the arrival of the sheriff and posse. The sheriff did not arrive, but the posse did, but being all good settlers, and falling into the ranks of the settlers army, their heads were not peeled. There were upwards of two thousand present. Several flags waved over the multitude, and every flag was alike - the glorious old &quot;Star Spangled Banner.&quot; Detachments of the settlers from a distance, had arrived the day before, camping on the battle field, and many companies travelled in the night, so as to be there in the morning. </p><p>All were armed, and weapons of all kinds were well represented. Rifles, from the long old Kentucky article, to the Sharp's patent. - Shot guns from the old fashioned &quot;king's arm,&quot; to the double barreled fowling piece. - Pistols, from the old flint-lock &quot;hoss pistle,&quot; to the Colt's revolver. Knives, bowie, stiletto, poniard, &quot;toad-stickers,&quot; and &quot;Arkinsaw tooth picks.&quot; Two small field pieces, six pounders, were drawn up in front, and an enterprising daguerrean artist from San Jose, was endeavoring to take a view of the whole scene, with his camera mounted on the roof of an omnibus. </p><p>It was concluded and agreed upon, that as no hostile persons had dared to appear from San Jose, it was advisable to just march the entire squatter army right through the streets of that devoted city, in order to reduce all adversely disposed persons to a proper state of submission, and show the swarming land sharks and thieving lawyers, what sort of men they had to deal with. Accordingly, at 1 o'clock P.M. the Squatters' grand march upon San Jose commenced. </p><p>Eighty big wagons and buggies led off. In the first wagon was a brass band. A top buggy followed, in which were Mr. Ballard and lady, Mrs. B. carrying a rifle across her arm, with a small American flag attached to the ramrod. - Next came two or three farm wagons filled with women and girls, some carrying guns. Then followed a four horse wagon full of men, and carrying a large American ensign on a pole about forty feet high. All carried more or less guns, and at intervals was borne the stars and stripes. There were some four hundred in the carriages. </p><p>Next came the cavalry, about a thousand strong, mounted on all sorts of horses, mules and jackasses, and led by Col. Hopper, mounted on a fine white mustang, and with a drawn sword in his hand. A harder looking crowd never passed through San Jose, than that regiment of mounted squatters, and being all covered with dust from head to foot, did not at all improve their personal appearance. As they wound round through the principal streets, they were cheered at various points by the citizens. </p><p>They marched at last to Washington Square, where the sheriff made them a short speech, to try and bring them to a realizing sense of what they were doing. They cheered every sentence he uttered, and gave him three times three at the conclusion. Col. Hopper then dismissed them, with a solemn adjuration to remember the occasion of their now being in arms in defence of their rights, their homes, and their firesides, against fraud, oppression, and wrong, and to be ready at all times to shoulder their guns and be on hand as they were on the present occasion; to which they responded most heartily, and then, after giving three jolly good groans for the land sharks in general, quietly dispersed. Thus ended the battle. No one was hurt, and not a scalp taken. </p><p>It was certainly very saucy in the squatters, thus marching defiantly through town right in the teeth and eyes of the law, but it had an excellent effect. The sheriff, having exhausted his powers in the county, made a requisition upon the Governor. Gov. Downey sent a commissioner to try and compromise the matter, but he couldn't do it. He then called upon the Legislature to make an appropriation of $100,000 to pay the expenses of calling out the military for the purpose of reducing these rebellious squatters to a proper state of subjection. The Legislature last week sent down a committee of three, to examine into the difficulty and report. </p><p>Meanwhile, however, the Chabolla lawyers, abandoning the trample-on and drive-out policy, have left no stone unturned to try and compromise the matter with the settlers, the more especially, as not only their grant was being held up to public inspection, but other grants equally fraudulent were liable to get ventilated also. They have just now at last effected a compromise, by which the case has gone to the supreme court on appeal, and the settlers have agreed to abide by the decision; so that lets sheriff, governor, legislature, military, squatters, lawyers, and all, out for the present. </p><p>May-day was, as usual, devoted to picnics, excursions, &amp;c. It was a delightful day, and was well improved by numerous parties, at various points. But the grand gathering of all was the big settler's pic-nic at McCartysville, some twenty miles from here. Of course the Bolt family was &quot;thar.&quot; It was held in a spacious and beautiful grove, and there were between two and three thousand people present. Pretty girls were in profusion. All good things were there. Everybody brought plenty, so there was enough to eat, and an ox was &quot;barbecued&quot; for those who are fond of that style of meat. The flag of our Union floated from various trees and poles. A big brass band played glorious music, a cannon brought by some of the boys, made the old woods, mountain, and valley, ring loud and patriotic echoes. Numerous good speakers mounted the rostrum, and talked felicitously to the multitude. Joy, jollity, and good feeling reigned supreme. It was certainly a magnificent affair, and on rather a larger scale than one generally sees such things done up. </p><p>Since the first of April, up to the present time, we have not had one drop of rain. It has been an unusually long and severe drought for this season of the year, and the grain crops which previously looked so luxuriantly promising, now are suffering much. In many localities, they have failed altogether, so that we shall have a rather short crop. To-night, as I am writing, we are having the only rain since April 1st - a good smart rain, which will help out the crops somewhat, but many crops are already &quot;gone in,&quot; past redemption. </p><p>Secessionism is decidedly and emphatically unpopular here. To be a secessionist, is to be despised by all decent, honest men. Union Mass meetings, are the order of the day, and Union poles, with the stars and stripes, are being erected everywhere. A splendid pole, over a hundred feet high, mounted by a big gilt eagle, was raised at the mission of San Jose on Saturday last. The American ensign which floats from its top, is forty feet long by twenty wide, and the whole cost $280, which was subscribed and paid in by some of the citizens, at a few minutes notice. </p><p>Politics hangs upon the issue - for or against the Union. No secessionist can be chosen to office in the State hereafter. California has always been misrepresented at Washington. &quot;Old Gwin&quot; had the effrontery once to state in the U.S. Senate, that &quot;in case of a dissolution or division of the Union, California would go with the South,&quot; and Mr. Senator Latham not long ago said in one of his speeches before the Senate, that &quot;should the North and South seperate, California would remain neutral, and at any rate would never fight against her sisters of the South.&quot; </p><p>We will show the world that Mr. Latham slandered us, if Old Uncle Andrew Jackson Lincoln should happen to call on California for a regiment of fighting men. California volunteers are plenty enough now, but will be plentier if wanted. </p><p>On the morning of the day of the grand settlers demonstration at San Jose, of which I have been writing, a secession flag was found floating from the tall flag staff in front of one of the engine houses. It had been put there some time during the night, and was made fast to the end of the halyards and run up to the truck so that it could not be hauled down. The news spread like wildfire, and a large and highly excited crowd of firemen and others were soon assembled. They came near cutting down the pole at first, and would undoubtedly have done so, had not a few of the cooler heads quietly sent down the topmast of the pole. As soon as the abominable rag was got rid of, the stars and stripes were run up amid wild and enthusiastic cheering. The secession flag was white, with a bear and a lone star painted upon it. As soon as the boys got hold of it, they tore it to shreds, and had the perpetrator of this outrageous insult been found out, they would have run him up to where he hoisted his insulting flag, just as sure as fate. Such is the popular feeling, and this little incident goes to illustrate the old saying of &quot;straws show which way the wind blows.&quot; </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns20.jpg
Rockns21,"<p>Correspondence.</p><p>No. XXI.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />Aug 1<sup>st</sup>, 1861.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK: - </p><p>And now again is harvest - the busiest time of the year with us of the farming community. No one has any excuse for being idle now but all the stragglers that come along, find plenty of work in the harvest field, and at wages of from $1.50 to $2.00 per day. As I predicted in my last, the long drouth we had in the spring had the effect to materially shorten the crops, so that we shall not have so much grain as last year, by one third. The war has its depressing effect on us, as well as with you, but not perhaps to so great a degree. It most direct effect on farmers is the rise in the price of grain sacks, which are four or five dollars per hundred, higher than they were last year. The cost of sacks is quite an item in harvest time, especially in a common crop of a thousand sacks or more. </p><p>Near here, in a large field, is &quot;Leland's harvester&quot; at work. It is quite a curiosity even with us, and it would make your old &quot;down east&quot; farmers open their eyes I know. It is a large threshing machine drawn by twenty horses. In front, and low enough to cut off the heads of the grain, is a cutting arrangement, which can be raised or lowered at pleasure, according to the height of the grain. It cuts a very even swarth of twelve feet in width, taking off all the heads of the grain, which pass directly into the threshing machine. The chaff blows out behind, and the clean grain runs out from a spout in the side, into the sacks which are hung on to receive it. A man rides on a platform to tend the sacks and sew them up as fast as they are filled. He then dumps them off behind, and they are left scattered all over the field. The horses go at a common walking gait, two abreast, and are driven by five drivers, each driving four horses, and riding in the saddle, postillion fashion.</p><p>&quot;Old Leland&quot; himself rides perched up on top of the machine like a pilot on a river steamer, to see th.at the whole concern navigates right. He carries a long pole in his hands, with which he reaches down and clears the cutting apparatus, in case it gets choked by mustard stalks or other trash. This machine is a large, unwieldy concern, and would not do so well in small fields as in large ones, as the stir and bustle in turning corners, reminds one forcibly of &quot;tacking ship.&quot; This machine was got up by Leland some three or four years ago, but has not done very good work until this season. </p><p>The fruit crop this year is first-rate, and there being more and more trees in bearing every season, fruit is very abundant and very cheap. Peaches are fast ripening and even now, they are flooding the market and can be bought in San Francisco as low as 50 cents per basket of about 30 lbs. Pears, apples, &amp;c., are also fast coming in, and the trees are all overloaded. </p><p>The San Francisco and San Jose railroad is being radidly pushed forward, and the screaming locomotive will soon be rattling through this beautiful valley. This is another link in the great Overland Railroad which we have so long talked of, and sooner or later must <em>have</em>. We Californians appreciate the necessity of this great work just at the present time, much more than you do. True, we have a daily Overland mail, and a Pony Express, and the telegraph from both sides of the continent is reaching far out, and the ends of it are rapidly approaching each other. Very soon we shall be enabled to hear of battles fought in the &quot;sunny South&quot; about as soon as you can know of it. But although we can thus have great facilities for communicating mentally, yet that will not suffice. We want to be able to receive a telegram from the resident, calling for a regiment or so of troops, and within a week personally report ourselves to “Uncle Abe,” ready for duty. We have a regiment already formed, and waiting to be called for, but they will have to take the old sea route, round about by Panama, instead of being whirled directly across the country by the express train. </p><p>As I have said in my former letters, secessionism is at a discount here. California will be loyal and true to the Union. </p><p>It is true we have many traitors among us, who are bold enough to even publicly proclaim their sentiments, but yet we are able to control all such with an iron hand, and give our sister States help to put down the rebels in their midst. The secessionists among us number about fifteen thousand, and perhaps more, but they are pretty well aware of the inexpediency of any rebellious demonstration on their part.</p><p>On the 4th of July, as an offset to the general Union celebrations of the day, the secessionists of San Jose got up a small private pic-nic away out one side by themselves, where it is to be presumed they talked treason, and murdered the government to their heart's content. </p><p>They were even bold enough to say that they should raise the secession flag on the occasion, but fortunately for them, they didn't do <em>that. </em>I know of many who watched or the appearance of that traitorous rag. </p><p>Had they hoisted it, then pic-nic would have ended in a row, and some one might have got hurt. But they did not <em>dare </em>to carry out their threats. Should the secessionists here in this State rise in arms and make any sort of a demonstration against the government, I hardly know where it would end but understanding the excitable elements of the California population as well as I do, I believe they would be utterly exterminated. All who were taken alive would be treated to a bit of rope, with a slip noose in the end, after the old style here. </p><p>To be known as a secessionist, is to be looked upon with distrust and suspicion, almost amounting to hate. One day a short time ago I was at the blacksmith shop, some three miles below here, and while there my horse got loose, and &quot;seceded&quot; for home, with the saddle, leaving me to &quot;foot it&quot; if I chose. As good luck would have it, an old farmer came along in a wagon, and I got a chance to ride with him. We had not gone far, before he turned, and looking me square in the face, said - &quot;Wal stranger, before we go any further, I'm jest a gwine ter know yer politics; are ye a Union, or a secesher? If yer a Union, yer all right, but if yer a secesher, jest git out of ther waggin, for I'll jest be dog on, if yer kin ride with <em>me</em>.&quot; </p><p>I told him I hailed from old Plymouth, was born of a Union mother, and brought up by a Union father; that my whole family were sound on the Union, and were I not for the Union too, I should certainly be a shame to the Bolt family, and to the old ship that brought me to the country.</p><p>&quot;Hooray for you,&quot; said the old fellow, &quot;give us yer hand,<em> you</em> kin ride with me, <em>you</em> kin. I'm from old Pike, I am. I don't like a secesher, and ef ever I find I'm in company with one, I jest naterally get shet of him, as soon as possible, you kin bet yer ribs on that. But <em>you’re</em> all right. You're too peert lookin a chap, to be anything but a Union.&quot; I acknowledged the altitude of the compliment, and found the old fellow jolly good company during our short ride, and when I left him, thanking him for his kindness, he said I was &quot;right welcome,&quot; and he was only sorry that our ride hadn’t been a heap longer. But,</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns21.jpg
Rockns22,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />Oct. 12<sup>th</sup>, 1861.</p><p>FRIEND ROCK:--</p><p>You have probably ere this, learned by the papers, the glorious result of our late election here in California. Secessionism received on that remarkable 4th of September, a rebuke as signal and decided, as it was unexpected, not only by the traitorous portion of our community, but Union men themselves hardly anticipated such a grand victory. </p><p>Just before the election, the feelings of all parties were wrought up to quite a state of excitement. Three parties were in the field, Republican, Union, and Secession. The Pony Express, and telegraphic wires, were every three or four days bringing us fresh and most stirring news from the seat of war; news I can assure you, that was most anxiously sought, especially by those who had relations, or friends engaged in the bloody strife. Military companies were being rapidly formed; recruiting stations were all around us, and the volunteers were fast collecting together in large camps of infantry and cavalry. The public sentiment, of course, seemed to be for the Union, but we well know that there were many who called themselves &quot;Union men,” but who were yet wavering, or were believed to be in reality &quot;wolves in sheep's clothing.&quot; </p><p>The extreme Southern Counties were also known to be of the secession order, and secessionism plainly seemed to be rapidly on the increase. Each man even began to mistrust his neighbor. Well we knew, that if the wrong man was elected Governor, and the traitors were to get command, civil war would be at once inaugurated in our Golden State; and those who knew the generally excitable nature of our population, might well believe that it would be a most violent, unhesitating, bloody, hand to hand contention, totally unlike the war in the South, which seems to us to be conducted with great circumspection, on scientific principles of great profundity, and thus far to consist mainly in the occupation of some big, comfortable forts, or in &quot;Big Bethel&quot; blunders, or in “Bull Run” fights. But we are looking daily for the Pony Express to bring us a better account of things.</p><p>A day or two preceding, and on the day of the election, the Republican and true Union men, began to form themselves into companies of Home Guard, in view of the fact that we knew not the real amount of the Secession element, and in fact we over estimated the strength of the enemy. The war spirit ran high. In the little precinct of Milpitas, which polls less than two hundred votes, a company of cavalry, one hundred strong, was enrolled in less than half a day; nearly all of them farmers. (Us among the number, of course.) But the glorious result of the election, showed that after all, the enemy was far weaker than we had any idea of, and so our farmer cavalry, with their plow-mules and scrub­mustangs, didn't need to turn out at all, and won't unless future troubles may arouse our military blood into a belligerent state. </p><p>What few secessionists there are about here, are very quiet and unassuming now, but in the extreme Southern counties they are so strong that they feel pretty saucy, and confident. The strong secession vote cast in that fine region of country, was probably what induced Gen. Sumner to immediately send those regiments of volunteers down among them, to enjoy their luxurious hospitalities. It was a capital good move. </p><p>Orders were received on the 4th inst., for the removal of the whole of the regular troops on this coast, with the exception of four companies of artillery, who will be retained to man our forts. They are ordered to Washington, and when they are collected in from Oregon, Washington Territory, and this State, they will amount to about 3000 men, considered by military judges to be the very flower of the U.S. regular troops. They are not needed here, as the volunteers can take their places; and these now amount to five regiments of infantry, and a regiment and a half of cavalry, making in all 6,500 volunteers under arms, well equipped in every respect, and from what I saw of them in the camps near San Francisco, a finer lot of men cannot be scared up in these United States. </p><p>As Californians, they are better adapted to camp usages and the viscissitudes of a soldier's life, than were the volunteer firemen and butcher boys of the East. It may be, that I have a sort of predilection in favor of the soldier boys of my adopted State, but some of them were former companions of mine in the mountains, where we mined, hunted, and passed through the many rough scenes of excitement and danger, incident to a miner's life, together, and from what I know of them, I have faith to believe that should they happen to be called upon to assist in quelling the rebellious chivalry of the &quot;sunny south,&quot; they will not be found wanting, and will render a good account of themselves. </p><p>But oh, it is indeed humiliating to the souls of true loyal Americans, to see and appreciate the present sad condition of our well beloved country. The glorious old Star Spangled Banner trampled in the dust, and the very existence of our motherly Union menaced by traitorous sons, whom when nursed, reared, and taught from infancy, and now grown to manhood, they disown their parent, and defiantly turn their traitorous swords upon the bosom of the mother who skilled them in the arts of war, fondly looking forward to the future when these, her brave sons, would ever stand ready to defend with their true hearts and swords, their mother's life and home. </p><p>Oh! Jackson, Webster, Clay, illustrious ruling spirits of the past. It was well that ye died while yet our country's flag waved proudly over the united and happy Republican sisterhood of States. When our proud eagle yet soared with undimmed eye, and not a feather was torn from his wing. When the royal nations of Europe were made to feel and respect the power of Young America, and were not as now, gleefully smiling at the failure of the great &quot;Republican Experiment;&quot; as they were pleased to term it. </p><p>But brave hearts and true hands, fight on. Rally all to the support of the Union and the Constitution. Rebellion must be crushed out, and traitors must be punished as traitors deserve. Those that cannot fight, must back up those that can fight. While our friends and brothers are manfully combatting the traitors on the battle fields of the South, let us keep down treason and traitors in our midst. We have traitors of the meanest kind among us, who openly give aid and comfort to the enemy, both by means of speeches in public, and through the press. There are also those high in office; servants of the Government, who should be ever guarding the best interests of the Government, and seeking to make the burden of taxation as light as possible upon the people, but who are yet shamelessly directing all their energies to taking advantage of their official station during this unfortunate war, to make all the money they can, out of it, and fill their own greedy pocket. Let all those traitors and rogues be treated summarily as they deserve. </p><p>The Rev. Dr. Scott of Calvary Church, San Francisco, has always been a ''southern sympathizer,&quot; and for some time past has been rapidly gaining in unpopularity, from his secession sentiments being more and more boldly expressed. All the other churches in the city had poles raised upon them, and so on Sundays display the Stars and Stripes; but he refused to allow the flag to be raised on his church, and a short time ago he expressed some of his traitorous views in print, and from the pulpit declared among other sentiments of the like order, that in his opinion &quot;Jeff Davis is no more of a traitor than was George Washington.&quot; </p><p>Now this was piling it on rather heavier than the people like it, and so they concluded to put a stop to it. Accordingly on Sunday, the 22d ult., when the Rev. Dr. came to church he found the Stars and Stripes floating from various parts of the building, and on the opposite side of the street, hung by the neck an effigy, labeled &quot;Dr. Scott the reverend traitor.&quot; A large and excited crowd was also gathered in front of the church, and a strong body of police were on hand, who principally by persuasion succeeded in removing the effigy.</p><p>By 10 o'clock there was nearly 3000 people in the street but they were rather orderly, and with the exception of some few little incidents nothing remarkable was done. When the Rev. Doctor arrived, no one attempted to impede his progress, although some few groaned and hooted at him, but as soon as he had passed into the church, the crowd rushed in, and at once filled the building in every part, and the throng in front was very dense. He proceeded with the services, in his customary manner, but was very guarded, and avoided giving offence, and it was indeed well that he did, for although the entire police force of the city were there, they could hot have saved him from the fury of the people. </p><p>After services, the Doctor accompanied by his daughter, rode home in a carriage which was in waiting - the police keeping the crowd back. As the carriage drove off, some of the crowd gave groans for Dr. Scott, whereupon the Doctor's son William about 18 years of age, made himself kown, and talked very violent and showed a revolver. Of course there was a rush, and the young man would have been most summarily dealt with, had not the police rushed him off immediately to the Station house, where they kept him till the crowd dispersed, when they took him safely home. </p><p>Dr. Scott sent in his resignation next day to the church, which was however anticipated by his dismissal, and he left in a few days afterwards for Europe, having sold out his property and all his interest in such a very intolerant city as San Francisco. </p><p>The State and County Fairs are all over now, and were characterized by but little out of the common course of such things. Plenty of the finest stock of horses and cattle were there, and the vegetable department exhibited a grand collection of immense pumpkins, mammoth cabbages, unreasonable beets, huge turnips, &amp;c., and such a collection of fruit, that for beauty and size, can only be found in California. </p><p>At the State Fair, one Tom Rooney under took to ride horseback; 210 miles in ten hours, on the Yolo Grove Course. He rode 132 miles and quit. At the time of quitting, he had gained seven miles over 21 miles an hour. - The reason why he quit, is said to be because he had not enough horses - having only seventeen ­ and that he drank rather too much whiskey. Most of those who were present, seemed to think he could have accomplished the feat, if he had enough horses, and used more discretion in his drinking of liquor. Don Ramon Pice - a Californian - on-the San Jose course last year, rode 150 miles in six hours and seventeen minutes. But</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns22.jpg
Rockns23,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXIII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />Feb. 8<sup>th</sup>, 1861.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>I have deferred writing to you for some time past, owing to the long continuation of the storms and floods which have been so heavily visited upon Uncle Sam's Pacific possessions, rendering traveling an arduous undertaking, and mail facilities extremely dubious and unreliable. And then again, my last letter to you, although it was written in due season, I find never reached you, for the very good reason that it was not mailed at all. A friend of mine, who was going to Washoe, kindly volunteered to mail the letter for me, at San Francisco; but he unfortunately forgot all about it until a few days ago, when he returned. He found the letter among his baggage, where he had mislaid it, and it had remained safely stowed away ever since. He thought it might be getting stale, so he returned it to me. </p><p>This winter thus far has been the most severe that has yet been experienced, since the first settlement of the country. The &quot;oldest inhabitant&quot; never saw the like. It has indeed been - <em>the</em> “rainy season,&quot; for up to the present time, it has been rain, rain, with but little intermission, thicker and faster, and more and more of it. The first rain of the season fell on the 10th of November, but it did not get in a good deluging way until December, when all the little streams and creeks became swollen, and on the 9th of that month, commenced the first of a series of appallingly extensive floods. The big rivers ran over their banks, and overflowed the level plains, carrying ruin, death, and destruction everywhere. </p><p>The far-famed, but ill-fated city of Sacramento has suffered terribly. After the inundations of the memorable winter of '52-3, a high levee or embankment was built around the city, in order to protect it from all future floods, it answered very well for such fine winters as we have had since then, but this winter it could not fence out the big waters. - The raging floods of the American, and Sacramento, attacked the devoted city, both in the rear and in the front. Over the levee came the leaping waters, scornfully laughing at the puny obstructions that the presumptuous hand of man had placed in its way. The alarm bells sounded, and people rushed hither and thither to save what they could or to note the progress of the danger.</p><p>Along the level streets, and over the sidewalks, rushed the gliding demon of destruction, submerging street after street, until at last it had complete possession of the doomed city. Still and steadily rose the water over the curbstones, over the door steps, and into houses, stores, and hotels it rushed. Everybody was busy putting things up out of the way of the water. The pianos and sofas were set up on the chairs and tables, and all the light moveables were taken up stairs or put on high shelves. It rose at the rate of an inch in five minutes, and stood at the depth of rom two to six and seven feet on the lower floors. Many small wooden buildings floated off down stream, and some of the walls of the brick buildings, becoming gradually undermined by the action of the current, settled and fell. - Boats were out everywhere, rescuing those who were in danger. </p><p>At length the abating storm allowed the waters gradually to recede. Street after street reappeared and the luckless inhabitants began to please themselves up with the idea that the flood was over with, and all there was to do was to repair damages, and fix the levee so as to prevent any more floods from gaining admittance. But these comforting reflections were of short duration, for before the waters had entirely left the city, heavy rains sent a still heavier flood in upon them, which was quickly followed by another and still another. Week after week passed, and the repeatedly and continually submerged city presented scenes of distress, misery, and ruin, hard to realize. </p><p>Hundreds of families lost all they possessed in the world, and were thrown upon the charities of their fellow citizens, or crowded the steamers for San Francisco. </p><p>Many took refuge in the large building called the Pavilion, where they were fed and provided for by the Committees of Relief and Safety, Most of those who had taken refuge in the upper stories of their houses, were not prepared to stand such a long siege, and had to be removed, or relieved, by means of the boats which were plying to and fro through the streets for that purpose. Many were actually starving. Cooked food became a rarity; for the stoves and cooking-ranges were mostly under water. </p><p>The steamers to San Francisco come crowded with the unfortunates, who were given a free passage from their last homes, to where they could be fed and properly cared for by a generous and sympathizing public. Thousands upon thousands of dollars were at once subscribed and collected, and donations of provisions, clothing, blankets, and especially cooked food, promptly dispatched by steamer loads each day, to the relief of the suffering Sacramentans. In San Francisco, Platt’s Music Hall was, as well as other places, thrown open to receive the homeless sufferers, and thousands partook of its hospitalities. </p><p>Sacramento has been the Capital of this state for the last six of eight years, and you may be sure our legislators did not have a very jolly time of it during the flood, paddling about in all sorts of boats, to and from the waterlogged State House. They stood it quite patiently for a while, but at length came to the very sensible conclusion that it was best to adjourn to dry land; so therefore, now both houses meet, and are in session in San Francisco. The Capital will doubtless be removed after this, and be located in some more desirable locality­ San Jose, Oakland, probably. </p><p>Great destruction was also caused by the floods at Marysville and other places on the Sacramento and American. Mills, dams, bridges &amp;c. were swept away by the mighty force of the resistless current, and many lives were lost. The whole of the immense plains of the Valley presented to view one vast sheet of water. The ranches were all overflowed, and an immense loss of cattle, horses, sheep, and other live stock, was the consequence. It is calculated that over forty thousand head of cattle have perished thus far. The steamers from Sacramento brought down many hundred head of horses and cattle to San Francisco, and from the ranches on each side of the river the distressed farmers were taken from their houses, on board the steamer. Small relief boats also scoured the plains far and near in every direction, loaded with provisions for the relief or rescue of all who stood in need. </p><p>Stockton was also flooded, but suffered very little, compared with Sacramento. All throughout the mining region, the floods of the various rivers were beyond all precedent, and the loss of property in the way of mills, bridges, dams, flumes, and all sorts of mining arrangements, was immense. Many lives were also lost, and most all of the little towns along the rivers were swept away entirely. At Los Angelos much damage was done to the vineyards and orchards by the floods, and the loss of property throughout the state is estimated thus far, to be considerably over fifty millions of dollars. </p><p>Large quantities of provisions were destroyed in the mines, so that now, owing to the almost utter impossibility of transportation there, the necessaries of life are scarce and dear. In fact, within the last three or four weeks, provisions in San Francisco have advanced most materially in price. Flour is now ten dollars a barrel, potatoes three and four cents a pound, and all other things in proportion. As regards suffering, distress, hardship, and loss of property and life, this winter far exceeds the memorable winters of '49 and '52. As a matter of course, a much larger amount of snow has fallen in the Sierra Nevada than has been before known of, which will give a chance for some heavy spring freshets.</p><p>On the other side of the Sierra, also, in the Carson Valley, Meono, Esmeralda, and. Washoe counties, the damage has been very great indeed, especially at Washoe. A great many of the mining mills there have been swept away, and several lives lost. In the past week the weather has been tolerably good; the floods have subsided, and Sacramento is now probably nearly free from the water, again. What sort of weather is yet in store for us, of course remains to be seen. </p><p>Thus far, the farming community have had a hard time of it, as well as the rest of the population. Very little plowing has been done, and what was done in the first part of the winter, has become so packed and washed by the heavy rains, that it will have to be done over again. So the prospect is that we shall have but a small crop put in this year, as there is but a very short time left to do it in. God save us from such another winter as this has been thus far. </p><p>This next spring and summer there will be a great rush made for the new gold mines of the Nez Perces and the Salmon, in Oregon, and the Cariboo, in the British possessions. - There mines were discovered last fall, and are said to be fabulously rich. There is much excitement about them, and next summer, when they can be worked, you will hear wonders from them, in the way of large fortunes, huge lumps, and big strikes, - probably.</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns23.jpg
Rockns24,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXIV. <br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal., <br />May 13<sup>th</sup>, 1962.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>As I predicted in my last letter, there is a great rush now being made for the newly discovered gold diggins away up in the cold North. From San Francisco they are departing by the ship load, and every day, more or less of the fortune hunters pass along the road at this point, bound for the land of promise. - They are all fitted out about alike; each riding one mule, and leading or diving another, packed with the necessary provisions and accoutrements for their long journey. </p><p>They will pass up through the Northern part of this State, to Oregon, and into the famous mines of the Salmon river, and if they don't find gold enough there to satisfy their ideas of boundless wealth, they will go on through Washington territory and into the far-famed gold regions of “Cariboo,” in British Columbia, where the precious metal is now believed by the enthusiastic herd, to lie about loose, in endless profusion. This is only the commencement of the work, and if it only holds out as well as it has begun, California will soon have no floating population at all. You never saw the like. </p><p>The gold mines in Oregon have been worked for several years, but although the Salmon river was known to have good mines upon it, yet the Indians were very brave and very troublesome. Indeed, they would not allow those mines to be worked at all if they could help it. But last fall a few strong parties of adventurous spirits got into the coveted region, and found the diggins to be of the very richest description. The winter snows soon drove them out, but they brought away considerable gold, and the most extravagant stories of the fabulous wealth of the new placers. </p><p>You recollect the big stories that were told in 1849, about the golden wealth of California, and of the sudden fortunes to be easily acquired here. Almost incredible stories were told, but in many cases, they were indeed true. The same wild stories are now being told about these newly discovered mines and indeed they may also turn out to be true. One thing is certain and sure; if gold is there in any quantity worth fighting for, the bravest lot of Indians in creation couldn't prevent the mines from being worked, and these poor redskins will just naturally have to stand back, or be exterminated. </p><p>Gold, and glittering wealth, dazzles and blinds the eyes of all the swarming fortune hunters, and the rights of the red-man are not to be considered, but pitilessly trampled beneath the onward rushing footsteps of the civilization embodied in the rush for gold. But so it has been, and so it will ever be; men will rush in crowds pell mell, wherever the deceitful finger of Fortune may beckon them; each eagerly striving, and hoping to be of the few favored ones who may bask in the golden smiles of the fickle Goddess, and although they return from the race, broken down, and weary with disappointment, they still remain as ready to start out on just such another golden humbug. </p><p>In January 1851, a great excitement broke out about some very rich gold mines said to be just discovered on the ocean beach at what is now known as Gold Bluff, some 275 miles northward from San Francisco. Wildly exaggerated falsehoods were told, and were contained in the daily papers of the marvelous wealth there waiting the hand of the gold hunter, and in less than three days, there were eight vessels advertised to sail for Gold Bluff. Fortunately however, the bubble burst in a few days, so soon in fact, that but few got started for the new El Dorado. </p><p>The gold was said to lie in patches of black sand on the sea beach, where it had been deposited by the action of the surf, and this sand was represented to be so rich with small scales of gold, as to yield from one to three dollars to the pound. In short, it was literally yellow with the precious metal. Now although this was a terrible big humbug, yet it was not altogether a lie, for there really was much gold to be found in the sand of the beach, and many miners have done well since that time, in washing for it. The bluffs along the beach are of the same material as the auriferous hills in other parts of the gold region, and a natural washing has been going on for thousands of years, resulting in a deposit of gold being left among the sands of the beach, while the loamy soil being lighter, is carried off by the surf. </p><p>''Gold Lake,&quot; was another humbug, - a real one, and no mistake. This was gotten up I think in the spring of '52, and the story as I heard it, was thus: In the fall of '51 an old fellow by the name of Hopkins - an old mountaineer - appeared in Placerville, and told wonderful stories of recent adventures in the as yet unexplored parts of the Sierra Nevada. He told of discoveries of gold that he had made in numerous places, and by and by, when the minds of this eager popu­lation had become prepared he quietly and by cautious degrees, proceeded to unfold a golden tale. </p><p>He told how that in the course of his wandering explorations far back in the snowy Sierra, he one day found himself in a most beautiful valley of some six or eight miles in length, by a mile or two in width, situated deep down among the tallest, steepest, and roughest mountains imaginable. About midway of the valley, was a clear beautiful lake, which extended its placid waters over about half the bottom of the valley, and from the well wooded ravines on every side, the mountain streamlets dashed merrily down, and were lost in the calm bosom of this lovely lake. A fine stream was the outlet, which at the lower end of the valley went tumbling and foaming far down into a dark rocky canon. </p><p>The shores of this beautiful lake were a fine white sand, bordered to the foot of the mountains all around, by a rich pasture of green grass and clover, studded with splendid flowers of every hue, and numerous herds of fat deer quietly grazed there, utterly unconscious of danger; never before probably, having seen their mountain solitude intruded upon by man. According to his story, it must have been a perfect paradise. </p><p>But to his open-eared auditors, the most interesting part was where he went on to say that while in the act of drinking from one of the clear mountain streamlets which ran into the Lake, he discovered in a washed crevice of the <em>bed-rock</em>, a piece of gold nearly the size of a musket ball. Of course he at once proceeded to explore the bed of the stream, and wherever the force of the water had washed the bed-rock bare he found in the crevices &quot;many a fine little nugget;&quot; &quot;from the size of a wheat grain to that of a hickory nut;&quot; Before night he had picked up two or three pounds of the precious metal, and all of it coarse. All the ravines he found to be equally as rich.</p><p>The fine gold had all washed down and was deposited on the shores of the lake in great abundance. He estimated that a man with the ordinary appliances for separating the gold from the earth, could easily wash out from 3 to 4 lbs of gold a day. </p><p>Early the next spring, he had organized a company of forty men from each of whom he received one hundred dollars, in consideration of which, he was to conduct them through the mountain defiles, and over the rocks and across the snows, until at last he should being them safely to the lovely valley of the Golden Lake. Each man lead a mule, packed with the necessary tools, grub, blankets, &amp;c., and stealthily they took their departure by night from Placerville, in order that no one might follow them on the sly, and get the benefit of the new discovery, without paying their regular hundred dollars. Up the rocky steeps they toiled, and down the rocky steeps they struggled, and along the ridges and through the deep ravines they led their toilsome march, but night brought them that sweet refreshing sleep, so peculiar to the prospecting miner, and in their mid-night dreams they wandered rich and happy along the enchanting shores of Gold Lake. </p><p>The next day they pursued their weary journey, ever and anon stopping to &quot;prospect&quot; some promising looking locality, and during their three days journey they discovered gold in several places which were afterwards worked, and turned out rich, and even now are among the best diggins in the country. The third day however they began to be rather discontented, as “Old Hopkins&quot; seemed very uncertain as to the route to, and the locality of, the Gold Lake, and before night they even began to suspect that the old rascal was leading them out to try and discover rich gold mines, in the region where they thought they might exist, and the Gold Lake story was only a bait to lead them on. Indeed the propriety of hanging &quot;Old Hopkins&quot; in case he should not find Gold Lake next day, was freely discussed. In fact it is supposed that Hopkins himself began to think best to &quot;shab out,&quot; as things began to assume rather of a squally aspect towards himself, for sometime during the night, he did evacuate the premises. </p><p>The next morning, when the poor dupes found he had &quot;vamosed,&quot; nothing could exceed their rage. Gold Lake was forgotten at once. Revolvers were brandished, big oaths were ripped out, and all hands rushed in different direction, keen on the search for Old Hopkins. 0! that terrible old scamp; if he had been so unfortunate as to have been caught about that time, they would have massacred him at once, and fed his carcass out in inch pieces to the Coyotes. But old Hopkins was not caught, and never has been heard of since. Thus ended that expedition. The story, however, had gone forth, and thousands were yet in the delusive belief that the Gold Lake did exist, and many other parties from time to time, explored in the vain hope of finding it; but it has never been found yet. </p><p>Frazer river was a humbug to a certain extent only, for gold was indeed there, and there were those who made fortunes at mining, but the mines were not by any means so rich as was reported, or so extensive, and they never have offered such inducements for adventurers, since the first rush. </p><p>As for these new mines now discovered, if they are only one-tenth as rich as the marvellous reports from there state them to be, they are rich enough, plenty; but the pioneers, there, as well as in all new countries, will have to clear away all the difficulties and smooth the way for those who come after them; so I think if we want to go to Salmon or to Cariboo, it will do in a year from now, much better than at present. They will have the thickest of the Indians killed off too, by that time. So much for gold mining. </p><p>It has become very customary of late among us here, to exchange remarks in reference to the weather, and to mutually speculate as to what the crops are likely to be, and how they are going to stand affected. After the heavy fit violent rains of winter had ceased, a spell of dry, hot weather, suddenly set in, which lasted three weeks, and presented a remarkable contrast to the deluging rains; but now again we are as suddenly receiving an instalment of showery, cold, blustery, and disagreeable weather. It seems more like March than like May. The crops look pretty well, but it is extremely difficult to foretell just now, how they will turn out. The early sown grain has grown so tall and rank, that during the past few days it has been falling down very extensively, and as there is plenty of chance for all the early grain to be lost in that way, we may not have such an abundant harvest, after all, as grain that lodges, or falls, while it is yet green, will not fill out, but has to be cut for hay.</p><p>May day was pretty generally observed; picnics were the order of the day everywhere and the many balls in the evening, were very fully attended.</p><p>The great institution, the telegraph, possesses no ordinary degree of interest at present, and we are more than ever anxious to get the latest news from the seat of war. You can hardly imagine how like wildfire any news of importance spreads over the State. The wires which traverse the country in all directions and to the farthermost corners, flash the news to all parts as soon as received, and the express being but a short distance behind the telegraph, the newspaper extras follow with the particulars, so that everybody is kept pretty well posted in regard to the news. It would have done your loyal soul good to have been here and seen the effect that the news of the great victory at Pittsburg Landing had upon all classes of the people. Everybody looked jolly, notwithstanding the news was so badly exaggerated as to make it that the loss of life amounted to fifty thousand men. </p><p>In San Francisco the joyful excitement seemed greatest. It was in the evening that the news came over the wires, and at Platt's Music Hall, the Oratorio of the Creation was being performed to a crowded house. At the conclusion of the first act, Senator Shafter appeared upon the stage, and in a neat speech, announced the glorious news. </p><p>The effect was electric. The vast audience arose as one man, and such tremendous cheers burst forth, as were hardly ever before heard within the walls of a theatre. Men acted as though they were crazy. The hundreds of singers threw their books down on the stage, and danced for joy. The old pot-bellied codger that did the bass viol, swung his big bow over his head, and yelled like a demon, while men in the boxes and pit, threw up their hats, jumping and shouting for joy, and the ladies swung and waved their handkerchiefs most vigorously. The band struck up Yankee Doodle, Hail Columbia, and the Star Spangled Banner, which materially assisted to heighten the excitement. It was some time before the Oratorio could be proceeded with. But -</p><p>Adios, BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns24.jpg
Rockns25,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXV.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />Aug. 9<sup>th</sup>, 1862.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Harvest is again with us, and the agricultural portion of the community, as usual at this season, finds plenty to do. Wages for harvest hands are from two to three dollars per day, and in fact there is more work to do than there is hands to do it, so many are off to the wars, or gone to the new mines of the far North. Of these last however, large numbers are returning now, heartily sick of their journey, and glad enough to get back to our hospitable shores once more. </p><p>Ahl you should hear the doleful stories some of them tell, of the hardships and sufferings they encountered in their long and perilous trip by sea, river and land, to the cold, rough, and unfriendly regions of &quot;Salmon&quot; and “Cariboo,&quot; where the gold should have been as they expected to find it, but didn't - in great profusion. Some of them say there are a few claims there that are very rich, but they were taken up long ago, and all the country outside of just those few claims isn't worth staying in, to say nothing of mining it. Others say there is “a little&quot; gold there &quot;in spots,&quot; but not enough to pay anybody for digging for it. Others again pronounce the whole thing an unmitigated humbug, got up by the steamship companies, and others interested, just to swindle, rob and cheat a too confiding public. </p><p>And then you should hear them tell about the snow, ice, and cold water they met with, frozen toes, scarcity of grub, cross Indians, and all that sort of thing. I'm glad we didn't go. One thing we may depend upon, those who were victimized on this occasion, feel that they have learned wisdom from experience, and will not be humbugged again very soon; at least not until some other gold excitement of the same kind is gotten up, when they will again go into it with the same rush as before. &quot;<em>Sic transit gloria mundi.</em>&quot; One philosopher however, assures me that he &quot;only went up there because the rest did - wanted to see the country - didn't expect to find anything there,&quot; and winds up by saying - &quot;Blessed are they who don't expect anything, for they shan't be disappointed.”</p><p>Notwithstanding the difficulties we labored under this last winter putting in our crops, the harvest is very abundant, and we have plenty to spare. I think as much, or nearly as much wheat was raised this year, as in any year previous, and the prices therefore rule low. Fruit is also plenty and cheap. </p><p>Although so far removed from the scenes of war, bloodshed, and devastation consequent upon the present rebellion, yet we cannot but feel the consequences of it. Many a familiar face has disappeared from among us, &quot;gone to the wars,&quot; and the enhanced prices of the various articles of domestic necessity, together with the increased rates of taxation, tell strongly upon the resources of us all. But where is the true loyal patriot who will not cheerfully stand five times the draught upon his resources, aye, give his last dollar, if necessary, towards the support of such a government as ours. If he isn't able to fight, himself, let him help support those who will fight for him. </p><p>Of course much complaint is made in certain quarters, at the &quot;oppressive taxation,&quot; as they term it. I notice that those who have the least to pay, are about as loud in their outcries as any of us. There are many known secessionists here, as well as many of those who sympathize with the South, but yet don't dare to come out honestly and openly, and acknowledge themselves to be secessionists. And to those, of course, it is like drawing teeth, to be obliged to contribute to the support of a government they would like to see overthrown, and at one time some of them talked quite strongly of resisting the collection of their part of the taxes. I am inclined to think they would have had a jolly time of it. They are all pretty quiet now, and don't talk half so saucy as they did a year ago. They are liable to learn, sooner or later, that we have a government yet that is ready, willing, and able, to reduce all rebel traitors to a proper state of submission. </p><p>You probably have ere this, read the full account of the loss of the steamship Golden Gate, which left San Francisco for Panama on the 21st of July, with 242 passengers, and 96 crew, and was burned on the 27th, 15 miles Northwest of Manzanilla. Of the 338 souls on board, 198 are lost or missing. The fire broke out near the engines, while the passengers were at dinner, and so rapid was the progress of the flames, that but little could be done towards saving the ship.</p><p>She was headed at once for the shore, which was some three miles distant, and soon struck, - but by this time the entire ship was enveloped in flames, and all who were not in the boats, had to take to the water. Many succeeded in reaching the shore, but many more were drowned in the heavy surf, or perished near the ship. </p><p>The helmsman heroically stood at his post, until the scorching flames completely encircled him, then lashed the wheel and sprang through the fire into the ocean. He was saved. </p><p>There was no such thing as remaining by the ship. The rushing flames bounded fiercely fore and aft, and unrelentingly hurried every living soul over into the sea. In the opinion of some of the passengers, thirty minutes could not have elapsed from the time the alarm was first given until the ship was entirely abandoned. She struck some two or three hundred yards from the shore. </p><p>The next day after the disaster, the steamship <em>St. Louis</em>, from Panama, arrived, and took on board all who were on the shore, or who had reached Manzanilla, and brought them up to San Francisco. Several very young children were saved; one, a sweet little babe of about two months was washed ashore, its parents being drowned. Three children by the name of Manchester, the eldest eight and the youngest three years of age, were also saved. </p><p>The treasure, amounting to about a million and a half, of course still remains with the wreck. An expedition has already left San Francisco to attempt the recovery of it. </p><p>This makes the seventh steamship that has been lost on this route within the last twelve years. The <em>North America</em> was lost on the 27th of February, 1852, forty miles south of Acapulcy; passengers and crew all saved. - The <em>Independence </em>was burned at Margarita Island, Lower California, the 16th of February, 1853. Nearly 200 persons lost their lives. - The <em>S.S. Lewis</em> was wrecked at Bolinas Bay, some fifteen miles north of San Francisco, on the 9th of April, 1853, no lives being lost. - The <em>Tennessee</em> was wrecked at the entrance of the bay of San Francisco on the 6th of March, 1854, but all on board were saved. The <em>Winfield Scott</em> was wrecked off Santa Barbara, Dec. 2nd, 1853. No lives were lost. But with the <em>Yankee Blade</em>, off the same coast, Oct. 1st, 1854, 415 souls went down.</p><p>The <em>Golden Gate</em> was built in 1851, and has been considered to be one of the best boats on the route. The origin and cause of the fire is not precisely known, and no blame as yet seems to be attached to any one, but the fire seems to have been one of those accidents that foresight could not well guard against. </p><p>Us Californians feel much rejoiced to see that at best we are to have what we have so long desired, the great Pacific Railroad. It certainly cannot but be of the most inestimable benefit to our whole country, opening out as it will, the partially developed rich resources of the vast interior, and establishing a mode of communication between the two sides of our continent, the want of which has been, and is, seriously felt. The railroad, although much faster, may not be a much safer mode of transit than the steamship line, but then many people prefer having their necks satisfactorily broken on land, to being burnt, scalded, or drowned, by the ocean route. </p><p>But our country is progressing, rebellions and wars notwithstanding. Old fogies are dying out, and youthful embodiments of progress are filling their places. The world rolls forward, not backward. The progressive representatives of the age are being “married and given in marriage,&quot; and in this connection I wish to inform you that I was “taken down” several pegs one day last week, by a visit from our mutual friend Fred. W. Lucas, Esq., one whom I have ever been proud to own as a friend, and fellow Plymothean, and what do you think? -by his side in the buggy he had a nice young lady, whom he introduced to me as <em>Mrs. Lucas</em>. A fine, bright-eyed importation just arrived direct from old Plymouth. - They only stopped a few minutes. They were en route for Lucas' ranch on the Salinas, some fifty miles from here. To say he took me by surprise, would only convey a faint idea of the disturbance of my usual equanimity. </p><p>This is the result of confidential correspondence and secret conspiracy between Lucas and parties interested at home. Oh, so sly was he, and so quietly did he consummate the whole plot, that his most intimate friends here didn't know a thing about it till it was too late to argue the case with him. </p><p>Well, after all perhaps it wasn't quite so bad a move on his part when one comes to be reconciled to it. Good, smart, desirable girls are not as plenty as black berries here. It was a good idea after all. All happiness to them. I like it. It set me to thinking. But –</p><p>Adios.

Rockns26,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXVI.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Nov. 10, 1862.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>Since my last letter, I have been travelling about a little, and perhaps you may not find a leaf or so from my journal uninteresting. First, in company with my friend A. W. Harris, Esq., I took a trip down to Fred Lucas' ranche, near the Salimas river, some sixty miles south of here. We rode in a comfortable buggy behind a span of dashing roadsters, but the day being hot and sultry and the road very dusty, we only drove to Watsonville, - some fifty miles, - the first day. </p><p>In crossing the coast range of mountains, which separates Santa Clara valley from Pajaro valley, our road was a fine turnpike, winding around the steep hill-sides, across deep ravines, and up through the mountain gorges, among noble oaks and tall pines and cedars, interspersed with smaller trees and beautiful shrubbery in endless profusion, while at convenient distances along the toilsome ascent, springs of clear, cool, sweet mountain water gushed forth most refreshingly for both man and beast. Arrived at the summit, a most magnificent panorama presented itself to our view. The great bay of Monterey was before us, stretching far out and mingling with the broad blue waters of the Pacific ocean, with the distant horizon shrouded in heavy banks of fog. </p><p>Below us, at the foot of the mountain range, lay the beautiful valley of the Pajaro, with its fertile fields and shady groves, the numerous fences crossing each other, dividing the rich land into broad, square fields, some like a checker­board on a large scale. Most of the fields of grain were already harvested, but many of the pasture fields were yet green, owing to being low ground, and then again the heavy fogs from the ocean keep the grass of the pastures green long after the fields of Santa Clara have been dried up. In the distance, long rollers of white foam broke along the broad sandy shores of the bay, while long winding lines of glimmering water marked the course of the Pajaro river, and the Salinas with its tributary sloughs, meandering on its course from far inland, to join the blue waters of Monterey bay. Our road, after leaving the mountains, for some six or eight miles, wound round among the broad grain fields and fine farms of the Pajaro, until we arrived at Watsonville, a large and thriving town situated on the bank of Pajaro river. Here we put up for the night.</p><p>Pajaro valley embraces an area of country of some twenty or thirty miles square, generally of a rich rolling prairie, and the river runs down through it near the southerly side. Like many California rivers, it is a very magnificent stream in the summer, in fact a mere brook, but in the rainy season it assumes the most formidable dimensions, and then indeed may well merit the name of river. This valley is considered among the most fertile in the State, and I presume must have derived its name from the swarms of the feathered tribe that frequented this region in the early times, the word “Pajaro” in Spanish, signifying &quot;bird.” The grain crop here is sure and bountiful, and immense quantities of it are raised, which finds a market in San Francisco. Watsonville is the town of the valley, and is supported by the great trade of the surrounding country. It contains some two or three thousand inhabitants, many neat houses, cottages, churches, fine stores, schools, military and fire companies, Masonic Lodge, and all that sort of thing, and is a very pretty, thriving place. It is fast becoming a point of considerable importance. The climate is seldom very cold or very warm, the atmosphere being tempered by the mild breezes and fogs of the Pacific ocean. A railroad will one day connect it with San Francisco. </p><p>Next forenoon we drove over to Lucas' ranche, some ten miles beyond Watsonville. We had to cross one of the sloughs of the Salinas, at the town of St. Paul, a small scrub town of some half dozen houses, comprising a whiskey shop, hotel, ferry-house, saloon, warehouse, &amp;c. The population consisted of three men and a dog. It is a town of small importance at present. The ferry boat was a queer looking scow, of some thirty feet long by twelve wide, decked over, with a paddle wheel on each side, and is manned and navigated by a polite, handsome, and athletic sailor-man, and two bob-tailed horses. The horses were each placed in a sort of private treadmill on either side of the boat, and upon our obliging engineer applying the whip to the aforesaid bob-tails, away we started, and after about fifteen minutes of laborious grinding, tramping and splashing, we were safely landed on the other side, buggy and all.</p><p>At this point the country is low and rolling, and several sloughs or branches of the Salinas wind round through it in a peculiar manner, forming peninsulas, or as the Spaniards term them, &quot;Bolsas,&quot; signifying &quot;pockets,&quot; and they comprise some of the richest kind of grain lands. One of them is called &quot;<em>Bolsa del Moro Cajo,&quot;</em> in honorary remembrance of an old lame gray mustang, who used to graze there a few years ago. Lucas' ranche is finely situated upon the “Bolsa Nueva,&quot; or “new pocket.&quot; He has a fine tract of land, two hundred and fifty acres of which he sows in grain, and the balance he uses for pasturage, residence, canal grounds, &amp;c. He and his enterprising farmer neighbors, during the winter months live principally upon wild geese and ducks, of which there is an immense supply of the choicest kind, to be had just for the shooting. They come and go with the cold weather. In the mountains near there are also plenty of deer, hare, quail, and other fine game. Near the mouth of the Salinas, some two miles from Lucas, is the grand Embarcaders, from whence is shipped the grain and produce of the Pajaro and Salinas country. The steamer Salinas makes regular trips by the ocean route to and from San Francisco, making the run in about six hours. </p><p>The first evening after our arrival, we, together with Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, attended a grand ball, given by J. Norris, Esq., one of our neighbors. All the elite of the country were there. City beaux and country lasses, all commingled in the gay and festive scene. The honest brown hand of the merry farmer boy, led the gay city Miss through the intricate changes of the quadrille, lovely forms and happy hearts whirled in loving embrace through waltz, schottische and mazurka, and bright eyes told thrilling glances to eyes that beamed them back again. At first, being strangers, Harris and myself were somewhat diffident, and stood back like poor boys at a candy frolic; but that soon wore off, and Harris being of a highly genial and susceptible temperament, soon &quot;sailed in,&quot; captivated by the beaming eyes of Miss C ---, a gentle damsel, six feet high. I lost sight of him for some time in the mazes of the dance, being myself busily employed in another quarter, but when next I saw the stricken youth, a soft little white hand rested upon his arm, and by his side was lovely Maggie M ----, the belle of the evening, her soul-lit eyes timidly gazing up into his, as he entertained her with his inexhaustible fund of gay conversation. He looked the happiest man in existence. All was joy and gladness. Music, mirth and jollity reigned supreme. The leader of the orchestra seemed inspired, and drew forth strains from his violin that Ole Bull, Paganini or Sivori never dreamed of. Even the melancholy fellow who played the banjo, and seemed eternally brooding over the sorrows of his youth, gradually became acclimated to the geniality of the scene, and suffered his wan visage to relax into quite a pleasant expression. </p><p>At midnight supper was announced, and all entered with zeal into the destruction of the good things. Cords of pie, stacks of cake, chicken raisins, beans, apples, cheese, potatoes, and tea, rapidly went the way of all good things. After supper came more dancing, then songs from various individuals, then some private hornpipes and jigs, then more general dancing, which lasted till daylight, when all went home satisfied. </p><p>Two or three days afterwards, Lucas, myself, Mrs. L. and another lady, went to Monterey, some forty miles. This is the oldest city in California, and although now about half deserted and going to decay, was once a place of great note as the ancient capital of the State. The historical associations connected with it are very interesting, but its future may never again equal its past. It is the County seat of Monterey County, and the Court House, Jail, and public offices and officers, together with the stir attendant upon an occasional term of Court, constitutes nearly the only element of vitality about the place. The houses are nearly all of the old Spanish “adobe” style, with tiled roof. At the corners of some of the streets, superanuated old cannon are planted in the ground with the muzzles pointing upward by way of corner posts, and we took particular notice of one sidewalk, the pavement of which was formed of the points of whale's back-bone, placed end up, forming quite a smooth, neat pavement. </p><p>Monterey is beautifully located on a fine sloping hill-side, and the range of hills back of the city is covered with a dense growth of pine trees. The surrounding country being mountainous, it has little or no agricultural resources, and the exports are principally hides, tallow, wool, whale oil and firewood. It has a good harbor, with splendid anchorage, but no shipping. Indeed, we only saw one small schooner there. One great branch of business carried on here is whaling; the great bay being so open to the ocean that numerous whales stray into it. Two companies, one Italian and the other American, have their stations here near the city, Capt. Davenport, formerly of New Bedford, commanding the American Co. When the “look-out” stationed on the shore, from his eminence spies a whale, boats put off for him at once. The whale is sometimes taken in the old way, with the harpoon, but they most generally now shoot them with a species of bomb, fired from a cannon, carried in one of the boats, which kills him by exploding within him, when the whale immediately sinks, but after a specified time, he rises again to the surface, and is towed ashore, where his blubber is stripped off and tired out on the beach. </p><p>After a good nights rest at the hotel, early next morning we took a drive down to Point Pinos, three miles from the city. Our road passed through the whaling camps, where we saw them trying out the blubber and appearing to do a pretty good stroke of business. After a delightful drive through and among the shady pines, we soon arrived at the Point. The blue expanse of the great Pacific ocean lay spread out before us in all its grand immensity, and not a cloud obscured the horizon. As far as the vision could extend, the same long line of white foaming rollers still broke heavily along the beach, as they have so unceasingly done since the world begun, still preserving the same eternal white mark, which the Creator of the Universe placed there in the beginning, separating the great brown continent, from the broad blue sea. </p><p>It was a clear, calm, delightful morning, and we strolled along the beach to our heart's content. This is a noted place for gathering shells, and we improved the opportunity by gathering an abundance of very fine ones; among them many splendid Abalone shells, which abound in this locality. On a fine little eminence near the Point, stands a splendid light house, erected by Uncle Sam a few years ago. By invitation of the polite keeper, we went in and inspected the institution. The building is of stone, two stories high, and the lantern tower rises high above the centre roof. The light is a fine Fresnal, of the third order, with a magnificent lens. The two keepers and their families, seemed to enjoy living there very well. </p><p>We returned to the hotel, to dinner, after which, we journeyed homeward; and arrived at Lucas' at 9 o'clock in the evening, very tired, but well pleased with our journey - What with riding, hunting and visiting, Harris and myself contrived to while away ten days very agreeably, and came home from Salinas and Pajaro, quite satisfied with our trip. </p><p>I was in San Francisco a few days since, and of course found it the same bustling, driving, go ahead city as ever. I believe it is the fastest city in Creation. Everybody I met seemed to be either in a hurry, or about to make a rush. The omnibusses, hacks, drays, express wagons, and all sorts of vehicles, could hardly keep out of each others way; even the big brick houses, and the lamp posts, as the hastening throng bustled past them, seemed rushing the other way. The quiet cobble-stone pavement of the streets, has had to yield room for the rail track, and the cars will soon be whirling throughout the city. The merchants, lawyers, and deacons, own fast horses, or bet on the races. </p><p>On the 2d inst., the great foot race for $1,000 a side, came off at the Mission Doleres, between the American runner, David Carr, and the California runner, Pedro Selaya. - Distance one hundred yards, Selaya giving Carr six feet the start. Owing to some misunderstanding in regard to the starting signal, Selaya did not start when it was given, so that Carr ran through without a competitor, and was adjudged to be the winner of the stakes. Large amounts of money changed hands, but much dissatisfaction was felt and expressed by the losers. </p><p>On the 23d ult., at San Jose, Felipe Hernandez, a Mexican desperado, confined in the county jail under sentence of death, by a sudden attack, succeeded in overpowering the jailor, and killed him with his own knife. - This was about three o'clock in the afternoon. Having the keyes of the jail now in possession he proceeded to liberate another Mexican prisoner, in order to have his assistance in freeing himself from his heavy irons, which weighed one hundred pounds. They both worked at them until nearly daylight next morning, before they succeeded. Then after helping themselves to fifteen hundred dollars belonging to the jailor, they left the jail, taking with them some loaded revolvers, food, and whatever else they saw and wanted. Felipe was to have been hung the next day, but when the Sheriff came at nine o'clock the next morning, the bird had flown, and his jailor lay stiff and cold. Of course this tragic affair created much excitement. Rewards to the amount of three thousand dollars were offered at once for the apprehension of Felipe, but notwithstanding the most active exertions, he has not as yet been re-taken. This makes the fifth man he has murdered. </p><p>A company of one hundred light cavalry for active service at the seat of war, is now organized in San Francisco, and will leave fully equipped, on the next steamer for the East. They are picked men, being selected from among nearly three hundred applicants. That is the way we “draft” here. But</p><p>Adios. BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns26.jpg
Rockns27,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXVII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co.,<br />Cal., Jan. 10, 1863.</p><p>DEAR ROCK:--</p><p>The new year with us comes in rather darkly, as far as the farming interest is concerned, as we have had a very unusually dry winter of it thus far, in fact the dryest we have known for several years. Up to the present time but very little rain has fallen, so little indeed, that the ground is hardly wet enough to plow good, whereas, last year by this time, more than half the ploughing was done. But so it goes; one extreme seems to follow another; last year we were flooded and this year we have almost a drought. The Sacramento people, however, will hardly object to the arrangement, for at this time last year that ill-fated city was mostly under water. </p><p>New year's day was observed about in the usual manner here, with the addition of one new feature in San Francisco, as I see by the papers, for notwithstanding the weather was rather rainy and unfavorable for the occasion, a lot of funny fellows got together and gave a most ludicrous and mirth-provoking display, in the shape of a carnival procession, which passed through the principal streets, dressed in all the odd styles and queer dresses that could be imagined. There were hideous masks, masks comical, and faces painted with black cheeks and red noses, together with costumes unmentionable and indescribable. Harlequin was let loose. There were antiquated bonnets of the sugar scoop pattern and jaunty little hats and feathers of the present style, hoops, and full dress without hoops, flounces and plain skirts. The females on this occasion were men, notwithstanding the doubts of many. The “band&quot; rode in a big furniture wagon, and consisted of four hand organs, playing as many airs at the same time, and four drums, beaten regardless of time, like so many boiler makers at work. Tin trumpets and whistles completed the instrumental part of the performance. The captain was equipped with a tin sword, six feet in length, and when turning a corner, he leaped and jumped about as though the safety of the city depended upon his commands being obeyed. Altogether, the boys had a fine time, and every one who witnessed them enjoyed a hearty laugh.</p><p>The colored people of San Francisco and Sacramento celebrated the day in a becoming manner, with mirth, jollity, fasting and praying, in honor of the President's emancipation proclamation, which of course finds great favor with them. </p><p>On the 2d inst., the ship Noonday, 139 days from Boston, bound into San Francisco, struck upon a sunken rock, near the Farralones, with all sail set, and soon sunk; a total loss. The officers and crew took to the boats, only saving the ships papers, chronometer, instruments, and thin clothing, &amp;c. The Noonday was a fine ship of 1,177 tons register, built at Portsmouth, N.H., in 1855, and owned in Boston, by Henry Hastings. She had a cargo of general merchandise, and was consigned to Flint, Peabody &amp; Co. This is her fifth voyage to this port, and her loss was not the result of carelessness, for the sunken rock was not laid down on the chart. </p><p>The news of the capture, by the pirate Alabama, of the steamship Ariel, on her passage from New York to Aspinwall, created a perfect fever of excitement in San Francisco, on the arrival of the Constitution with the Ariel's passengers, and a most profound sensation prevailed among all classes of the community. It is true that but little harm was done by the pirate, but this was the first direct attack which has been made by the rebels upon Californians and California property, and the realities of the war were for the first time brought home to our doors. The effect of the intelligence could not be mistaken. The secessionists, and many calling themselves &quot;Democrats,&quot; generally were jubilant over the news - jubilant over the fact that the American flag had been insulted and an American steamer robbed! Semmes, the commander of the English pirate Alabama, was lauded by them as a hero, and his piratical exploit in stopping and pillaging an unarmed vessel on the high seas, was regarded as an event of historical magnitude. And then, too, some twenty-five of the liberated passengers of the Ariel, filled with sentiments of gratitude towards the pirate captain for letting them off so easily, or inspired with feelings of sympathy towards the Rebel Confederacy, published a laudatory card, in which they say --- &quot;Although it is difficult to dissociate our captor with his letters of marque and reprisal, from the buccaneering of old, always associated with Robin Hoods of the seas, yet we will speak of him as we found him. After taking possession of our ship, he placed Mr. Lowe, one of his lieutenants, with about thirty seamen in charge, whose deportment elicited universal commendation. The management of the ship, under his supervision, was everything that could be desired.”</p><p>Now these twenty-five great-fool passengers, seem perfectly smitten with the loving manners of the gentle pirate. The announcement that the passengers and crew were not to be put to death in cold blood, at once assured them that they were in the hands of gentlemen, not sanguinary Red Rovers. But then &quot;the devil is never so black as he is painted,&quot; is a saying common enough, and the coarse-hair Semmes turns out at last to be a fine polished gentleman. It is said that Semmes composed the following stanzas: -</p><p>“O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,<br />Our thoughts are boundless, and our souls are free; <br />Far as the breeze can bear the billow’s foam, <br />Survey our empire and behold our home.”</p><p>Bully for Semmes. It is fortunate that he and his fellow cruisers fell in with people on board the Ariel who are willing to do him justice, even though he be a Buccaneer. </p><p>The U.S. Marines who were on board the captured steamer and were paroled by the gentle rover, after being deprived of their arms, are now at Mare Island Navy yard, awaiting orders by telegraph from Washington, as to &quot;what shall we do with them.” </p><p>The most perplexing part of the affair consists in the fact that Capt. Jones, of the Ariel, was compelled to give bonds to the pirate captain for the value of the ship, cargo and freight, in all $260,000, to be paid in thirty days after the independence of the Confederate States shall have been gained. The agent of the Pacific Mail Steamship Co., telegraphed at once to New York to know what to do in regard to the freight, &amp;c., per Ariel, which come to hand by the Constitution, and received a reply requiring him to take bonds from the several consignees of the piratically seized freight, which consists of 3000 kegs of butter and a large quantity of general merchandise.</p><p>Great discoveries in the way of gold, silver, copper, and other minerals have lately been made in the coast range of mountains, Near Los Angeles, and in the Colorado region, discoveries have been made of new quatz leads, of astonishing richness in gold and silver, and the prospect is that they will turn out as good or better than Washoe. In the mountains, on both sides of the valley, around San Jose, several leads of gold, silver, and copper bearing rock have lately been discovered, and some of them are very rich. How they will turn out remains to be seen. Even your honored correspondent has again shouldered his pick, and is busily engaged in developing the richness of poverty of a lead of copper ore, away up in the mountains of the north fork of the Penitencia creek, some twelve miles N. E. of San Jose, and this letter is from one of the real old style of miner's cabins, and within, seated at a rough board table, before a big log fire in a huge stone fire-place. But it is getting late; I must retire to my bunk, - so</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns27.jpg
Rockns28,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXVIII.<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />March 20, 1863.</p><p>DEAR MEMORIAL AND ROCK:--</p><p>At the present writing the California population is in an active state of fermentation, in relation to the great mining discoveries recently made, and daily made in all parts of the country. Washoe, Mono, Esmeralda and Coso, are among the older mining districts, where gold and silver exists in any desirable amount you can mention. Just lying about promiscuously, in huge ledges, lodes or leads of rock, extending far into the bowels of the earth, where they have lain hidden from mortal gaze through untold centuries, waiting to reward the fortunate discoverer of the present day. </p><p>The great quantities of silver and gold continually coming in from these localities, attest to the richness of those mines, but still greater discoveries of the precious metals have more recently been made all along the whole great mineral range, from the cold northern regions to the isthmus of Panama. Mexico was long ago noted for her rich mines, but the precious metals were never taken therefrom in the systematic style that they are at present, and will be still more so in the future, for the most modern appliances and improved machinery are now called into requisition, both by companies of Mexican and foreign capitalists, as well as many companies from San Francisco. </p><p>Arizona is also rich in mines of gold, silver, copper, lead, and, in fact, it is said to be apparently the richest mineral region on the North American continent. The Colorado is now noted for its rich minerals, and at &quot;Slate Range&quot; a new mining &quot;district,&quot; some four hundred miles north of here, near Coso, late gold and silver discoveries of marvellous richness, are attracting a host of fortune hunters, and several companies formed in San Jose, are now about ready and will leave for these &quot;new diggings” next week. Richer discoveries than ever are now being also made in Oregon, Washington territory and the British possessions. </p><p>The whole eastern Slope of the Sierra Nevada abounds in rich mines, and the onward march of mineral discovery is gradually progressing into the vast interior of our Continent. Very rich mines were lately discovered on Humboldt river, and still more recently, Reese river, some two hundred and fifty miles from Washoe towards Salt Lake, is discovered to abound in the same rich ledges of gold and silver bearing rock. Most undoubtedly the great range of the Rocky Mountains, as yet so little explored, will by and by be noted for immensely rich mines of all kinds of minerals. And so it goes; each new discovery only demonstrating more and more the necessity and vast importance of the early completion of the grandest project of the present day: the Great Pacific Railroad. </p><p>As regards mineral discoveries, California seems only in her infancy, and more mining excitement exists at the present time than there has been since 1849. San Francisco is the grand headquarters of all mining stock operations, and on an average five and six joint stock companies lately have been incorporated there every day, for the purpose of working mines from Oregon to Mexico. Most of these companies have capital stocks of hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars, as for instance, the Reese River Mining Company filed its articles of incorporation last week with a capital stock of $3,500,000. J.R. Tucker, the rich Montgomery street jeweller is one of the trustees of the company.</p><p>According to the newspapers a rich lead of silver ore was discovered last week in San Francisco, in the intersection of Powell and California streets, and a big joint company is now formed to work it, with a capital of $1,400,000. The ore was discovered in grading a portion of the street, and the discovery, of course, created no little excitement in that populous locality. </p><p>Copper mining has of late occupied a prominent position, owing to the public attention having been attracted to that peculiar style of mineral development, and rich leads of it are now discovered all over the whole extent of the mining region. It exists in different species of rock, principally in the form of sulphurets, oxides, pysites, and other chemical combinations. Unlike gold or silver it has to be separated from the ore by intense heat in a smelting furnace, and as that process is very expensive the ore has thus far been shipped to New York or Boston, or to Swansea in England, where there are extensive works erected for the purpose. There is a large company now organized in San Francisco for the purpose of reducing the copper ores in this State. They propose erecting their furnaces at Antioch, near the mouth of the San Joaquin and in close proximity to the Monte Diablo coal mines, which is found to produce coal that is admirably adapted to the purpose. It is an enterprise which cannot fail to pay exceedingly well. </p><p>In a few localities in the State, native copper is found. Considerable quantities of it have been discovered in the district where I am engaged in mining, some twelve miles from San Jose. Here it is found in a peculiar grayish and quartose rock, which is exceedingly hard and tough. The bright pure copper is disseminated through the rock in small particles, some of which are invisible to the naked eye. Where much of it is found in the surface, or &quot;croppings&quot; of a ledge, it is not generally a very good indication of a rich mine, however. Native copper is sometimes found in huge masses. At the mines of Lake Superior several large pieces have been found, and one large mass found in 1821, was computed to weigh 2200 pounds. </p><p>The coming season will doubtless be productive of a greater yield of mineral wealth on this coast than was ever before known. San Francisco alone is the headquarters of over two hundred mining companies, the majority of which were formed on the strength of rich and extensive mineral discoveries made last fall and during the past winter. All are preparing to go into active and extensive operations as soon as the weather becomes settled and the season is fairly opened. The yield of the precious minerals for the coming season will astonish the world; and while, doubtless, many of the enterprises will prove unsuccessful, the aggregate will succeed in adding millions to the wealth of the State, as well as adding millionaires to the assessment roll. </p><p>Large quantities of tobacco will be raised here this season, as a great many farmers throughout the State are going largely into the business, and our climate is peculiarly well adapted to its successful production. It is a plant natural to the country, for it grows wild almost anywhere; from the sea coast to the summit of the Sierra. Those who tried it last year found it highly profitable business. It will probably be more so this season.</p><p>There are some also who are going to attempt the raising of cotton, and they anticipate success in this as well as in raising tobacco. Hops, too, flourish here exceedingly well, and those raised here being a much better price than the imported: being a much better article. Last year, nearly or quite enough hops were raised for home consumption, and this season being far more favorable than last, and many more acres being cultivated, we shall probably have plenty for export. </p><p>But while thus engaged in cultivating the ways of peace, we are still having an eye to the arts of war, and are steadily endeavoring to do our part towards crushing out the unholy rebellion which has arisen to blight with its withering curse the fair fame and prospects of so many of our sister States. The last installment of troops called for from this State, is being rapidly filled out by volunteers, and if more are called for, we can still get along without drafting. Under the late requisition, four companies of &quot;native California cavalry,&quot; were called for. Their ranks are already nearly full, and portions of them have been mustered into service. The idea was a capital one, as it gives our native Californians a chance to distinguish themselves in a way that suits them admirably, for although in the solid fighting qualities and physical stamina that go to make up the true soldier, they must of course rank below the Anglo Saxon race, yet, as real dashing dare-devil horseman, they are hard to beat, and with the right sort of leaders, will be found to be very efficient cavalry. </p><p>One company of them, raised in San Jose, has gone into camp near San Francisco, under command of Capt. Jose Ramon Pico. He is a young man of good family, very smart, active, intelligent, and I think will make a capital leader for them, although he has little or no military experience. He is the same Ramon Pico, mentioned in one of my former letters, who rode horseback one hundred and fifty miles in little less than ten hours, over the San Jose race course, in his famous match against time, some eighteen months ago. </p><p>In naval matters too, we are trying to keep pace with the times. We are well aware that our coast, and especially the harbor and bay of San Francisco, would be virtually at the mercy of a hostile fleet of iron clads, such as the &quot;Monitor.&quot; Yes, even one like her would probably pass the forts with impunity, and San Francisco would then be at the mercy of her shot and shell. But in view of such an unhappy contingency, a first class iron clad, the <em>Comanche</em>, has been built especially for this coast by the Federal government, and she will shortly arrive here. Meanwhile, matters are not idle at the Mare Island Navy Yard. The sloop of war Decatur is now about ready for service, having been armed with four eight inch Dahlgrens, and four thirty-two pounders. She will probably be permanently stationed in San Francisco harbor. The U.S. steamer Saginaw is also to be stationed there to protect the port. Two heavy rifled cannon are added to her armament. The old frigate Independence is to be converted into a propeller; she is to be iron plated and have two turrets, built similar to those on the first class vessels of the Atlantic States. The U.S. sloop-of-war Cyane, also is to be thoroughly refitted, and together with the others will take out quite a formidable fleet for Jeff Davis' boats to encounter. </p><p>Nearly all the machinery for the new Government foundry at Mare Island has arrived. It is said to be superior to any ever before brought out to this coast. The Government officers at the Island have also drafts of all improved ordnance now manufactured in the Atlantic States. If the requisite metal can be obtained - and we think it can - all of the contemplated improvements will be speedily and effectively carried out. </p><p>“St. Patrick's Day&quot; was celebrated in extra grand style in San Francisco and in San Jose, with processions, orations, grand military and civic turnouts, big dinners, &amp;c. and balls and all sorts of jollifications wound up the festivities of the occasion, and many a broken nose, black eye, or aching head, next morning, testified to the thorough enjoyment of many of the participants.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns28.jpg
Rockns29,"<p>California Correspondence<br />No. XXIX<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal.,<br />April 20, 1863</p><p>Dear Memorial and Rock:--</p><p>Since the date of my last letter, times here in California have continued to become more and more “stirring;” in fact the public mind seems to have been worked up to a sort of chronic fever heat, and in nervous expectation each moment of something new, exciting and strange about to &quot;turn up.” The important capture of the rebel privateer schooner &quot;chapman,&quot; which was seized in San Francisco harbor a few days ago, by the U.S. Marines, just as she was about to leave, with men, armament and munitions of war concealed on board together with certain overt acts and demonstrations of the &quot;secesh&quot; in various parts of the State, have put the trusty guardians of the Union even more on the alert. Every vessel that now leaves or arrives, is subjected to strict surveillance, and all suspicious movements on the part of secessionists or rebel sympathizers are carefully noted. </p><p>The secessionists in this State are known to be pretty well organized, and for a long time to have had in view a concerted plan for the overthrow of the U.S. authority here, and the placing of this State either under the rule of the Southern Confederacy, or in the event of a dismemberment of the Federal Union, of even forming a &quot;Pacific Republic,&quot; with the addition of Oregon, Washington Territory, Lower California, Sonora, Arizona, and such other desirable territory as they might deem it advisable to “admit.”</p><p>Now the idea of a separation, as far as the two sides of the continent are concerned, is certainly a much more rational one than that of the separation of the North from the South, for, while it is difficult to draw the line of division between those two sections, we of the Pacific are already naturally separated from the other States by lofty mountain ranges, broad rivers and deserts. In fact until the telegraph was established, we were virtually disconnected. </p><p>Before California was admitted into the Union, we all used to speak as we do even now, of the &quot;news from the States,&quot; and of &quot;going home to the States,&quot; as though we were far away out of the Union, and then the &quot;news from the States,&quot; - a month old - coming to us by way of foreign countries, as did also most of the emigration, only tended to realize to us how far we were from &quot;home;&quot; but gradually, by means of overland expresses, and lastly, by the telegraph, we are placed in direct communion with our friends of &quot;the other side,&quot; the magic wire literally connecting us with the rest of the public. And when the great Pacific Railroad, passing through our own broad territory shall bind the two sides together with its iron bonds, and the thundering tramp of the iron horse shall have annihilated both time and space, then shall we begin to feel that we are fully of the Union and under the sheltering wing of the glorious Republic of the Starry Banner. </p><p>But all these pretty little schemes of the secesh traitors cannot win; it would be highly desirable to them, no doubt, to steal us from the Union, but, &quot;that little thing can't be did.&quot; The “secesh” are numerous enough here, but true loyal hearts are still more numerous and able to keep all traitors in a proper state of subjection, let them plot and scheme as they will. They had it all fixed up to capture this State on Friday the 3d inst., but the capture of that schooner upset the whole arrangement. They would have seized the Navy Yard, forts, armories, &amp;c., - if they could - but at all these desirable places everything was put in order for their reception and will be kept so in the future, as the Navy Yard is now placed on a &quot;war footing&quot; as well as all the forts, &amp;c. The officers and crew of the rebel pirate Chapman, are confined at Fort Alcatraz. </p><p>Warren P. Miller, of Marysville, has obtained a patent for a new style of gunboat. The chief feature of the invention consists in the gun or guns, being mounted on a turn-table, which, when not in action, is intended to remain in the hold. This platform, or turntable, when used, is raised by steam power to a level with the upper deck, and the gun, or guns, being fired in the desired direction, it descends again to be reloaded, during which time a heavy iron shield covers the hole and renders the deck perfect. The only person required to be on deck is the gunner, who is safely ensconced in a small iron turret at the rear of the gun on the turn-table. </p><p>Nearly $800,000 of the treasure lost by the wreck of the Golden Gate, on the 28th of last July, has been recovered up to the present time, by the expedition which was fitted out for the purpose.</p><p>The mining <em>furor</em> which has pervaded the public mind so much of late, is still on the increase, as rich and more extensive discoveries are being made. An immense rush is now being made for Washoe and other parts of Nevada Territory. Four stages leave this side of the mountains daily, jammed full, and so great is the rush that passengers are obliged to book their names for seats four days in advance. A friend of mine just from there the other day, says he counted over three hundred &quot;foot passengers,&quot; on the road between Carson City and Placerville. </p><p>The old claims in Washoe, too, are turning out richer than ever, and enormous &quot;dividends&quot; are paid by very many of the companies. In the &quot;Gould &amp; Curry&quot; claim, on the Comstock lead, week before last, they took out <em>half ton of pure native silver</em>. It takes a big pile of money to buy a foot in such a claim as that. It is these big yields and “dividends” that incite people to go and try their luck at it. Joint stock companies are still incorporating at the rate of six to ten a day, in San Francisco, for the, purpose of working the mines in different parts of the country. If only one half of them ever pay any sort of a &quot;dividend,&quot; it will certainly be doing well. One good thing results from it, that's certain; all their documents, certificates of stock, transfers, &amp;c., have to be &quot;stampted,&quot; so that Uncle Sam is the gainer by the operation, at any rate. It appears to me that the &quot;stamp&quot; revenue derived from California must certainly be greater than from any other State in the Union. </p><p>Spiritualism, too, seems to be on the increase here, for I understand that &quot;spiritual circles&quot; are again in fashion in San Francisco and elsewhere, and hundreds of people nightly spend their time experimenting with the &quot;odic forces.&quot; Well, &quot;every one to their taste,&quot; as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. If they find pleasure in distorting their diseased imaginations into the belief that the ghostly thumpings they listen to are real palpable messages from the world of spirits, all right. If they wish to unveil the mysteries beyond the tomb, if they wish to raise the spirit of old Mather Byles, or even raise the Devil, why, let them just &quot;bile in.&quot; Perhaps it’s all a humbug; if so, “viva la humbug;&quot; everybody now-a-days takes a lively pleasure in being humbugged. </p><p>But joking aside; what are the good results of Spiritualism? Our lunatic asylums do not speak well for it. Investigation may lead to future good, and the darkness of the present may yet be changed to light. It is certainly a subject of very much interest to me, as I have ever seen anything of this strange doctrine; not a &quot;manifestation,&quot; &quot;nary rap.&quot; The people of this State have generally been too practical in their ideas to find time for the investigation of such theories, and we have never had any prominent expounders of the doctrine among us, except poor Crane, and they hung him up at Auburn several years ago. </p><p>The resident physician of the Insane Asylum at Stockton, a few days ago, had one of the patients of the Institution employed in his garden trimming some trees, when a man on horseback passing by, hailed the insane man with - &quot;Hello there! what are you doing?&quot; He immediately replied with “Hello there! where are you goin’?&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; said the horseman, &quot;but that's not answering my question.” “Well, now, look here, you thunderin’ old fool,&quot; said the crazy fellow, &quot;you've got the advantage of me; you can see mighty plain what I am doin', but d---n me if I can see where you're goin'.” There is some sense in such madness as that, and such insanity is certainly worth repairing. </p><p>New potatoes are now plenty in the markets, green peas, radishes, lettuce, &amp;c., have been in market for several weeks, and in Stockton they had a shower of frogs the other day, real live little green fellows, that went hopping about the streets as lively as crickets. But</p><p>Adios,</p><p>BEN BOLT.</p>",public://rock/Rockns29.jpg
Rockns30,"<p>No. XXX<br />Milpitas, Santa Clara Co., Cal., June 11<sup>th</sup> 1863<br />“Moving on”</p><p>Dear Memorial and Rock:--</p><p>Having just returned from a trip to San Francisco, I will give you a few notes on what I saw there. I found it the same bustling, noisy, rushing city as ever, and not having been there for some six months, I could not but note the improvements which had been brought about in that short space of time. Many splendid buildings had been erected including one or two first class hotels, fine, large, elegant, stone buildings. Then through all the principal streets, tracks are laid, and every few minutes the handsome and commodious street omnibus cars, go whirling past each drawn by two or four dashing roadsters. Six cents is the charge for a ride from one extreme of the city to the other. The citizens find these street railroads a great convenience, and they are well patronized accordingly.</p><p>Sunday morning the &quot;merry church bells were pealing forth in chorus loud and clear,&quot; and they very forcibly reminded me of the bright Sunday morning long ago, when we sailed from Old Plymouth bound for this land of much promise. The sound of those well remembered bells, just ringing for church are lingering still in my ears; the last farewell sound of home. &quot;When you are among Romans you must do as Romans do&quot; is an ancient maxim, and acting upon that suggestion, I spent that Sunday after the manner of San Franciscans generally. That is to say I did as I saw the majority do, following the biggest crowd, I went to one of the big churches. It was the Unitarian church on Stockton street, a fine large stone building, with the &quot;stars and stripes&quot; waving from a flag staff over the roof.</p><p>In deep humility I removed my humble hat from my sinful head, as I entered the sacred edifice. The polite and gentlemanly, in attendance was merciful to a sinner from the country, and escorted me to a good comfortable seat. The inside of the church was roomy, cool, and well ventilated - and the pews were commodious, being made to contain six gentlemen, or three ladies. There were about a thousand people present; a grand collection of fashionable society. Gents in full broadcloth, white chokers, and hair combed erect. Ladies in rustling silks, peaked roofed bonnets, with big bouquets of large roses in the gable ends, and surrounded with an atmosphere of hoops, flounces, crinolin, ribbons, laces, feathers, and cologne. The pulpit, represented a sort of alcove, with big pillars on either side, with altar in front, and both alcove and altar trimmed with crimson velvet, big tassels, and patent lamps, while from the central part of the building hung two large stylish chandeliers. Opposite the altar, was the &quot;singer seats,&quot; or orchestra, with a big organ in the back ground and a big clock in front.</p><p>As I entered, the lordly organ was sounding grandly forth in the performance of a grand overture. The music rose and fell in fine cadences; now grandly swelling, and again melting away. Then in the midst of a neat little enclosure in front of the organ, formed by means of gay, well arranged curtains rose a fine looking lady fashionably dressed in the full sail style and sky-scraper rig of the present day and gave us an opera. Her rich melodious voice rang, clear and sweet; now trilling clear, and high and anon warbling soft and low. I had never heard such fine singing in the churches out in the country. I was delighted. When she finished, no one stamped or applauded, as they do at Maguire's Opera House. It was probably sacred opera. The silence was, unbroken save by an old gentleman sneezing most furiously, which I considered as in extremely bad taste, for such singing as that was not to be sneezed at.</p><p>Then behind the altar arose the Rev. Thomas Starr King, dressed in a flowing black robe, like Rev Mr. Briggs used to wear - and in his full, distinct voice, read a chapter from the Bible. Then he &quot;lined off&quot; a hymn, in two line instalments. The big organ gave a few preliminary groans from its laboring bowels, then it grandly pealed forth in lordly strains again. This time one other lady, and two gentlemen joined in the opera. This was followed by a most impressive and eloquent prayer. The gentlemen bowed their heads; the ladies bowed their sky-scrapers with big cabbage roses in the fronticepiece. Then Starr King arose and gave out the number of the hymn to be sung. It was performed by the opera troupe in the same fine style, with solo and chorus. Starr King then gave out his text, but I couldn't hear what it was, as just at that time some enterprising Celestial, let off a bunch of fire crackers in the street near by. The text was something about &quot;faith in God,&quot; and from it, he preached a well delivered and most eloquent sermon. I had never heard this celebrated preacher before, and was much impressed with both his style and his sermon. The sermon was short, and at the conclusion of it the old ancient custom was indulged in, of &quot;passing round the plate.&quot; After a short overture on the organ the opera troupe joined again in solo and chorus, which the audience enjoyed standing. There with arms outstretched after the style of Paul preaching at Athens, Rev. T. Starr King gave us the benediction, and all passed again to the stern realities of the outer world.</p><p>As a faithful chronicler I must tell you what San Francisco people do Sunday afternoon. Still following the biggest crowd, I took the Mission railroad cars which left every fifteen minutes, during the day. The train was so crowded that I had to take passage on the hurricane deck which was also full. The iron horse snorted, puffed, and champed his iron bits, and in a few minutes we were whirled through among the green oaks, sandy lawns, and pretty cottages of the suburbs, three miles at a charge of only a &quot;bit&quot; to the &quot;Willows&quot; near The Mission.</p><p>&quot;The Willows”, as the name indicates is simply a willow grove in a flat ravine, covering some eight or ten acres of ground. The undergrowth has all been cleared out, trees trimmed up, walks laid out, rustic arbors and seats arranged, flowers set out, swings erected, and various amusements projected, such as bowling alleys, shooting galleries, flying horses, &amp;c. A large hotel at the side of the grove furnished refreshments and accommodations for man or beast, and near by a large pavilion was erected in which a theatrical minstrel troupe were performing. The &quot;two bits&quot; fee of admission to the grounds, also entitled one to go in to the pavilion - so in I went accordingly, as all the crowd did.</p><p>The house was full and I should judge there were fully fifteen hundred people present; men, women, boys, and girls. The troupe performing was the one attached to Gilberts Melodeon in the city, and consisted of male and female performers; all of them first rate. They played &amp; sang many very beautiful pieces, humorous songs, solos &amp;c, and did some very excellent dancing. At 6 PM the performance was over, and all hands took the cars again for the city. Every Sunday this beautiful, and very popular summer resort is thronged with visitors, promenading the beautiful avenues and pleasure grounds, beneath the shady groves and among the flowers. It is in fact about the only suburban resort worth mentioning, but Mr. Editor you are not to suppose that I joined in such general dissipation because I liked it. Oh no! not at all - of course not - but simply as a faithful reporter, a la Ned Buntline.</p><p>&quot;Biscacciants,&quot; celebrated in years past as a great opera singer and &quot;prima donna,&quot; and whose delicious warblings justly entitled her to the name of &quot;The American thrush&quot; is now singing in San Francisco at a low &quot;free and easy&quot; called the &quot;bella Union.&quot; She has dissipated considerably of late years, and her voice gradually failing, she also had descended the scale.</p><p>When I am in San Francisco I always make it a point to call at the Southern Packet office of N. Pierce &amp; Co, where I greatly enjoy a chat with Capt. Pierce and his clerk JB Simmons Esq., both fellow Plyrmoutheans. We talk over old times at home, compare notes, read the &quot;Memorial and Rock,&quot; and discuss the home news generally. Capt. Pierce is a fine looking, erect, straight forward gentleman, on whose brow time leaves but little trace. He resides with his wife and family in a delightful suburban residence. He is principal owner in a line of packets running down the Southern Coast to San Pedro, and other ports, and doing a lucrative business. Capt. Wm Morton also of Plymouth, is capt of one of the packets. I did not see him. JB Simmons is an extremely sober sided looking individual, the sorrows of his riper years, appearing to have overshadowed the joys of his youth, and settled upon him as a sort of chronic melancholy. But just talk with him a bit about Old Plymouth; draw him out a little, and just see how the natural geniality of his disposition will give a full expression to his physiognomy, and you will soon find him to be a downright good fellow. </p><p>The San Francisco police assembled at their drill room and drill every day with muskets as infantry, and in case of emergency will be found very effective. Week before last, two, a camp of instruction was organized at the (---) just across the Bay, under a call from the Governor. It was composed of the officers of the different military companies throughout the State and they were called together for ten days in order to instruct them in the arts of war, and learn them all the latest military tactics.</p><p>Exhibited in a show window on Montgomery st I saw the splendid sword about to be presented to Maj Gen Joe Hooker by his California friends. It is a most magnificent affair costing thousands of dollars and resplendent with gold and diamonds. I don't know why he should have such a splendid sword given him, before he has earned it. I was reading a few days ago about some one of our colonels being presented with a splendid set of silver cap service, by some of his admiring friends. Better have him do a little field service first. Oh if you have got any money to spend on such baubles, give it to the sanitary fund. Let the Col drink out of a tin pot, and let Hooker use a cheaper sword. We are sadly in need of colonels who can stand soldiers fare, and of iron men with good steel swords. </p><p>The San Francisco &amp; San Jose railroad is slowly progressing - two shiploads of the iron and rolling stock have arrived, and the road it is said will be completed and the cars running as far as San Mateo - halfway to San Jose - by the first of August.</p><p>I was down in the Pajaro valley a few days ago and found the crops of grain generally looking very finely. Of course I was over on the &quot;Bolsa Nuevo&quot; rancho, and saw Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lucas and found them well and happy, and she wearing the same merry smile as ever. The wild geese had all flown north. I asked Fred what they had to live on, now that the geese were all gone; Clams, replied he; clams, we’ve got plenty of clams; and can live on them till the geese come again. So the friends of Mrs. Lucas will be pleased to learn that she is all right as far as grub is concerned. But then if they will insist on eating nothing but roast goose and clam chowder, I'd like to know what they raise green peas, potatoes, and all that other garden “sass” for. To give to their neighbors probably.</p><p>A tributary slough of the Salinas river, called “Elk-horn” slough winds and ramifies itself around far inland and separates the Bolsa Nuevo in a measure from the rest of the county. This crooked slouth is not wide, or deep, but troublesome, as there being no bridge over it, it has to be crossed in boats and oftentimes the boat being left on the wrong side, when one wishes to cross, creates quite a bother. Your correspondent once attempted to swim across, in order to bring the boat over, but finding the mud at the edge of the water, soft, stinking, black, and of an illimitable depth, he gave it up in supreme disgust.</p><p>This slough abounds in many kinds of good fish, and is navigable for light draught steamers. All along the sloping hill sides on either hand are many big ranches and fine farms where dwell also many a rosy cheeked farmers daughter. Fine girls they are too, all of them, none of you &quot;prinked up&quot; city missess, ready to faint if a dog barks at them, but real substantial smart sensible girls. One of them, Miss Lizzie L - a blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked lass, amused me considerably one day by shooting a small hawk which lit on a tree near her father’s house. She used a big double barreled shotgun. She handled the weapon as cool as a cucumber, and as scientifically as an old sportsman. Of course I didn't &quot;let on&quot; that she had done anything unusual, or that I was at all surprised to see a girl fire off a gun. Oh no, not a bit. I have heard and read of such a thing, but never saw it before.</p><p>As the heading of this letter indicates, like poor “Joe” in Dickens &quot;Bleak House&quot;, I am about &quot;moving on&quot;. These copper diggings are getting “played out;&quot; they don't pay, and now I'm going where the “big diggings” are. My next letter will be dated from Washoe the far famed land of silver and gold, some four hundred miles from here, and that much nearer to your side of the continent. Everybody has gone, or is going, and I am going also, just merely to follow the crowd.</p><p>Adios,</p><p>Ben Bolt</p>",public://rock/Rockns30.jpg
Rockns31,"<p>No XXXI<br />Como, Nevada Territory, July 18<sup>th</sup> 1863</p><p>Dear Memorial and Rock,</p><p>Since the date of my last latter, I have, as I said I should - left the fair and fertile valley of Santa Clara, and taken a long cruise far inland, to the strike regions of the land of silver. I sent my baggage by express, and came through myself on horseback. I rode from San Jose to San Francisco, took my horses on board the Sacramento steamer, and from Sacramento, I hurried through, as fast as my horses could stand it, changing the saddle, often from one to the other - averaging fifty miles per day, of land travel and making the entire distance from San Jose to this place in six days travelling time. It was a quick and very pleasant trip, and I enjoyed it enough, especially the route up, through California, among the many romantic valleys, towns and villages of the gold mines. Those world-renowned placers do not wear the same busy aspect now that they did when I knew them a few years ago, being mostly worked out and comparatively deserted. The oldest and poorest diggings are worked mostly by Chinese of whom I saw considerable numbers, busy gleaning the leavings of the white miners. </p><p>As I proceeded up through the more elevated mountain region, I left the mines behind, and my route took me up among the heavily timbered passes, and over excellent roads, being a regular succession of easy ascending grades, made with much toil and expense around the mountain sides, each being a private toll road and kept in fine order, having water sprinkling carts continually passing up and down them, to lay the dust. These carts are supplied from the thousands of running brooks, and springs, all along the road, the water being of the sweetest, coolest, purest and best in the world. At convenient distances too, wayside inns, hotels, and stations afford shelter and refreshment for man or beast. I had no companion, but was not alone, for I passed men and teams in plenty. I hurried on, and passed everything on the road except the stages and expresses.</p><p>I proceeded onward and upward among the eternal snows and bleak rocky summits of the Sierra Nevada, passed the eastern boundary line of California and at length came abruptly to the eastern slope of the Sierra, and in full view of Carson Valley with its dark green belt of meadows and a few trees winding down through the middle of it, marking the course of Carson river, all along the river are farms and ranches, but the valley generally, away from the borders of the river, is a sterile plain covered with low sage brush, with no trees. I descended the eastern slope by a long step, and tortuous grade down to the valley and at dark arrived at the little old town of Genoa, where I put up for the night. Near here I passed the camp of Cos B and D, 3d reg Cal infantry, they having also arrived this evening from near Sacramento, en route for Salt Lake. They had three, field pieces along, two sixes and one nine pounder. They were a hardy looking set of men, and were armed with Miner rifles. They march at the rate of about fifteen miles per day. </p><p>My route from the foot of the Sierra lay across a bleak, desolate, sandy plain and low hills covered with the eternal sage brush, and scarce any other sign of vegetation. I passed through the thriving towns of Carson, and Dayton, stopped and took a bath in Carson river, and on the 24th ult I arrived safely at this place, feeling none the worse for my long journey, and in fact - fresh - or fresher than when I started. I readily found certain friends who preceded me here some time ago, and had located mining claims for me, and also found good quarters awaiting me. </p><p>Nevada Territory lies wholly within the rim of what is known as the Great Basin, being the elevated and barren region sometimes called the Great American Desert, stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Sierra Nevada. The entire surface of the Territory is covered with lofty hills and ranges of mountains, separated by sterile valleys and plains, which in many cases take the form of wide extended deserts. The mountains generally contain a moderate amount of wood, grass, and water, none of which are found to any extent on the plains. These ranges run for the most part passable to the main Sierra, their general direction being north and south, with a slight inclination to the south east and northwest, and in these ranges of mountains are found the silver and gold bearing quartz ledges. These ledges have been found however to make their appearance only in certain localities, or &quot;Districts,&quot; which are known by various names and each District has its own code of laws, governing the mines of the locality. </p><p>The whole country has an absolute altitude of 4,000 feet above the sea, the mountains rising to a height varying from two to five thousand feet above its common surface and in some instances shooting up to the height of 10,000 ft. This great elevation renders the climate fickle, and subject to extremes of heat and cold. Virginia City, where the silver was first discovered, lies in a very barren locality on the eastern slope of the Sierra, near the little valley of Washoe, from whence the mines recieved the name by which they are known throughout the world and Washoe is the name which the new State will receive, which will be soon erected from this Territory.</p><p>Some twenty miles in a south easterly direction from Virginia City in the first range of mountains on the opposite side of Carson Valley lies Palmyra District about in the center of which stands the young and flourishing town of Como, in Lyon County, where your enterprising correspondent is now located. It is a town of some thirty houses about all of which have been erected this year. </p><p>The mines - of which I will speak more fully in my next letter - are believed to be among the best in the Territory, but as no mills have yet been erected here, for the reduction of the ores, nothing is at present known in regard to the ledges, except from limited tests and assays. The machinery, however, for the first mill, is now on its way, and is now daily expected here. Meanwhile, speculating in mining claims and town lots is the order of the day. </p><p>Town lots sell every day at from two to twelve hundred dollars, each; two stage lines run here daily neither line paying, as yet. Big stocks of goods are coming in, with the expectation of future profit. Other mills are soon to be put up here, and all is being done with the idea of future remuneration, present profit being of secondary importance. It would amuse you much, to see the numerous ragged and seedy looking miners with hardly a cent in their pockets talking about their thousands and thousands of dollars worth of property in the way of &quot;feet&quot; in rich ledges.

Rockns32,"<p>California Correspondence.<br />No. XXXII<br />Como, Palmyra District, N. T.,<br />Sept. 14, 1863</p><p>EDS. MEMORIAL &amp; ROCK:- </p><p>Since my last letter, the machinery and material for the first mill in this District has arrived, and is now in process of erection. The work is being hurried forward just as fast as the energetic application of unlimited capital will admit of, and in less than two months from now, we expect the mill to start, crushing the rich rock. Other mills will soon be erected here, but this is the one that will tell the most important story - the richness or poverty of the District. It took some ten teams, of from six to twelve mules or oxen each, to bring the iron work and machinery from Sacramento here, and when the first instalment of three wagon loads arrived, it was received with great rejoicings by all the miners, and people generally, who turned out in grand procession, with picks, shovels, &amp;c, on their shoulders, and escorted the wagons down to the mill-site, some half a mile below town, marching to the stirring strain of &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; performed by a fine band of music. The willing hands of the sturdy miners very soon transferred the big heavy castings from the wagons to the ground; a young barrel of &quot;lager beer&quot; was used up, speeches were made appropriate to the occasion, the old pine-clad hills echoed back the hearty cheers of the multitude, the band played &quot;Hail Columbia,&quot; and the jubilant reception of the pioneer mill will long be remembered by the participants. </p><p>One of these quartz mills is a costly and ponderous affair, and it is no small undertaking to get one of them up. The machinery is all cast and manufactured in San Francisco, sent by steamer to Sacramento, and thence it is brought on big heavy wagons, drawn by mules or oxen, some two hundred miles, over the Sierra Nevada to the Territory. The freight bill alone, from San Francisco here, for this mill, amounts to over four thousand dollars, and the mill, when completed and running, will cost over fifty thousand dollars. </p><p>The mines of the District cover an area of some six square miles, the general direction of these gold and silver bearing quartz ledges is N. W. by N. and S. F. by E., running parallel with each other, at a comparative distance of from ten yards to two hundred yards or more, apart, the intervening spaces being of the regular soft granite formation of the country. The &quot;enclosing wall&quot; or &quot;casing&quot; of each ledge, is a soft white rock, somewhat resembling chalk, but not so white, and much harder. The ledges or &quot;leads&quot; are well defined, and are traced by the &quot;croppings,&quot; on the surface of the ground, often for many miles, but they sometimes take a sharp &quot;dip,&quot; and are &quot;lost.&quot; They are generally from two to ten feet in thickness, and descend to an illimitable depth. In fact a good silver mine is considered eternal and inexhaustible, becoming richer the deeper it is worked. The ledges are discovered by the &quot;outcroppings&quot; on the surface, which plainly indicate the locality and direction, although many ledges show little or no &quot;croppings,&quot; and therefore are only discovered by close search, or by accident; these are called &quot;blind ledges.&quot; </p><p>By the laws of this District, the discoverer or &quot;locator&quot; of a claim, is allowed to locate two hundred feet each, for every man in his company, and one extra two hundred feet to himself for the discovery. There are generally from six to twelve men in a company, and the first thing is to put up a notice on the claim, indicating the ground claimed, the names of the claimants, and name of the claim. Then the claim has to be recorded by the mining recorder of the District, who puts a fee for his services in measuring out the ground claimed, fixing a stake at each end of the claim, and recording the same, fifty cents for each two hundred feet. Thereafter, there must be ten dollars worth of work for each two hundred feet, done upon it each month; in default of which, the claim is liable to be &quot;re-located&quot; or &quot;jumped&quot; by outside parties, who in tum have to go through the same routine. </p><p>After locating and recording a claim, the next thing is to &quot;prospect it,&quot; which is generally done by sinking a shaft , or running a tunnel, with as little work and expense as possible, the only object being to examine the vein as far beneath the &quot;croppings&quot; as practicable. If the ledge runs through a steep hill, a tunnel run into the side of the hill is the best way of getting at the lead, but if it is in a flat, a shaft has to be sunk. A practiced eye can tell whether the rock is &quot;good&quot; or not, the silver in combination with the baser metals, sulphurets, and pyrites of iron, antimony, and other minerals, giving it a blueish, and the presence of the red chloride of silver, a reddish cast. There is also much gold found in combination with it, but the silver generally predominates in much the greatest proportion. Of course the expense of &quot;prospecting&quot; is considerable, and has to be divided equally among the company, according to each one's &quot;interest.&quot; Sometimes a company will do all the work themselves, taking it &quot;turn about,&quot; and not hire any work done; but most generally an &quot;assessment&quot; is made, of perhaps ten or twenty cents to the foot or share, and men put to work either by the day, or by contract. </p><p>When a claim is found to be good, the company is most generally incorporated, and the control of the business of the company placed in the hands of a board of three or five trustees. On incorporating, the certificates of stock are got out, which are tangible evidence of the amount of each one's interest in the capital stock. These certificates are generally gotten up in San Francisco, and are printed on fine paper, with appropriate designs, vignettes, and engraving work, something of the same style as bank notes, but in size, somewhat larger. Much of it is gotten up in splendid style, without regard to expense. - On the certificate is stated the amount of capital stock, number of shares, where and when incorporated name of company, where located, &amp;c., and goes on to set forth that Mr. ---, is entitled to a certain number of shares in the capital stock of the aforesaid company. </p><p>Each certificate is signed by the President and Secretary of the company. For instance, if I owned two hundred shares, I could have it issued to me in &quot;tens&quot; and &quot;fives,&quot; or any other convenient form, as best might suit me, and if the ground were worth five dollars per foot or share, each certificate would represent the value of fifty, or twenty-five dollars, as the case might be; and with these certificates much trading is done, it being to a certain degree used as money. In some of the older Districts, Virginia for instance, companies are gotten up, incorporated, and stock issued on no ledge at all; real bogus affairs. Their issues are called &quot;Wild Cat&quot; stock, and the stock market is pretty well supplied with it. The stock brokers understand their business, of course, and by combining together they are able to puff and blow these &quot;Wild Cat&quot; stocks, until they often run them up to a higher price than what really good stock is worth , and about that time they sell out, and down goes the &quot;Wild Cat,&quot; to be bought up cheap, and repeat. In mining stocks, of course, there is the greatest kind of chance for wild speculations, and many a fortune is won and lost at it; but investments in the stock of a really good mine, the reputation of which is fully established, are really good; for the stock increases in price, as the mine turns out better. The &quot;Gould and Curry&quot; mine, for instance, at Virginia City, on the far-famed &quot;Comstock&quot; ledge, is now sold at over six thousand dollars per foot or share, which three or four years ago went begging at five dollars per foot. </p><p>When a claim is ascertained to be rich enough to pay for working, the rock is taken out in a systematic manner, by means of spacious tunnels and shafts, and hauled in heavy wagons direct to the mill, where it is crushed, and the precious metals separated, at a cost of about twenty to thirty dollars per ton, and what remains over and above expenses, is divided among the stockholders, according to the number of shares which each one holds. The &quot;Gould and Curry&quot; declares a monthly dividend of one hundred and fifty dollars to the foot or share. </p><p>In this District, there are a great many claims that are known to be good, but as nothing has been or can be made from them until the mill can crush the rock, the stocks in them are selling from five to fifty dollars per foot. Among the most prominent among them are the &quot;Shiloh,&quot; &quot;Wagram,&quot; &quot;Sharon ,&quot; &quot;Dacotah,&quot; &quot;Rey Del Monte,&quot; &quot;Rapidan,&quot; &quot;Monte Cristo,&quot; &quot;Rappahannock,&quot; &quot;Minerva,&quot; and &quot;Constitution.&quot; </p><p>Although we are essentially a mining community, here in Como, yet we manage to get considerable excited on the subject of politics. - Last year the secessionists had it all their own way here, and a Union man was a rarity; but on the 2d inst., at our general election for Territorial and township officers, we came near beating them. As it was, it was a &quot;draw game&quot;; and this is about the only precinct in the Territory where the Copperheads had any show at all; we will give them more next year. The Territory went overwhelming for the Union, some precincts not showing even one Copperhead vote. The vote for a Constitutional Convention and formation of State Government, was also carried by a tremendous majority; so make room on the old flag for a new bright silver star, for the new State <em>Washoe, </em>will soon be asking a place among her sisters of the Union. </p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns32.jpg
Rockns33,"<p>Washoe Correspondence.<br />No. XXXIII.<br />Como, Palmyra District, N. T.,<br />Dec. 11, 1863.</p><p>EDS. MEMORIAL AND ROCK:-- </p><p>Since writing my last letter, things in this region have gone on in the same ratio of progression; every day bringing something new for the excitable population to talk about and wonder at. Murders and robberies are frequent, and in the big towns and cities they manage to &quot;have a man for breakfast&quot; pretty near every morning, as usual. On all sides, new mines are being daily discovered, and everyone who owns &quot;feet&quot; in those claims most noted at the present, feel rich until something turns up to mar the value of their stocks, when they feel poor, and perhaps sell out for the best they can and buy in somewhere else. The oldest and best developed mines are on the famed Comstock ledge at Virginia City, and they are nearly all paying good dividends; the Gould and Curry mine, for instance, paying on the 2d inst. their weekly dividend of one hundred and twenty-five dollars to the foot or share. That and the &quot;Spanish&quot; mine on the same ledge, are the best mines in the Territory, &quot;feet&quot; in that selling at $4500. None of the Spanish is for sale. On the 30th ult. the Gould and Curry Mills cleaned up 658 pounds of retorted amalgam from one day's run. The value of this amount is about $14,000. The clean up before this one weighed 590 pounds, and was worth $13,000. They have lately increased the capacity of the mill, by putting in additional amalgamating machinery. Heretofore they were unable to amalgamate as fast as their batteries would crush. </p><p>A Quartz Mill</p><p>The pioneer mill for this new district is now about finished, and to-day commenced running. In describing this mill I will try to give you some sort of idea as to what a quartz mill is. The &quot;battery&quot; consists of two mortars set side by side in a heavy frame of timber, placed on a foundation as solid as masonry can make it, each mortar being some six feet long by five feet high, and two feet wide, made of cast iron, and weighing a ton and a half each. Into these mortars a row of pestles, ten in all, are made to play; each pestle weighing 600 pounds. They are about the size of a cart-wheel hub, and a handle, or &quot;stem&quot; from each ten feet in length, and made of iron three inches in diameter, passes up through the heavy frame. These of course serve to guide and regulate the motions of the pestles, which are made to play up and down, alternately with each other, by means of cams. The quartz, reduced by hammers to the size of one's fist, is shoveled into an aperture in the side of the mortars, passing directly under the pestle or &quot;stamp,&quot; where, by the assistance of a small stream of water which is kept constantly flowing into the mortars, it is reduced to a sort of fine sand or powder, at the rate of twenty tons each twenty-four hours. It has to be crushed very fine before it can pass through certain very fine iron sieve plates, placed for that purpose in one side of the mortars. From the battery, this fine sand or &quot;pulp,&quot; is conveyed by means of troughs to a series of &quot;settling vats,&quot; where it is allowed to settle, and the water is drawn off. From the settling vats the pulp is taken and put into a series of amalgamating &quot;pans.&quot; This mill has six pans in all, each weighing nearly a thousand pounds. They are of cast iron, two feet deep, and about five feet in diameter. They are placed in a row, and in each of them a series of iron castings play round and round at the bottom of the pan, grinding the pulp to an impalpable powder. A quantity of quick-silver is mingled with the pulp, the amalgamation of which with the silver and gold is assisted by means of certain acids and chemicals diluted with water. When deemed sufficiently amalgamated, the pulp is transferred to large wooden tubs, with cast iron bottoms, which are in the form of bowls in the centre. These are called &quot;separators,&quot; the pulp in them being only stirred by machinery, allowing the amalgam frequently to collect and concentrate itself into the bowl in the centre. All this big lot of machinery, of which I have mentioned some of the details, is propelled by a splendid engine of forty horse power. - This mill when completed will cost nearly sixty thousand dollars and will keep at least a dozen men constantly employed, to say nothing of the miners it will keep at work quarrying out the rich ore. This mill commenced crushing with the main battery yesterday, but did not get into full operation until to-day. Everything works splendidly, and the mill is a perfect success. The rock now being crushed is not supposed to be very rich, but it is a good sort of rock to commence on. In a few days we shall begin to know something about how rich the claim about here will turn out. A great many strangers are crowding in here already, anxious to be on hand in time to secure a chance at the best claim and if the District generally turns out as rich as we all anticipate, there will be a tremendous rush here next spring, if not sooner. </p><p>Reese River</p><p>During the last summer and fall, there was the wildest kind of a rush to Reese River, about 150 miles east of here. Palmyra district was too near home. None of them could stop to look here at all, for their eyes were fixed upon the golden glories afar off. &quot;Distance lends enchantment to the view,&quot; and Reese River was the grand centre of attraction. Many went even from here. Big towns and cities sprang up as by magic in that far off region, and lumber and building materials brought most unreasonable prices; lumber brought as high as $500 per thousand. Food was scarce and dear, and teaming was profitable business on that route. </p><p>But the whole of it was based upon a large sized humbug. To be sure there were in reality very rich ledges there, and much of the rock was just &quot;lousy&quot; with pure native silver and gold; but the ledges the rich rock came from were all small, in fact they almost amount to no ledges at all, only being two or three inches thick on the average, and the enclosing walls are of hard granite, costing more than they are worth to quarry them out. Six mills were erected there, for on the strength of rich samples of rock and wonderful stories highly embellished, capitalists from San Francisco and elsewhere invested their money very freely, buying up claims and erecting mills. But none of those mills never did anything, except one little one of five stamps, which only run about half the time. The other had to lay still, partly on account of water, and also because but few were willing to pay a hundred dollars per ton for having their rock crushed. In fact they could not afford it, for the rock would not pay it. But still there were many chances for making money there. Those who were first there and had secured the best claims, made money &quot;selling&quot; out to the ones who came with much capital in their pockets. Whiskey and other necessaries sold very well there, and business of all kinds was good. The hotels and boarding houses could not accommodate half the rushing multitude, in fact house-room was so scarce that thousands had to sleep in the open air, exposed to the chill night wind and frosts. </p><p>“RULES OF THE HOUSE.”-- The proprietor of a Reese River hotel (according to Hoyle, who has returned) has posted up the following &quot;Rules and Regulations:&quot; &quot;Board must be paid in advance; with Beans, $15; without Beans, $12 ; salt free; Boarders not permitted to speak to the cook; no extras allowed ; potatoes for dinner; &quot;pocketing&quot; at meals strictly forbidden, no whistling while eating. Gentlemen are expected to wash out of doors, and find their own water; no charges for ice; towel-bags at the end of the house; extra charges for seats around the stove; Lodgers must furnish their own straw; Beds on Bar-Room floor reserved for regular customers; Persons sleeping in the Bar are requested not to take off their boots; lodgers arise at 5 A.M.; in the Barn at 7 o'clock; each man sweeps up his own bed; no quartz taken at the bar; no fighting allowed at the table; specimens must invariably be left on the outside; anyone violating the above rules will be shot.&quot; </p><p>But murder will out; and so will humbug. Men soon began to examine into things a little closer, and those who had invested their loose cash there, tried hard to get their cash back, by selling out to others. Shrewd people began to smell a large sized &quot;mice.&quot; - They began to perceive the &quot;sell,&quot; and their only hope now is to create an excitement again next spring, as they can, and then sell out of the scrape if possible. But the humbug has begun to explode, and the victims are hurrying back from there as fast as they went. All who went from here have returned, well satisfied to stay here in the future. There may be another rush, in a subdued form, to that region again next season; but none but greenies and sharpers will partake in it. It is reported that a big emigration from the States will set in for Reese River next season. If they do come there, they will come as strangers, and will be &quot;taken in and done for,&quot; accordingly. </p><p>We had bad luck with the iron-clad - the Camanche - that government sent up here for the protection of our harbor, for the ship Aquilla, which had her on board, sunk alongside the wharf in a heavy gale of wind soon after she arrived, and although attempts have been made to raise her they have been very unsuccessful thus far, but the Camanche will probably be saved in course of time. </p><p>The Constitutional Convention, now in session at Carson, are about bringing their labors to a close, and the Constitution which they have gotten up for our new State will soon be presented to the people for their acceptance or refusal. If they vote to accept of it, the next step will be the inauguration of a State government, and the asking of admission into the Union. The name decided upon for our new State is <em>Nevada. </em></p><p>Adios, </p><p>BEN BOLT. </p>",public://rock/Rockns33.jpg
Rockns34,"<p>Washoe Correspondence.<br />No. XXXIV.<br />Como, Palmyra District, N. T.,<br />March 5<sup>th</sup>, 1863.</p><p>EDS. MEMORIAL AND ROCK:-- </p><p>In one of my former letters I told you that this Territory was about to adopt a new Constitution, form a State government, and would apply for admission to the Union as a State under the name of <em>&quot;Nevada.&quot; </em>As you have probably already seen by the newspapers ere this, the sequel proves that I was mistaken in my calculation; for although the Constitutional Convention met at Carson, and got up about as good a constitution for our new State as any reasonable community could well ask for, yet when the test came on election day, the people rejected the aforesaid constitution by a vote of about five to one; so we remain in 'status quo' - a simple Territory. </p><p>The fact of it is, that upon mature deliberation we came to the conclusion that our Territory was too young, and hardly able to assume the responsibilities and increased expenses of a State organization, and then, too, one clause in the new constitution provided for the <em>indiscriminate taxation of all our mines, </em>which at once set the entire mining population dead against it. To be sure there are several very rich mines here, which are paying big dividends to stockholders, and those rich mines could well afford to be taxed; but the vast majority of the mines are in a very undeveloped state - mere prospecting holes. Instead of taxing such mines they should be left entirely free, and the miner should be assisted by all possible means to develop the hidden wealth of the country. When a mine has been fully developed and is <em>producing, </em>the product, either the gross or the net proceeds, might be taxed, but the mine itself should be let alone. The &quot;goose that lays the golden eggs&quot; should not be impeded in her praiseworthy occupation, but the eggs, after they are laid, might be taken with impunity. </p><p>Here in this district we are getting along finely, and the work of developing the mines is being vigorously prosecuted. It takes a vast amount of time, labor and money to develop a mine. A silver lead hardly ever pays at the surface, and it is only by means of deep shafts and long tunnels, laboriously excavated through many a strata of solid rock and hard cement, that the rich paying ore is arrived at. There are but few ledges here that are sufficiently well prospected to discover their true merits, but rich ore has been taken from some of them, enough to prove their being rich beyond a doubt, and arrangements are being made to open them out, and work them after the most approved style. But we need more mills, and will have them the coming season. The pioneer mill since I wrote you last, has been completed and put in successful operation, and is now busy pounding away both day and night, and is doing a fine business. It is crushing rock exclusively from the &quot;Whitman&quot; ledge, which keeps it constantly supplied, and could easily supply half a dozen other mills just like it. A large mill of eighty stamps is now contracted for, and is to be erected near the mine, for the sole use and benefit of that one ledge. This mill here has but ten stamps, and it crushes from twelve to fifteen tons each 24 hours, consuming about four cords of wood. This is but a common sized mill. </p><p>The Gould &amp; Curry mill at Virginia city contains I think eighty stamps, and they are about adding a new engine, capable of running 120 stamps, so that when all complete, these celebrated mining works will run 200 stamps. It will be, and is in fact now, the most perfect mill in the Territory, and their new engine will be the largest stationary engine ever built on the Pacific coast. The cylinder is 30 inch bore, and six feet stroke. The fly-wheel, which is intended for a three foot belt, is 18 feet diameter, 38 inches face, and weight 25,000 pounds. The total height of the engine from the floor will be 21 feet. The cylinder weighs 4,200 pounds, the main shaft and crank 6,800, and the total weight of the engine complete is 160,000. When working at its intended speed of 25 revolutions with 100 pounds steam pressure, it will exert a net force of 260 to 300 horse power. By itself, without boilers, shafting, etc., it has cost about $30,000, and it is now on its way over the mountains from San Francisco, where it was made at the Vulcan Iron Works. </p><p>The Gould &amp; Curry claim as you know is situated on the celebrated &quot;Comstock&quot; lead at Virginia, and from a late report of the President of that noted mining company, I glean a few interesting items. The ore is divided into three classes. The first class is estimated to be worth $2,800 per ton, and much of it is shipped to England for reduction, owing to its being rich also in metals, which cannot at present be worked so economically here as by sending to England. The second class, worked at the company's mill, yields about $320 dollars per ton, and the third class, crushed at various mills, yields about $60 per ton. The cost of mining the ore is about $3 per ton; of reducing, $38 per ton. Some faint idea of the amount of bullion shipped from this territory may be formed from the fact that for three claims at Virginia alone an average of about $200,000 is shipped in bullion. These claims are the Gould &amp; Curry, Ophir, and Savage. The Gould &amp; Curry sells at nearly $5,000 a share now of less than a foot each, and pays a monthly dividend of $150 per share. (Not bad to take, hey?) The Mexican mine adjoining the Ophir, on the Comstock ledge, is probably the richest mine in the Territory. It is a very small claim - only 100 feet - and was sold only a week or two ago to an incorporated body for the snug little sum of $1,360,000, averaging the respectable figure of only $13,600 per foot. The mineral wealth of this territory is certainly beyond any sort of competition; then, too, we must take into consideration the known fact that by the most perfect process now known and practiced, only about one half of the precious metals are saved, fully one third - and many estimating it at one half - being lost. Various chemicals are used in the amalgamating department, and many wise and learned heads are busy trying to study out some process by which this loss may be avoided. Untold millions depend upon the result. </p><p>This Territory is good for but little in the way of agriculture, being for the most part sterile and mountainous. In some few of the valleys, and favored spots, good crops of almost anything can be raised; but the past winter has been very mild and pleasant thus far, and the prospect is that unless we soon have some rain and snow the farmers will fail in their crop. The drought has been severe in California also, and the farming community are very despondent, especially in the southern portion, where the new grass has dried up, and cattle have been dying by thousands.</p><p>Society here in this Territory is good, considering, and on the improve. At Arizona the people lately in their sovereign capacity in the shape of the &quot;Vigilance Committee&quot; have had occasion to string up several bad men, and various other localities have followed suit. A Vigilance Committee is much needed at Virginia, where they would find a fine field for their labors. I think, however, that the organization really does exist there, and will be heard of at the first eligible opportunity. It was always found to be a very efficacious institution in California. I know that Aurora is now quiet, peaceable and orderly, which it never was before. The Vigilance Committee will keep it so. I am a true, loyal, law-abiding man; but having seen the real unmistakable benefits arising from the judicious action of Vigilance Committees on various occasions, I believe in them. This may sound strange to you in the 'land of steady habits,' but it don't sound a bit strange here, and you would think so, too, if you were here. You may think you wouldn't, but you would. In fact, you would become an active member of the Committee. That's so. </p><p>The road over the Sierra Nevada at the present time is represented by travellers to be extremely good; better than ever known of before at this season of the year, and the belt of snow is unusually narrow, so that the stages come through flying, making better time than they did last summer. Only a very small portion of the route is available for sleighing. For this reason heavy loads of freight come through daily, and the effect is to make provisions and goods of all kinds comparatively cheap. The winter has been more like an 'Indian Summer,' as a general thing here, and when we did have a little snow it all melted off in a day or two, except on the mountain slopes facing to the north. The deepest snow we have had was on the 31st of October. It fell to the depth of six inches on a level, and in some of the larger towns, Virginia for instance, the inhabitants indulged in sleigh rides. </p><p>Speaking of Virginia, I was over there a few weeks ago, and came across my old schoolmate and fellow Plymouthean, Ellis H. Morton. He was the same as he always used to be, short, fat and jolly. He is well situated in life, being married and settled down in a good paying business, in a good location on B St., where he and his estimable lady welcomed me, and entertained me, in a truly hospitable, home-like manner. His business is that of cider making. An odd idea I must confess, in a country where I have yet to <em>see the first apple tree, </em>to say nothing of orchards. He makes &quot;fresh Oregon cider,&quot; &quot;Newark cider,&quot; &quot;Champagne cider,&quot; and various other brands, and he does it all without so much as a smell of an apple-paring. It is made of sugar and water, tartaric acid, and hop yeast, variated and flavored to suit. It is a really fine beverage; of course not in the least intoxicative, and so nearly imitates what I used to suck through a straw thrust into the spile-hole of a barrel sometimes, in Old Plymouth, that I don't know as I could tell the difference. &quot;Morton's cider&quot; finds a ready sale everywhere and I really think he is a benefit to the human race in this quarter, in furnishing them with an article which supersedes in a considerable degree the use of vile, intoxicating, soul-destroying drinks. He is deservedly on the road to fortune. On his premises, he has besides his dwelling house, a fine stone warehouse, with extensive sleeping rooms in the second story for his hired men, &amp;c., a large bottling establishment, and a stable for his horses, as he daily runs wagons to different parts of the country, delivering his celebrated cider wherever it is required. Success attend him. He has striven hard and deserves a fortune. </p><p>A great many new discoveries of mineral regions and deposits are being made just now, and several new &quot;districts&quot; have lately been formed. <em>Immense beds of pure salt </em>have been discovered within the last few weeks in the alkali flats, between here and Reese River, which finds quite a ready market at the many quartz mills, where it is used extensively in the chemical separation of the ores. </p><p>Washington's birthday was generally celebrated throughout the Territory, as well as in California, for we are a right loyal people, and are going to vote for &quot;Old Abe Lincoln&quot; to stay in the Presidential chair for the next coming term. He is the very man for the position, and the country wants no other. We intend to vote for him, anyhow, whether he is nominated or not.

Rockns35,"<p>For the Memorial and Rock.<br />Washoe Correspondence.<br />No. XXXV.<br />Como, Palmyra District, N. T.,<br />July 18<sup>th</sup>, 1864.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:-- </em></p><p>Some little time has elapsed since my last letter, but owing to other duties interfering, the delay has been inevitable, and now I resume my correspondence, promising to do better in the future. </p><p>Since my last writing, times here in this Territory have very materially changed. At that period money was plenty and mining stocks were up and in a very healthy state. The famous Gould &amp; Curry mine, at Virginia, was selling at over $5000 per foot, and all other mines had their proportionate value. But suddenly we began to discover and experience great stringency in the money market, business of all kinds became much depressed, mining stocks fell lower and lower with a velocity that caused the eyes of everyone to project, until three weeks ago, when Gould &amp; Curry sold at $1500, and some reports say as low as $1250. Since then it has risen a little, and is now quoted at $1680 per foot. This being the leading mining stock, all others are depressed in proportion. The reason for the great depression of that particular stock is not even now apparent, for the mine was never in a more prosperous state, with no indication whatever of giving out, and the monthly product the same as usual. It is undoubtedly a &quot;bearing&quot; operation gotten up by brokers and other interested parties. A sort of panic, indeed, seems to have set in with regard to mining stocks, and &quot;feet&quot; in undoubtedly good claims, if offered for sale now, are regarded with suspicion and at once suspected of being &quot;wild-cat&quot;; and no wonder is it that such should be the case, for numerous are the victims that have been taken in and done for in the way of mining stock operations. The market last fall and winter was literally flooded with wild-cat mining stocks of all descriptions, and a severe lesson was the result to all who dealt in them, and the reaction has not only been fatal to all worthless stocks, but has also prejudiced the public mind to a great degree against even the good claims. This stock panic, however, is but temporary as far as the real legitimate mining interest is concerned, for a really good claim must always inevitably have its true value in the end. </p><p>This general depression in financial and mining affairs is not, of course, confined to this Territory, for it is the case throughout California and the rest of Uncle Sam's Pacific possessions. The laws of California, as well as of Nevada, prohibit the establishment of any private banking system of paper currency, and therefore we have never handled anything in the currency line but the hard coin, and being accustomed to it so long, a strong prejudice has existed against the introduction of the National &quot;greenback&quot; currency. But the present &quot;hard times,&quot; consequent upon scarcity of money, has opened the eyes of the people to the fact that they must cast aside their old prejudices and adopt the National currency in order to be on a financial equality with the rest of the Union. As the matter stands at present, many of our best claims are lying idle - for it costs a great deal of money as well as labor to develop a paying mine and &quot;prospecting&quot; is pretty much at a stand still. Real estate has also fallen to a very low figure, and in fact any kind of property has to be sold cheap in order to bring cash. This district is among the best in the Territory, but still of course we have to share in the general depression, and there is comparatively little doing here at present. The most prominent claims still manage to keep their work going ahead, but many have been obliged to suspend operations until times get easier. </p><p>The nomination of Abraham Lincoln and Andy Johnson for President and Vice-President of these United States was received with great rejoicing throughout the Territory, and we hope to be enabled to vote for them this fall. Another Convention is now assembled at Carson, apparently doing their best to form a Constitution for the State that we propose to erect this Territory into. I sincerely hope and trust they will be able to get up a Constitution that the people can accept of, although it would seem to be a difficult task, to judge from the success of the former Constitutional Convention, which, you may recollect, framed a Constitution which was rejected by the people by a vote of nearly five to one; and that same Constitution is now taken as a basis of operation by the present Convention. It certainly was a very good Constitution in many points, and in fact it would have been adopted, had it not been for one or two clauses in it which were objection able to the masses of the people. The most serious objection, however, was contained in Article 10th, which called for an indiscriminate taxation of the mines, and as the mining interest is paramount to all others in this god-forsaken portion of Uncle Sam's possessions, the Constitution with that clause in it was “tabooed&quot; at once by the entire mining community. The present Convention have been very busy for the last few days trying to fix up that identical clause, and have got it into nearly an acceptable shape. It is set down as the special order of business for today at 2 P.M. It will probably, at length, be so amended as to finally tax nothing but the <em>proceeds of the mine, </em>and not the mine itself, which is certainly the only true basis of taxation, considering that the mine, in reality, until developed, possesses but a fictitious value, and the labor and expense attendant upon the development of any of them is very much larger than most people have any idea of. In fact, by the time a mine has become opened out and brought into good paying condition, very few, if any, of the original claimants remain in possession, having been worked out, sold out, or as the saying is, &quot;froze out, &quot; long ago. Instead of taxing undeveloped mines, they should be assisted all possible until they can be made to pay, and then tax the product of them, if necessary. The goose that lays the golden eggs should be fed, and well cared for; her <em>eggs, </em>of course, might be taken with impunity. </p><p>The &quot;glorious fourth&quot; was celebrated with enthusiasm, both in this Territory and California, to the huge disgust of Jeff. Davis's dear friend s, who are scattered among us like tares among wheat; but they have to keep pretty shady and not demonstrate too much, for Uncle Sam's vigilant representatives watch them all with a jealous eye. Fort Churchill is situated on Carson river, about a dozen miles from here and very convenient to Virginia and the other principal points, so whenever any disloyal individual gives utterance to treasonable sentiments, he is at once arrested and taken to the fort, where he has to take the oath of allegiance and give bonds for his future good behavior or else be set to work &quot;packing sand,&quot; that is to say, carrying sand in a sack on his shoulders from one point to another until all secesh principle is completely worked out of his system. It is a very effectual mode of operation and is never known to fail. Gen. McDowell has arrived, and takes command on this coast, superseding Gen. Wright. He is very busily engaged inspecting the forts, arsenals and other public property coming within his jurisdiction, and it is said he will be even more strict with the secesh than was Gen. Wright. I hope so; they certainly cannot be too strictly dealt with. </p><p>Our Monitor, the Comanche, which was sent out here for the protection of San Francisco bay, and for so long a time after her arrival lay at the bottom of the aforesaid bay, was at length fully recovered, piece by piece, by the divers, and is now being put together. The ship Aquila, which brought her out here, has also been raised and fully recovered from her long immersion. </p><p>Our newspaper, the <em>Como Sentinel, </em>which started here some three months ago under such favorable auspices, has at length had to succumb to the stringency of the times, and last week moved away, press, types, bag and baggage, to Dayton, which being the county seat of this county, is probably rather of a better place for the paper than here just now. Another paper was about being started in Dayton, and as the county will hardly support two local papers at present, it was a measure of self-preservation on the part of the proprietors of the <em>Sentinel </em>moving thither and crowding the other paper out. They should have established their paper there in the first place, instead of coming here with it, for Como of itself alone never was able to support a newspaper; but when prosperous times come again, which they eventually surely must, a good newspaper will do well here. Printer's bills, like all other bills, are pretty difficult to collect nowadays. I am happy to say that I never fail to receive the Memorial and Rock regularly, and invariably read it through from end to end, advertisements and all, so I keep pretty thoroughly posted in regard to my old home and the doings of the people there, more so than I could by a score of letters. To me, as well as to any other son of Old Plymouth, it comes like the familiar face of a dear old friend, and is always welcome. &quot;Long may it wave.&quot; </p><p>Your friend, </p><p>A.

Rockns36,"<p>Washoe Correspondence.<br />No. XXXVI.<br />Como, Lyon Co., Nevada.<br />Sept. 23d, 1864.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:-- </em></p><p>The Constitution lately framed for our new State was submitted to the people, and on the 7th inst. it was voted for and almost unanimously adopted. I send you a copy of it, and think you &quot;or any other man&quot; can't find much fault with it. We hope to be admitted into the Union under that Constitution as soon as the circumstances of the case will conveniently allow the thing to be done, and in time to cast our vote for Lincoln and Johnson, which I tell you we will do, despite the prediction of some people that McClellan will carry Nevada as well as California. This prediction was based upon the result of the present election, which, in several counties, was carried by the Copperheads. The reason of this, however, was that the Union party was considerably split up and our enemies were not. This split was caused by the action of the Union Central Committee, who concluded, for once, to try an experiment in the political line. They gave out notice that in order to prevent the wire pulling and tricking usually attendant upon the old system of primary meetings and conventions, there would be nothing of the kind, but that all who were desirous of office should announce themselves as they saw fit, to the public, and each run &quot;independent.&quot; Now strange as it may appear, there were <em>several </em>who, although they didn't want office at all, yet were willing to sacrifice themselves upon the altar of public interest just merely for the benefit of the dear people. So they all &quot;entered&quot; for a grand scrub sweepstakes race, and the result was that in the newspapers, both weekly and daily, came out lists of candidates as long as your arm, in several instances half a dozen for each office. It was funny to see how many there were who felt themselves amply qualified to fill the various offices, and to reflect upon the number who were fully as eligible, but whose natural modesty prevented them from announcing themselves in the papers, or on big placards, as candidates for the Assembly, the Sheriff, for Recorder, and down to the smallest kind of a public office. Ah, you should have seen the big posters and broad handbills which beplastered every corner, doorpost, tree and prominent object throughout the County, announcing in big letters the names of the candidates and the offices they were desirous of filling. It made a capital job for the printers. And now the Committee found they had made rather of a bad move, and at the earnest solicitation of a numerous body of petitioners they concluded to rescind their action partially, and call a sort of Convention to nominate a <em>ticket. </em>So, still feeling that the people were incapable of selecting their own delegates to represent them, they just appointed a lot in each precinct, who of course met together with the committee and held a very harmonious convention and did things up according to programme. But did the people unanimously endorse such an irregular way of doing things? Did the people concentrate on that ticket gotten up by the committee? Well, they didn't. Did Copperheads take advantage of such a jolly state of affairs? Well, they did. And the consequence was, that on election day there were at least a dozen different tickets in the field, all claiming to be &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;regular,&quot; and the &quot;Democrats&quot; now claim a complete triumph, which they can do with impunity, and furthermore declare it their intention to carry the election for state officers, which, now that the Constitution is adopted, will be held in a few weeks. But the Union party are much the strongest, and the election will be united. We have learned a dear lesson, and will have no more &quot;experiments&quot; tried. The old system of primaries and conventions is open enough to wire-pulling and corruption, but not one hundredth part so much so as this idea of some three or four persons taking the whole thing into their own hands. </p><p>Things have been assuming more and more of a squally aspect of late. Secessionists and treasonable sympathizers are known to exist in abundance among us, but they are watched with vigilant eyes. Secret meetings are held by them, and we have abundant evidence that they are thoroughly organized throughout the Territory as well as in California. Confederate guerillas have already made their appearance and robberies have been committed by them. It is only a few weeks since the stage from Virginia was stopped in the mountains above Placerville by a band of them, who in the name of Jeff Davis robbed it of a large amount of bullion and the treasure of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.'s Express. They were immediately followed, however, and the whole country being at once aroused, they fared hard. Some of their number were killed. They killed the Sheriff and wounded others, but were pursued to near San Jose, where the final skirmish took place, resulting in the killing of more of them and the capture of the entire gang, who were taken to Placerville for trial. They were from about San Jose, and since then about a dozen other residents of the vicinity have been arrested, being implicated as accessories, and they are all now at Placerville on trial for treason, robbery, murder, etc. </p><p>Now having been long a resident of the immediate vicinity from whence all these men came, I happen to be intimately acquainted with nearly every one of them. In fact a year ago last winter, when I was engaged in copper mining on the Penitencia creek, near San Jose, I had several of them as partners in the business, and with John Clendewing, the most daring robber of the lot, and who was killed in the last skirmish, I ate and slept quite frequently, and hunted with him many a day. I can therefore attest from my own personal knowledge that they were nearly all Secessionists, although at that time they were very quiet. I really believe they were honest in their avowed purpose, and did really intend going to join the ranks of Jeff, and were only attempting to &quot;raise a stake&quot; to start off on. Well, they were in mighty bad luck. Every particle of the bullion and treasure was recovered. </p><p>I know of many men in good position at San Jose, who are known to be of the very blackest order of Secessionists and who, I have no doubt, knew of and assisted in the getting up of this guerrilla band; but they do things up pretty guardedly and are difficult to get hold of. John Clendewing was mortally wounded in the skirmish, and died the next morning in San Jose jail, very penitent and confessing everything. I knew him for four years as an honest, quiet, hard working man. He had a milk ranch near the copper mines, and made butter and cheese, and raised chickens for a living, and when he had time worked at mining. He was most undoubtedly led into this desperate undertaking by others far more culpable than himself, and most fearfully did a just retribution overtake him. </p><p>At San Francisco, our iron-clad Camanche is fast approaching completion, and will be ready to launch in November. A great many persons visit her daily, and from the admittance fee at the gate of the yards, a revenue is obtained for the benefit of the Sanitary fund, which at the time of the launch is estimated will have amounted to $15,000. The receipts have amounted to over $3,000 already.</p><p>J.C. Tucker, the celebrated jeweler on Montgomery St. failed a few days ago. Liabilities $500,000; assets, $50,000. </p><p>The Mechanic's Fair is in full session, and throngs of visitors, as high as 5,000 being present at a time.</p><p>Paul Julien, the greatest living violinist, has made his appearance in this part of the world, and together with a troupe of other celebrities are giving concerts in Silver land. They are performing at Virginia, to crowded houses.</p><p>The most terrific steamboat explosion that has ever occurred on this coast, occurred on the 5th inst. on the Sacramento river, about forty miles below Sacramento. The opposition steamer Washoe, from San Francisco, with some two hundred passengers on board, burst her starboard boiler, killing and injuring the greater part of her passengers. She was only about thirty yards from the shoe when the explosion occurred, and the steering apparatus being at once destroyed she took a sheer and ran ashore when she immediately sank, her stern only being submerged. The steamer Antelope being few miles behind, soon came up and took all the passengers, including the dead and wounded up to Sacramento, where the sufferers were at once taken in charge, and every measure taken that humanity could suggest to relieve their suffering, but most of them being badly scalded and having inhaled steam, have since died. Many other bodies have been recovered, and the steamer has been raised and taken to San Francisco, where she will be repaired, and in two months resume her regular trips. The cause of the explosion has not yet been definitely ascertained. Her boilers were recently inspected and pronounced in good order, and capable of sustaining a far greater amount of pressure to the square inch than was indicated by the gauge at the time of the explosion. The boiler that bursted, is concluded to have been defective, and no one is to blame, as usual. So you see we can never know when to feel safe while in the vicinity of a boiler full of steam. The deaths, so far as ascertained at present, amount to sixty-two, and others are expected to die. Some were probably lost in the river, as many yet remain unaccounted for. The passenger list was lost, and therefore it cannot be known precisely how many there were on board, but the number is estimated at two hundred.</p><p>Sam Wells, of the San Francisco Minstrels, departed this life on the 30th ult., at Virginia, where he, together with that celebrated troupe were performing, having lately arrived there from San Francisco. His death was caused by being thrown from a runaway horse, she was riding up from old Hill to Virginia three days previously. As he fell, his head came in contact with a post with such violence that the blood gushed from his mouth, nose and ears. Mr. Wells was born at Uxbridge, Mass, and was in the forty-first year of his age. He came to this coast in 1855, and his public career as an artist since that time is of general notoriety. As a professional, in his peculiar line, he had few superiors. As a man, he was beloved by his associates, and respected by all with whom he came in contact. Genial, social, frank, and warm-hearted, he was everywhere a favorite and a welcome companion. In the presence of a distracted wife and mourning friends, poor Sam closed his eyes forever. His last request was that his body should be taken to San Francisco, and buried at Lone Mountain cemetery; and that his Minstrel companions should follow him to his last resting place. In compliance with his wish, his heart-sick companions next day folded up their wardrobes and started for the Bay. Peace to the ashes of the Minstrel. He has gone to the spirit world, there to join the more perfect Minstrel band who sing around the great Throne of Light forever.</p><p> “After life’s fitful fever, he sleeps well.”</p><p>The Indian troubles which exist on the Plains, and impede the operation of the Overland Stage Co, apparently are extending this way. Last summer a wood-chopper was murdered while at his work about two miles from this town, and, various circumstances inducing the belief that Indians were the perpetrators, a party started out, which succeeded in mortally wounding one poor devil of a Pi-Ute Indian, who was immediately proven to be innocent and entirely ignorant of the murder. He has since died, and it is now within the last day or two ascertained that the deed was committed by three Washoe Indians with a view of getting up a war between the whites and the Pi-Utes. Winnemucca, the grand big chief of all the Pi-Ute tribe, came into Virginia day before yesterday, in royal style, with his family and attendants, creating no little excitement. This is his first visit, and in a regular speech, which was translated by one of his daughters who spoke first rate English, he told the citizens that the Indians of the interior were hostile and had endeavored to induce him to join them in a general war of extermination of the whites. He refused to join them, and they had declared him also to be their enemy and would kill him. Winnemucca is a fine hearty looking man of about sixty, and dressed as he was in a suit of old regimentals very profusely trimmed with lace and flannel and brass ornaments, and with his cap stuck full of tall feathers, a stick stuck through his nose and his face painted a fine brick color, he presented a peculiarly dignified appearance as he sat upon his war steed, surrounded by his suite. He was very gracious, and waved his hand and smiled in a kingly manner to the people as he passed along the street. He declares himself the true friend of the whites, and is coming to settle at Dayton, where he has a daughter married and living. Dayton IS the county seat of Lyon county, and is situated on the Carson river, ten miles from here, and eight from Virginia. The Virginia folks entertained him and his suite very hospitably, and, by passing round the hat both there and at Gold Hill, raised the old fellow quite a snug little amount of pocket change, which he graciously accepted, saying &quot;Bully boys” and proposed, or rather started, three cheers <em>a La </em>white man. It is almost to be hoped that the Indians of the interior may commence hostilities, for I know of about 3,000 men that would be pleased to walk into their affections, payoff old scores, and give them a lesson that they would remember for many a long year. </p><p>A.

Nov. 15<sup>th</sup>, 1864.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:</em></p><p>Moving On</p><p>By the dating of this letter, you will perceive that by the decrees of fate, and force of circumstances, I have again yielded obedience to the order to &quot;move on” like &quot;Poor Jo,” in Dickens’ “Bleak House.” But alas! so it has always been, and so it ever will be, individual members of the great human crowd eternally rushing up and down the walks of life, we may not pause too long at a time in any one place, to the obstruction of other passengers, lest the big fat policeman, &quot;Circumstances&quot; should tap us on the shoulder and again give us his oft repeated order to &quot;move on.&quot; Not that we should object to the order, however, &quot;variety the spice of life,&quot; and had we nothing to spur us along occasionally, would we not gradually subside into a state of supine monotony? </p><p>What would we know of the outside world were it not for those who are eternally &quot;moving on&quot; from place to place and sending us an account of what they see? Columbus the irrepressible navigator, would keep &quot;moving on,&quot; until he found a big new 6ontinent for the great Yankee Nation to &quot;move on&quot; to. Capt. Cook, would &quot;move on&quot; as a &quot;sea Cook&quot; until he found out whether the world was round or square, and Capt. Speke kept eternally &quot;moving on&quot; until he discovered the source of the great river Nile, which flows down through the country from whence came the wooly headed ancestors of those of whom our chivalric Southern brothers are so tenaciously willing to fight about. And now &quot;last though not least,&quot; as far as this communication is concerned, I, A.D. have &quot;moved on&quot; from Como to Virginia, the Queen City of the new State of Nevada. And here I remain, for a while at least, officiating for the present as local editor of the Virginia Daily Union, ruthlessly leaving Como to its fate, be it good or bad. The fact of the thing is, however, that Palmyra District, as well as all other districts outside of those whose mines were well developed and in paying condition before the present financial depression fell like a wet blanket upon our prospects, will have to bide their time. They will come out all right by and by; but it will probably be a couple of years before they are again as prosperous and going ahead, as they were a year ago.</p><p>Virginia</p><p>This city was commenced in 1859, about the time of the discovery of the great Comstock ledge, and for a time, during the prevalence of the great mining excitement, the population increased very rapidly until it reached nearly 30,000; but the general financial crisis came with crushing force, paralyzing all branches of trade and industry, until we have now only about 20,000 inhabitants. The city is built on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, only some half dozen miles up from the plains of the Carson river, and in full view of the vast interior Basin of the Continent, with its barren wastes of sage-brush, sterile, sandy deserts, alkaline plains, and bleak rocky mountains and hills, upon whose sides scarce a tree or shrub is to be seen. A much more desolate scene one does not often contemplate. Only some half dozen years ago the poor weary half-starved emigrant with his worn out cattle, as he passed through this desolate, unfruitful country, slowly dragging his weary way towards California, unable to find decent feed for his stock, wondered what in the name of Heaven, this unpromising, sterile, barren waste was made for. No one at that time thought it good for anything. But lo! what a change. The wandering adventurer, Comstock - came here among a few explorers, and prospectors for gold, and in the course of his examinations he happened to discover the richest and most extensive silver mine known in the world; a ledge, the extent of which is far from being comprehended, and in fact it is but merely prospected, as yet, the deepest shelf on it being but 520 feet in depth. Near this ledge, the miner's cabins formed the first nucleus for the present city, which in a short time extended itself far away down and along the mountain slope. It is laid out in squares, as nearly as the conformation of the country will admit of, and contains a vast number of fine brick and stone buildings, churches, and other public buildings, is supplied with water works, gas works, etc., and in fact is really a fine city, considering the age of it. Many of the buildings are four and five stories in height and finished off inside and out in splendid style.</p><p>Military</p><p>Just below the city, about a mile, is the head quarters of the Provost Marshal, where are encamped some 300 men, who are always to be relied upon in case of emergency. Fort Churchill is also only some fifteen miles from here, on the Carson river, where nearly a thousand men are always on hand; a new encampment called &quot;Camp Nye” is also established near Carson City, where they are building a Fort. </p><p>So you see we are pretty well cared for by Father Abraham, and traitors stand but little show among us. We have portions of the Provost Guard about the city all the time on the lookout for disloyal persons, and any one caught in the act, or complained of for spouting treason, is immediately arrested and forwarded to Fort Churchill, where he is set to earring bags of sand backwards and forward until he repents, and takes the oath of allegiance. This and other reasons, cause the numerous secesh and copperheads among us to keep pretty quiet. The companies stationed in this part of the country are principally, in fact about all - cavalry, and move with great promptness and celerity from one part of the country to the other when required.</p><p>Musical and Theatrical</p><p>We have two theatres here, in full blast most of the time, and all the theatrical and musical celebrities from your part of the world, and San Francisco, always give us a call. Six weeks ago, Paul Julien was here and fiddled tunes, the like of which us poor Pi-Utes never heard before; and three or four weeks ago Ossian E. Dodge gave a couple of his inimitable concerts, assisted by Wm. Hayward. From here they went back to California, for the purpose of visiting and seeing the wonders of the Yo-Semite valley and other scenes of interest, and then they were to return here, en route for Salt Lake and the States overland. How well do I remember Dodge, and the concert of his that I attended in Leyden Hall, Plymouth, some 15 years ago. He has dodged about the world considerably since, but he is the same inimitable Dodge that he was then.</p><p>Political</p><p>Well, at length I am in one the States of the Union again, and the bright silver star Nevada is added to the grand Union constellation. I had the honor of assisting by my vote, to make California State, and now I have the honor of assisting Nevada into the Union. And a true and loyal State, too, she is, for as you have probably learned long 'ere this, by telegraph, we went for Uncle Abe, strong; and so far, claim to be the banner State, for the largest Union majority in proportion to our total vote. The whole vote for the State, including the soldier's vote, will be about 11,000, and the Union majority, 3,200. And another thing, too, we can well afford to brag of: <em>Every officer, State and Legislative, is a sound Republican Union man. </em>The snakes many of them, are about to leave for Mexico, thinking justly that this is no good country for them.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>A.

Rockns38,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XXXVIII.<br />Virginia, Nevada, Mar. 10, 1865.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:--</em> Time flies on apace, and certain twinges of conscience have recently been reminding me that I am neglecting you, in allowing so much time to elapse since my last letter; but then you know the cares of this mortal world, and the absorbing pursuit of wealth often warp out best intentions, so here goes.</p><p>Mount Davidson</p><p>Prominent among the lesser mountains of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, stands the celebrated mountain with the above name, the elevation of whose summit is 7,253 feet above the level of the sea. It is a wild barren mountain, whose sterile soil bears nought but rocks and the everlasting sage-brush, which is the general characteristic of the country far and near; but although on the rough exterior of this old mountain nature has lavished but few of her charms, yet in its hidden depth, away down into its earthen bowels, are charms in the shape of stores of wealth, far beyond the computation of mortal man, beside which the wonderful stories of Alladdin, Monte Cristo, or any of those golden fancies, sink into utter insignificance. Some 900 feet below the summit of the mountain, and along the east side, is the far-famed vein of quartz, known as The Comstock Ledge. This is probably the richest silver mine for its extent yet discovered in the known world. From this ledge, to the summit, the mountain is very steep forming an angle of about forty-five degrees, but from the ledge downward, the descent is more gradual, and on this slope the city of Virginia is built, the streets - running nearly parallel with the ledge, and the uppermost one - A street - being close to it. This famous ledge has a &quot;dip&quot; or inclination to the east of 20 or 30 degrees as it descends into the bowels of the earth, consequently Virginia stands directly above it; in fact the Gould &amp; Curry Company sinking an immense shaft on D street which at the depth of 1,700 ft. perpendicular, will strike the ledge, should it maintain its present &quot;dip.&quot; The Comstock Ledge has been traced and is fully developed as to direction, for about three miles, and of course in time it will be traced much farther; but during that distance it occasionally appears at the surface, in the form of &quot;croppings,” or surface indications, and where it does not, it has been found by sinking for it to a greater or lesser depth. Its greatest width as far as is known is about two hundred feet from wall to wall. What I mean by &quot;walls&quot; to a quartz ledge, is the entirely different formation which encloses it on each side, generally consisting of a mixture of porphyry and granite. This Comstock Ledge, however, is an exception to other ledges as far as the east wall is concerned, this being composed of a very hard black or dark blue clay with glistening cleavage; and as to the depth of the ledge, of course no man is supposed to know, for the depth of a regular silver lead, as far as any one knows as yet, extends toward the centre of the terrestrial globe, or as far as anything can go. Along the course of the lead, numerous shafts have been sunk, the deepest of which is nearly 700 feet in depth. Over each of these deep shafts of course heavy machinery worked by steam has to be erected adequate to the task of hoisting the immense quantities of rock and earth, and pumping the water from the mines below; and these being erected at short intervals all along the ledge, at morning, noon, and night, the shrill piping of the steam whistles of the numerous quartz mills and hoisting works, produces an effect quite confusing to a novice in such things. The large body of quarts in this ledge, does not all pay alike, maintaining a uniform degree of richness throughout, by any means. It consists of barren rock, poor rock, pay streaks, etc. The &quot;barren rock,&quot; as its name indicates, contains little or none of the precious metal, and the &quot;poor rock&quot; is scarcely rich enough to be remunerative, while the &quot;pay streaks&quot; are the places where the best ore comes from, which pays all the way from $20 to $10,000 or more to the ton. Anything less than $20 rock is considered rather poor. All the richest rock, that which pays from say $1,000 upward, is sent to Europe to be worked, we not having the appliances and ability as yet here to successfully compete with the established metallurgical arrangements of the olden world. The precious metals exist in the ore in bromides, chlorides, sulphurets and various other chemical combinations, as well as in a native state. &quot;Feet&quot; or &quot;shares&quot; in this celebrated lead, range in value, from $100 to $3,000, according to location, company, prospects, &amp;c; as for instance, in the Mexican claim a foot could be bought for $10,000; in fact there is none of it for sale. It costs a vast amount of money to bring any one of those veins along the ledge, into a healthy dividend paying state, but several of them are now paying a monthly dividend of from $75 to $100 per share to the fortunate stockholders.</p><p>Boiler Explosion</p><p>Where there are so many mills and so much machinery driven by steam power, it is natural to suppose that explosions might be quite frequent, but although we have no regularly appointed inspector of boilers, and have all sorts of engineers and men who pretend to be such, yet somehow we have escaped any very serious calamities in that line. Last Tuesday morning, however, the boiler of the hoisting works at the Ophiz mine burst with a heavy report that shook the houses in the city and wakened many people out of a sound sleep. The engineer, James Cameron, was instantly killed, and two other men who were standing near were considerably cut and bruised, and one of them had his, arm broken. The building was blown into fragments, and the brick work surrounding the boiler was sent with terrific effect at the houses in the vicinity; one dwelling only about fifty yards distant looking as though it had been subjected to a severe bombardment, the whole side of it being completely riddled with the brick projectiles. One end of the boiler was blown down town some 300 yards, and crashed down through the roof of a dwelling, while about half the boiler, with all the tubes attached, weighing several tons, was blown over a hundred yards directly up the side of the steep mountain. The furnace doors, grates, and other iron work were distributed through other houses in the vicinity, but fortunately no one was injured. An inquest was held on the body of the engineer, which was concluded yesterday, and the evidence went to show that the boiler was unsafe, and was so considered for some time before the explosion. A new boiler was already placed in position and about being connected with the engine; in only twenty-four hours longer the old boiler would have been dispensed with. It had been leaking badly for some time, and the engineer in order to stop the cracks, had put into it a mixture of bran and manure, which is said to be quite efficacious in such cases. This produces a foaming sometimes, and in trying the cocks he is supposed to have mistaken the indications to have been that there was plenty of water, so that next time he let in the usual supply of cold water, it came upon a red hot boiler; hence the explosion. Only ten minutes before, the steam-guage showed sixty-five pounds of steam to the square inch. So you see those who toil about the mines are not always safe, even above ground. They may not get blown up, but they may fall down a shaft, or over an embankment, get caught in the machinery, or meet with some such accident. </p><p>Down in the bowels of the earth, hundreds of feet below the surface, tunnels run in all directions, connecting one mine with another all along the Comstock, and one may travel for miles, visiting one busy crowd of workmen after another, and see them lustily swinging the pick among the rich ore, or employed setting up the huge timbers and securing as far as possible against dangers from caving earth. In each of these tunnels a track is laid, and cars run in all directions, conveying ore to the various shafts, where a small platform about four feet square is in waiting to receive them. This platform is called a &quot;cage;&quot; it is attached by iron frame-work at the sides to the heavy hoisting rope, or cable, and by means of iron &quot;guides&quot; which run from top to bottom of the shaft at each side, kept well oiled, the “cage” runs perfectly true and safe, and takes the loaded car to the surface with its ton of ore in a decidedly speedy manner. Few people in this city have any definite idea of the under-ground streets and villages that exist immediately beneath them in the depths of the earth, and of the number of those whose glimpses of daylight are extremely limited. And few are they who realize the fearful frequency and magnitude of the dangers to which the hardy miner is exposed. To describe a tithe of them would fill more paper than there is in this letter. The most extensive of these dangers is in the caving of bodies of earth, to which of course all mines are subject. To illustrate, I will cite a case in point.</p><p>Cave at Gold Hill</p><p>Last Sunday morning an extensive caving of earth occurred at Gold Hill, in some of the mines on the Comstock at that point, which is about a mile from here. The ledge being particularly rich there, it had been taken out completely for the distance of some 300 feet in depth from the surface, leaving the entire hanging wall supported by heavy timbers, which, however, when the earth started to cave, were no more than so many straws in the way. It is a comparatively easy matter to prevent a body of earth from starting, but when it does start, nothing short of solid material can stop it. You will remember that the ledge inclines to the east, therefore the “hanging wall” is the body of earth of hillside which hung over the ledge, or rather the excavation, after the ledge had been taken out. The cause of the cave was the earth becoming saturated by the melting snows. Of course the filling of such a cavity was accompanied with a fearful crashing of timbers and a heavy rumbling and jarring, similar to an earthquake. The earth at the surface, for the extent of eight or ten acres was much cracked, the fissures being from a inch to two and three feet in width, and some six acres were sunken more or less to the depth of two and three feet. This body of earth however, only filled the &quot;old workings&quot; of the mine, between which and the &quot;lower levels&quot; or present workings, in a body of the ledge, seventy-five feet in depth which is poor rock, and left for this reason, which prevents the lower levels from receiving any injury. There were about a hundred men at work in the miners at the time, and they were of course terribly frightened, the great concussion and rush of air, caused by the sudden advent of such an immense body of earth, blowing out all lights, and throwing men, cars, planks, &amp;c., in all directions. Fortunately no one was hurt, but all made their escape out through the neighboring mines. Two of the engine houses were badly racked, and the machinery displaced by the sinking of the earth; two or three of the shafts were somewhat crowded and the sides sprung in by the eave, but no permanent injury was done; in fact, on the whole, the cave was a benefit, for there is now no chance for another just like it, and the old workings are filled safely and securely up.</p><p>Into the Depths</p><p>Monday afternoon I was at the scene of the great cave, “taking items,” and at the “Imperial” mine. Finding they had repaired their shaft so that two loads of workmen had succeeded in passing down into the mine, I valiantly concluded that as I had seen the length and breadth of the cave, I would now go down and see the depth of it; so availing myself of the kind permission of Mr. Buckminster, the gentlemanly Superintendent, I stepped on the “cage” with him, accompanied also by my friend the enterprising and undaunted J.D. Andrews, and away we went down, down, into the pitchy darkness, now swiftly gliding with a sucky smoothness and anon rubbing hard through some place crowded by the caving earth, fetching up with a sudden jerk, at the end of the stout rope as we passed the obstruction. Suddenly we rubbed harder than ever, and came to a full stop. We were stuck fast. Just think of it! Three hundred feet from the surface, and nearly the same distance from the bottom. Was the shaft crushing in, and going to nip us in that tight place? We didn't know what to say or do, no more than an unborn babe. We had no light; therefore could only appreciate how we felt personally. Buckminster reached the bell-wire, but it would not work. He shouted up the shaft, for them to hoist a little. Then we could feel the rope tightening and straining, and next thing up we went with a sudden jerk. At another command we went down again, but in the same place stuck faster than before. We jumped up and down, but 'twas no go. The Superintendent now, after a little examination in the dark, found we were at &quot;the three hundred feet level.&quot; Again the engine tugged, and the big rope was strained like a fiddle-string. What if something should give way, - the cage pull apart - or something of the kind happen, and we get spilt down the shaft? How would our mother's boy fare then? I kept a &quot;stiff upper lip,&quot; or at least tried to do so. 'Twan't me that was scared. Oh, no, twas Andrews. And now, zip? up we suddenly jerked, and all of us hopping about the cage, &quot;like peas in a hot skillet,&quot; and again down we went with a terrific rush, this time successfully plunging past the &quot;tight place,&quot; and in another moment were safely landed at the lower level, where we found lights and company, and were much rejoiced thereat.</p><p>The Mine</p><p>With a firm step we now intrepidly followed our conductor through the various drifts or working tunnels before us, candle in hand. He showed us the big streak, seventy feet in width, from which all the pay ore comes which is taken from the mine; and there too we saw the hard, black shining clay which forms the east wall of the Comstock ledge; an unmistakable and peculiar formation. We followed into a drift which is being run to the west, but has as yet developed nothing but a formation of quartz and porphyry. As far as is known, the entire ledge at this point, including the barren portions is about 150 feet in width. We noticed with particular approbation that this mine was very strongly and judiciously timbered, and the places where the ore was taken out, were carefully filled in with waste dirt. If all parts of the mines were thus filled in and secured, there would be rather of a poor show for caves. I should have taken infinite pleasure in exploring and observing more of this mine, but my thoughts could eternally revert to that big body of caving earth above, and I wondered in my coward heart if the shaft had grown any smaller while we were down here. All my solicitude, however, was on account of Andrews, who was in my care, you know, and has got a family. At the mouth of a drift I found my old friend and brother miner of Como, Thompson at work. I was hugely glad to see him, and astonished him with the warmth of my greeting. I asked Thompson how long he had been down there. He laughed, and said, “always;” “that was his residence.&quot; I believe the scamp was &quot;chaffing,&quot; and that I saw him go down the shaft just before we did. Just then some one sung out to us &quot;Cage is ready,” so we jumped aboard, and with a swift rush, several rubs, and a strong jerk past the “tight place,” making the big old rope sing and snap, we hopped safely out of the mouth of the shaft into the broad light of day, and the welcome prospect of snow and sage-brush once more. But you must be thinking this will do for the present. I think so, too, and will quit.</p><p>A. D.</p>",public://rock/Rockns38.jpg
Rockns39,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XXXIX.<br />Virginia, Nev. July 11<sup>th</sup>, 1865.</p><p><em>Eds. Memorial and Rock:--</em></p><p>The Glorious Fourth</p><p>Has come and gone, but in the hurry and bustle consequent on the preparations for and celebration of that grand national day, I came near forgetting you, but you see I have not. We celebrated the day here with far more than usual spirit in every sense of the word, as is shown by the records of the police court the next day, although the officers were as lenient as their conscience would allow, and took none to the station house except those who were disorderly as well as very drunk. The procession numbered about a thousand persons, as only the fire department, military, and a few of the civic societies turned out, the citizens generally preferring to act the part of spectators, or to go into fun on their own book. For its size, it was the most beautiful procession I ever saw in my life. There were three companies of military marching proudly with their fine uniforms and gleaming muskets and bayonets. Our efficient fire department followed, numbering nearly five hundred men, in the usual sanguinary red shirt, and fireman's hat, their seven machines beautifully trimmed with flowers, wreaths, flags, etc., and three of the machines bore each a live Goddess of Liberty, dressed in appropriate costume, with helmet, shield, pole with liberty cap on it etc., and mounted on a platform over which were erected splendid canopies of red, white and blue silk, profusely trimmed with flags, rosettes and all that sort of thing. Then came numerous carriages, finely decorated, followed by a grand car of States containing thirty six little girls, dressed in white, each with a wreath of flowers on her head, and a little American flag in her hand. The car itself, was a large boat appropriately painted and decorated, with a beautiful awning over it, and the name, Nevada, on the stern . This car was drawn by eight horses, as was also the one following it which contained thirty-six more, similarly attired and arranged little girls, representatives of our public school. As these cars passed along, all the little girls waved their flags and sang patriotic songs. More carriages, and delegations from different societies on foot followed, and to the rear of the procession was brought up by twenty-seven Piute warriors, mounted, and bearing their flag, which is simply the American ensign, with instead of the stars on the blue Union, two white arrows and a tomahawk. At their head rode their great war-chief Winnemucca, in his &quot;peace&quot; paint, that is to say all one side of him - the left side - was daubed in a lovely manner with red ochre from the top of his shaggy top-knot, down to the soles of his moccasins, making him look considerably more like the devil than he does naturally. His horse was adorned in the same way. The right hand side of this formidable chief being thus illustrated, with black paint, would indicate &quot;war to the knife and knife to the hilt,&quot; sock the tomahawk into your skull, peel your head, and all that sort of thing, without judge or jury, or benefit of the clergy. In the procession were borne numerous flags and banners of great beauty, some of them costing as high as $500, being made of the heaviest silk, with gold bullion fringe and tassels, and the stars embroidered on the Union, in gold and silver thread. There were also several fine bands of music, performing the most soul-stirring national airs. Never till my dying day, shall I forget that procession as it passed down C street though the heart of the city, the band playing, and the military, fire department, and all, singing that glorious popular song of &quot;marching through Georgia,&quot; in which they were joined by the dense crowd of spectators which lined the sidewalks and balconies on both sides of the street. It was a scene that one beholds rarely more than once in a life-time, and a feast to the soul of every true patriot. The procession marched to Maguire's Opera House, where the usual exercises of reading the Declamation, Poem, and Oration were held. In the evening there were fireworks, a grand ball, theatre, several eligible private fights, general knock-downs and other patriotic demonstrations, but I believe no one got badly hurt, except by bad whiskey, and on the whole, it was an excellent celebration.</p><p>The Inevitable Nigger</p><p>Or &quot;them damned niggers,&quot; or &quot;the bloody niggers,&quot; which are the other names by which persons of African extraction are familiarly known by certain classes of our people who are so particularly sensitive in regard to the small amount of dignity they happen to possess that they have a holy horror of the contamination of the negro's company, and are always prating against “negro equality,&quot; unmindful of the fact that they will one day sing with them in heaven or roast with them in hell, all on the most familiar and sociable footing of perfect equality and intimate connection - the inevitable nigger, I say, was the innocent cause of a general disagreement of the programme in many places, especially in San Francisco, deterring many from turning out in procession who would otherwise have done so. In this city they were not invited to participate, therefore the question of dignity among the scrub-stock and snobs was not brought to the test, although they freely expressed the determination “not to turn out at all if the niggers did.&quot; But that sad calamity was averted, by the niggers remaining in their natural obscurity and allowing the Indians to take their places, at which no offence was taken. In San Francisco, however, the dark-skinned, ivory-toothed, wooly headed sons of Cain were impudent enough to ask the privilege of walking in the same procession with white men. Not in front, as on the battle fields of the South, but at the extreme rear, where in the dust raised by their white predecessors, their obnoxious color might be hidden or obscured so as not to be so aggravatingly prominent to the sensitive dignity of the krout-eating, bog-trotting, hash-slinging, German, Irish, French, and English plunkeys in the procession, who, never being allowed any dignity on the other side of the water, put on the greatest airs and scollops when they become “Americans,” and in fact assume at times to dictate to the free American people as to how they shall act. Side by side the white man and the negro fought, bled, and died on the battle fields of the south, and now that the war is over, and the great day of jubilee has come, the black man begged the privilege of rejoicing with his white brethren, not as an equal, but simply as a servile descendant of a race of slaves. They did not ask to march in front, with bright muskets and blue uniform, reminding people of the fact that their race had borne those muskets, and worn those uniforms on the battle field, and without disgrace too. They simply asked the blessed privilege of bringing of the rear of the procession. Well, this was accorded to them, and what a hub bub it created. The result was two processions; one composed of the chief military officers of the country, city officers, two or three fire companies, and societies and associations of men of weight and responsibility in society, with the horrible niggers in all their blackness marching in the rear, with heads uncovered, and grinning one broad universal grin, the happiest, proudest set of poor devils in the whole wide world, while those composing the other procession were principally firemen an those whose small stock of dignity would not allow of a wasteful extravagance of the article such as would be incurred in walking with the niggers, like Gen. McDowell and the other big officers and city dignitaries. Pshaw! Out upon such clod-hopping, krout-eating, hash-slinging flunky dignity.</p><p>Patriotism</p><p>When the news of Lee’s surrender arrived, this whole excitable city went as “mad as a March hare.” All the bells were rung for six hours, and guns and everything that could make a noise were brought into requisition, old men danced like children, and waved their hats and hurrahed till their old throats were hoarse. Everybody went wild drunk with joy, for well they knew the war was now ended, and the long prayed for peace had come at last. </p><p>Only a week later, and all the flags were draped in crape, at half-mast, one building after another was hung with the symbols of grief and the whole city was in mourning. Men stood in knots about the corners and along the sidewalks, conversing in low but eager and excited tones that boded no good to traitors, or those who approved the foul deed of the black-hearted assassin. Every saloon and place of business was closed, and no man seemed to know what to do or how to act, but the deep under current of determination was apparent, and woe be to the traitor that should dare raise a voice of rejoicing over the hellish deed. The old men now were the most excitable, and with bared heads, and tears in their eyes, they cursed the hand that had stricken down the Savior of his country - Abraham Lincoln. Yes, men walked the streets with weapons of death in their hands, seeking but for a reason to use them, and the military companies assembled at their armories. Well was it that secessionists and traitors &quot;haunted their holes&quot; that day. Well was it that their mouths were dumb, for had a collision once taken place in Virginia, it would have ended in a fearful fight of extermination. At Gold Hill, one fool of a fellow did dare to express a word or too of rejoicing at the assassination. All that saved him from immediate death was the thick stone walls of the jail, which however was soon broken into and the trembling wretch dragged forth by the infuriated populace, who would have hung him at once, but wiser counsels prevailed, and he was tied to a stake and soundly flogged. He will bear the scars to his grave. A placard was then fastened to his back, labeled &quot;A traitor to his county,&quot; and he was being marched to this city in the midst of the mob compelled to carry the American flag at half­mast, when he was rescued by the Provost Guard, who took him at once to their head­quarters. Heaven help him if he had ever reached here, he would have immediately adorned a lamp post. He was taken to Fort Churchill where with some half a dozen others who had dared to &quot;shoot off their mouths&quot; in other parts of the country, he was compelled to do hard labor in all manner of menial services for several weeks, and at length released on taking the oath of allegiance. &quot;Thus ever with traitors.&quot; All is quiet enough now, even secessionists are glad the war is over, and copper­heads are all the soundest kind of Union men. Hang Jeff Davis by all means; he has got precious few to mourn for him in Nevada. That last money stealing, petticoat operation of his, lets him out, even with most of those who were his friends.</p><p>Indian Troubles</p><p>The Indians of the Plains, and along the Humboldt, have been rather troublesome for some time past, but they have been pretty much whipped into submission. A bit of a war is now apparently about to be inaugurated between the Piutes and the Washoes, from two of the former being killed near that city last week by some of the Washoes. The Piutes swear vengeance and are mustering in their armies, and sending all their women and children to Fort Churchill, out of the way. Meanwhile the whites look on like the woman whose husband was fighting the bear, and like her &quot;don't care which whips.” No more now.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>A.D.</p>",public://rock/Rockns39.jpg
Rockns40,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XL.<br />Virginia, Nev. Oct. 29<sup>th</sup>, 1865.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:-- </em>The world continues rolling round, as usual, with every evidence that it will continue doing so for some time to come, although this portion of it is 1n a high state of fermentation just at the present time. The grand political cauldron is in a fine state of ebullition, and will be kept so for the next week by reason of the numerous aspiring candidates struggling for the various State and County offices. New exciting and extensive discoveries of quartz ledges, rich in gold and silver, are daily being made in various directions, and the old Sierra Nevada is being more prospected this season than ever before. But first of all I must speak of </p><p>The Great Earthquake</p><p>Which visited California on the 8th inst, about 1 o'clock, P.M. It was decidedly the sensation of the season, and by far the heaviest of the kind known since the occupation of the country by Americans, although the natives tell of a great earthquake which happened some fifty years ago, so violent as to shake down all the houses. San Francisco suffered most from this recent shock. It was Sunday, and the churches were all filled with people. There were two shocks. The first one was comparatively light, yet caused the building to vibrate with a terrific cracking noise. This was followed in a few seconds later by a far heavier shock than the first, which threw down portions of houses, chimneys, fire walls, etc. In fact, many large brick buildings were so badly racked and broken that they will have to be torn down, as being unsafe. Not more than half a dozen lives were lost, but the loss of property and general damage by this earthquake is estimated to amount to nearly a million of dollars. Many people were more or less injured in the frantic rush from the churches, as well as by jumping from windows, or being struck by falling bricks, etc. Two women also actually died from fright. The two shocks only lasted some half dozen seconds, which everybody in San Francisco agrees was plenty long enough. Of course, queer scenes were enacted during this short &quot;reign of terror,&quot; and many people did exceedingly extravagant things. But then, that's to be expected on such occasions. This earthquake extended for hundreds of miles along the coast and did more or less damage in San Jose, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and other towns and cities. In many places, the earth opened and water gushed forth. Some rivers whose waters were low, are now swollen to four times their former size, and many wells were dried up totally or the water in them increased in quantity. Several other slight shocks have been felt since the big one, but not being &quot;any great shakes,&quot; they excited but little fear, other than to cause people to get up and go to bed again after shivering in the streets or backyards awhile. The prospects of San Francisco are somewhat injured by this big shake up and scare, but yet, after all, people are getting so well used to those little tribulations, that they don't mind them much, and after the excitement of the thing is over, and damages repaired, all will go on as before, until the next big shake.</p><p>Earthquake in Nevada</p><p>The earthquake mentioned above did not extend very far inland. It was felt at Sacramento, and even along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, but not on this side at all. This city is situated nearly three hundred miles from the coast, and having the big mountains between here and there, all the earthquakes we have will be got up on our own hook. I have been over here some two years and a half and have felt no shock of an earthquake as yet, neither can I find any one that has, although the Indians tell of a great earthquake which occurred in this region some thirteen years ago, at which time they say the earth got &quot;very sick,&quot; and shook &quot;a heap;&quot; and that near Pyramid Lake great cracks opened, from which water was spouted nearly one hundred feet high. Several landslides also occurred, which are now pointed out by them as having taken place at that time. Earthquakes are not common in mining regions, though they often occur at no great distance. This is a very satisfactory fact to us here in Nevada, for were such earthquakes as that which recently visited San Francisco common in our mines, it would make mining a far more perilous business than it is now. Shafts, tunnels, chambers and levels would be shaken into a common chaos, and the huge timbers now used to support the sides and roofs of these labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, would crumble up like so many pipe stems, the honey-combed mines being shaken into a solid mass, causing instant death to the many hundreds of miners now constantly employed in them. They are not wanted here; no, nary earthquake, if you please.</p><p>Terrific Steamboat Explosion</p><p>Misfortunes are not liable to come singly, but whether the earthquake could have anything to do with a steamboat explosion which took place four days afterwards, I cannot say. It is sickening to think of such horrible catastrophes, and the terrible frequency of their occurrence. Men, women and children in one fell instant blown into eternity, flayed alive, limbs torn off, eyes destroyed, and all the foul horrors attendant upon one of these awful explosions, wherein &quot;no one is to blame,&quot; unless the engineers are killed, when of course the fault is laid to them. </p><p>About 6 o'clock on the evening of the 12th inst., the fine steamer Yosemite exploded her boiler at Rio Vista, on the Sacramento River, on her way from San Francisco to Sacramento with about 200 passengers on board. The whole of the upper forward portion of the boat was destroyed, but the hull was uninjured. Over one hundred persons were either killed outright, or have since died from their injuries. The boat had touched at Rio Vista, and after a stoppage of some six or seven minutes for the landing and receiving of passengers and freight, she was backing out from the wharf, when the explosion took place. The engineer, who strange to say, was not injured, declares that the boiler was at the time of the explosion blowing off steam, under a much less pressure than the maximum allowed, and he can give no other reason for the explosion than that the boiler iron was defective. The coroner's jury in the case, exonerated the officers of the boat from all blame, and added, &quot;We further say that whatever wrong may be attached to any parties for the disaster, should be attached to the company for using such iron in their boilers.&quot; The iron used appears to have been English iron, which is considered of inferior quality to the American. Well, the dead now sleep in their coffins, or are feeding the fish in the river, and the wounds of the living are healing, and this terrible accident with all its concomitant horrors is fast receding among the things of the past, its harrowing scenes and effects to be remembered until some fresh atrocity of the kind overshadows it in the public mind.</p><p>Excelsior District</p><p>Since I wrote you last, I have taken a trip over the summit of the Sierra to see the newly discovered District of Excelsior, and returned from there six weeks ago. This District is about twenty miles square, and comprises the whole upper end of Nevada County, California. It was discovered last spring, and has since created an excitement almost without parallel on this coast. It is situated about seventy miles west of this city, and high up in the tops of the Sierra, on the California side of the summit. It is near the line of perpetual snow, or rather I should say, within the limits, for I found many an old snow bank there from last winter, and more has fallen there several times since I returned. There are a very large number of gold bearing quartz ledges within the District, from two to fifty feet in width, and some even wider. Many of the ledges are very rich in copper, but none of them contain much silver. The gold exists in its native purity disseminated throughout a very dark rusty looking quartz, which owes its color, probably, to the great quantities of iron obtained also within it. The principal town there is called Summit City, and when I was there it was only five weeks old, yet it contained about a hundred wooden houses, well built, many of them two stories high, and a population of nearly 1500 people. It seemed the work of magic, as it indeed was, for the magic power of gold will accomplish anything, almost. The country is of a naked granite formation, very rough indeed, and mountainous, of course. It is well timbered with tall pines, firs and tamaracks, and well watered with numerous lakes and streams of the purest of mountain water. Several mills were building for the reduction of the ore, and next season the real richness of the District will be developed. There will be but little done towards it this winter, as the snow piles up there to the depth of from ten to twenty feet. I saw pieces of gold in the rock, from the size of a pin's head, to that of a filbert. I went out there to see the District and report upon it according to its merits, and in pursuance of that idea, during the ten days I was there, I clambered over the whole of it on foot, looking at each and every one of the ledges and sending back a letter to the paper every day, giving about two columns of a description. It was a rough old job, and pretty snug work, too, I want you to understand. The richest ledge in the District was discovered some four weeks before I got there and was just opened. It is called</p><p>The Enterprise Ledge</p><p>The ore is a peculiar species of quartz, resembling a light colored sandstone and contains gold, iron, nickel, cobalt, a little antimony, and a very small quantity of silver. A fair test has been made by milling quantities of the rock both in this city and in California. It will average about $300 to the ton, that is to say, the surface rock does than, and it is expected to be richer as depth is attained. Some of the ore has been sold at the mine for $2 a pound, or at the rate of $4,000 per ton. It promises to be the richest mine ever discovered on this coast, and perhaps in the world. The rock is perfectly &quot;lousy&quot; with little fine particles of gold, so pure that its assayed value is $19.75 per ounce. A large mill is being erected near the mine, and in the course of two months will be crushing the ore. This claim is 1500 feet in length, and already has created such an excitement, that notwithstanding it is so little developed, enormous sums of money are offered for it. The stockholders, however, will not sell, and the only sale made thus far of any portion of the claim was made yesterday, when five feet of it was sold for $1,000. It will be worth at least $1,000 per foot by spring, as it will be worked from now henceforward, more or no more. The ledge is forty feet wide that is kown of, but how much wider is not ascertained. It is probably sixty or seventy feet wide. It will make a big stir in the world at no distant day, to judge from the indications, although there never is any &quot;sure thing&quot; in mining.</p><p>A Miraculous Escape</p><p>A little boy only two years and five months old, living with his parents at the upper part of this city, strayed away from home last Friday morning about 9 o'clock, followed by a half grown Newfoundland dog, and within an hour disappeared altogether. Search was made for him by numerous people. The police were on the alert, and in the evening the city crier with his bell went through every part of the city announcing the loss. All night and all the next day the search was continued. All the old shafts and such like places were examined one after the other, but without success; neither the boy or his pup were to be found. At length, about 7 o'clock Saturday evening, the father of the of the boy in the course of his weary search entered an old tunnel in the mountain side. About 150 feet from the tunnel's mouth he came to a perpendicular shaft which was sunk some years ago. Hopelessly he shouted down the shaft, and to his utter surprise he was answered by a faint moan, and he recognized the voice of his child. Wildly he rushed out for assistance, and soon he had a score of willing hands to assist him. One noble fellow volunteered to go down. A rope was procured, and making a sling at the end of it for his foot, he was lowered hand over hand into the depths. Wonderful to relate, he found both the boy and his dog alive. He took the little fellow under his arm and was drawn out, and afterward some one else went down and rescued the dog. By actual measurement, I ascertained the shaft to be <em>one hundred feet in depth</em>. The dog was not hurt in the least, but the left side of the child's head was badly contused and swollen; one of his little knees was also much bruised, but singular to say, <em>not a bone was broken</em>, and he is in a fair way to entirely recover. I don't think such a case has a parallel anywhere. The little fellow is visited by hundreds. He is considered a hero, and his dog has become a lion. I'll bet that if forty dogs were deliberately dropped down that same shaft, it would kill every one of them. He must have grasped the dog as he found himself falling, and so pulled him down into the depths with him.</p><p>Political</p><p>The copperheads are making strenuous efforts to carry this State at the election which comes off next week, but they can't do it. The newspaper with which I have been connected for over a year past in the capacity of &quot;local editor&quot; took a notion last week to &quot;flop” over tote copperheads for a certain monied consideration, and I took the liberty to “flop” also. I don't belong to that paper any longer. The cops can't buy<em> me</em>. I am now acting in the same capacity on the Territorial Enterprise, a truly loyal Union paper, and shall continue for some time, unless it also “flops,&quot; which it won't do.</p><p>Yours truly, </p><p>A.D.</p>",public://rock/Rockns40.jpg
Rockns41,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XLI.<br />Virginia, Nev., April 19, 1866.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:</em></p><p>April Fool Day.</p><p>Being the last great holiday observed here, in this land of sage-brush and silver ledges, except Sundays, which are always celebrated in a great measure as such, among all Christian nations, I will speak of, by way of commencement to my letter. Not because it was the commencement of the month, particularly, or that I should have commenced this letter long before that date; but because I saw more people made &quot;April fools&quot; of by means of all sorts of foolish devices on that occasion, than I ever did before. First thing in the morning, in the local columns of the Enterprise, there appeared a very innocent looking, but somewhat startling item, to the effect that a large female cinnamon bear, with three cubs, had just been captured near the sink of Carson River, some twenty-five miles from here, by a couple of soldiers belonging to Fort Churchill, and brought to this city about 9 o'clock the previous evening, en route for San Francisco, and placed temporarily for safe keeping in a small building at the rear of Piper's saloon, which is a prominent place of resort in the heart of the city. The details of the capture were given, and the item wound up with giving the weight of the bears. The old she one weighed 1,300 pounds, and the cubs, which were but two months old, weighed 1,100 pounds each. Now the item looked reasonable enough, except that cinnamon bears always live in the mountains, and never fool away their time out in the deserts and plains. And then too, no one ever saw a bear of that species weighing half so much, to say nothing of those &quot;hefty&quot; little cubs; yet no one person in a dozen stopped to consider such points, but rushed up bald-headed to see &quot;those bears.&quot; It is estimated that nearly a thousand persons, including several ladies, go thus humbugged. Passing through the saloon and opening the rear door, the <em>bear</em>-faced sell was made apparent, and shouts of laughter assailed the victims as they came out. Of course the saloon keeper did a very good business, for most of those who got sold took it in good part, and &quot;stood the drinks&quot; manfully. Some men came several miles to &quot;see the bears.&quot; Then, too, there was an old scalaway of a Piute Indian, going begging round town, with a folded paper in his hand, which regaled the unsuspiciously benevolent who opened the document, with the following legend: &quot;Youse an April fool, and the greenest kind of a d---d, long-eared donkey, at that; please give me two bits.&quot; Of course few could withstand such a heart-rending appeal to their generosity, and accordingly, to this warrior who called for &quot;quarter,&quot; they gave it, and the heart of this fiery, untamed savage waxed exceeding glad at the continual increase of the funds in his treasury, while his four squaws followed in his train, subduedly rejoicing in the good fortune of their dusky lord and master. But yet, much good it didn't do them either, for the old ring-nosed, ham-colored old scrub, contrived, before dark, to allow himself to be cleaned out of every cent of it by two or three of his fellow warriors, at a quiet game of &quot;draw poker,&quot; in a vacant lot near the outskirts of the city, which the Paiutes use as their gambling saloon, and to do them justice they imitate the virtues of their pale-faced brethren very well, in the playing of an excellent game of poker. Indeed, some of them are said to be hard to beat at that game. Our victimized savage has not been able to understand as yet why it is that his magic document won't bring him in a cent since the first, but on the contrary is productive of nothing but an occasional kick, instead of quarters. </p><p>It was not advisable on that day, to attempt to pick up a piece of money apparently dropped by some one on the side-walk, or on a floor anywhere, for it was sure to be nailed fast, and bogus at that; or it had a concealed string to it, and would suddenly disappear just as your hand was nearly upon it. Old Hats, placed in tempting positions, inviting a kick from passers by, were certain to have half a dozen bricks or a big stone concealed under them, as several deluded experimenters testify to their sorrow. I often feel glad that I was not born on the first of April, for I should be sure of being always in doubt as to my identity, thinking whether or no my mother hadn't been &quot;April fooled&quot; someway, and some ordinary scrub of an infant substituted for my real self, thus compelling me to assume a false position in society ever afterwards. Yes, and who knows but that I might even have turned out a pickpocket, chicken thief, burglar, copperhead, or even a member of the legislature, all in consequence of such substitution? Ugh! the very idea of the thing is terrific to contemplate. Why I have a friend in this city who is over thirty years old, and yet had his vote challenged at the last election by an Irishman, on the ground that he was not old enough; and all because he happened to be happened to be born on the 29th of February, 1836, and this Mick had heard him remark once that he had only seen eight birth-days. Mick was right enough, however; but parents ought to bear these little inconveniences in mind. A day sooner or a day later would be all right.</p><p>Politics</p><p>Since the close of the war of the salve-holders’ rebellion, everything in the line of politics has been comparatively quiet, although the people of Nevada always take a lively interest in the doings at Washington, and we certainly do realize the great advantage of the overland telegraph, for we get the news about as soon as you do from Washington, and therefore are as well posted in Congressional affairs as you are. Nevada has ever been truly loyal, and a clause in her constitution declares that all States owe paramount allegiance to the general government, and that no State has a right to secede from the Union. At the general election last Fall, the poor copperheads never got a taste of anything but defeat, although verily their souls did hanker &quot;muchly&quot; after the loaves and fishes of office. As I said before, they never got even a taste, neither will they at the coming city election on May 7th. We've got them right where we want them, and mean to keep them there. We uphold Congress, and don't go much on old Andy Johnson. If he had pardoned less and hung more of those throat-cutting bush-whackers, the whole country would have been better off, and the work of &quot;reconstruction&quot; very much facilitated. He would be doing about the right thing, and would recover some of his lost laurels even now in the estimation of Union men, here, if he would only just string up Jeff Davis for about half an hour. It would have a beneficial effect on the reconstructing of that old hook-nosed rebel chief. But then, after all, when we come to take a critical survey of the real status of the case, the Southern people have always had their own way in everything. They chose to be ugly in Congress, and talk bad to the other side of the house, and they were suffered to do so. They chose to make the Yankee members angry, and were suffered to do so. They chose to call us all &quot;nigger-worshippers,&quot; &quot;abolitionists,&quot; &quot;slave-stealers,&quot; and dastardly cowards generally, of whom one common-sized chiv could whip five, easily, every morning, by way of exercise, before breakfast, and they were suffered to do so. They chose to keep niggers, buy and sell them, work, eat and sleep with them, and in fact go in for the most intimate kind of &quot;negro equality,&quot; by mingling the races and infusing their high-toned blood into the veins of the black race, thus elevating the African at the expense of the Anglo Saxon, and they were allowed the blessed privilege of doing so. Look at the mulattos, quadroons, octaroons, and other degrees of races commingled, and there you see the true personification and actual illustration of &quot;negro equality,&quot; about which they prate so much. Rut they would not be satisfied with miscegenation; they would have the negro free, so they stirred up one difficulty after another, and finally a big war, by means of which the negroes were freed pretty fast. They were told by the good and great Abraham Lincoln at one time, that if they would only lay down their arms within a certain specified period, they might keep what slaves they had left; but no: they were bound to free the last nigger, or get whipped, and they were suffered to do both. But they've not got enough yet: they will have their own way. Not satisfied with emancipating the negro, they are now bent on giving him the right of suffrage, and in order to force the Yankees to terms in the matter, they send nothing but blood-stained rebels to represent them at Washington in the Congress of the nation. Ah! there's where they've <em>got</em> us. We will have to knuckle to them yet once again, and the day is not far distant when we shall have to proclaim universal suffrage. Then, and not till then, will the South be represented by loyal men, and the United States be bound firmly together in one common bond of brotherhood, &quot;one and inseparable&quot; through ages to come. Yes, if they will force matters, and insist on having the whole loyal negro race in the South allowed to vote, and take an active, controlling part in the election of the rulers of the nation, in the name of Andrew Jackson, Anthony Wayne, Ethan Allen and old Miles Standish, let them have their own way. After this is done, send plenty of school-teachers down South, missionaries we may say, for the conversion of the heathen portion of that population, - the poor white trash, etc. Establish everywhere free schools, and educational institutions for the benefit and alleviation of the whites, leaving the negroes to work out their own salvation in that respect, with perhaps a little assistance, and believe me, the new lights and humanizing influences of education will do more towards refinement, amity of feeling, and consequent united power and advancement as a nation, than legislative enactments can do in all coming time.</p><p>Mineralogical – The Comstock Lode</p><p>The mines in the immediate neighborhood of this city are confined principally to the great and far famed Comstock ledge. This famous lode is being worked for the distance of about four miles in length. It is found to have a general &quot;dip&quot; or inclination east of about 42 degrees down through the surrounding strata, and is now being worked to the depth of over 700 feet perpendicular measurement; some shafts will attain a depth of 1000 feet this fall. The lower levels of the mines along it, are at the present time yielding as rich ore as ever, and in greater quantities, and there is every reason to suppose the ledge to be inexhaustible and extending towards the centre of the earth. In places it is nearly 400 feet in width. There are numerous other ledges of much smaller size hereabouts, but none of them are found to pay, as yet. The general yield of the Comstock ore is from $20 to $100 to the ton, although some of the richest yields $10,000 or more to the ton; such ore however, is not so very plenty. Ore that goes less than $20 per ton does not pay, with the present appliances and machinery, although we have as good as there are in the world.</p><p>Excelsior District</p><p>This district is destined to become of much note in the world, by reason of its many rich gold-bearing ledges. It was principally discovered last summer, but owing to the shortness of the season, it was not much developed before the heavy winter snows fell and impeded all mining operations. It is situated on the western side of the summit of the Sierra Nevada, on the Henness Pass route, the regular stages between here and Sacramento passing directly through the southern portion of the district. It is within the borders of Nevada County, California, and is about 20 miles square, well watered, and heavily timbered, but they being so near the summit of the Sierra, snow remains in places all the year round. I was over there last September, reporting upon the district, and in my perambulations among the mines, cooled my tongue with snow from many a snow bank, although at the same time I was wearing a linen coat, and sweating from the heat of the sun. About 150 persons wintered there, but since the opening of spring, the population of the principal town, Meador Lake, has increased to over 400, including many families. A grand rush will be made for Excelsior within the next two months. There is about nine feet of snow there on a level, at present. It was rather of an open, poor winter for snow, otherwise there would have been about fifteen feet there, yet notwithstanding this great depth of snow, the atmosphere is so tempered by the sea breezes from the Pacific, and the balmy air of the valleys that it is not so cold there as it is here, where the deepest snow of the past winter was only a foot in depth. In fact it is much colder in Old Plymouth. The Pacific railroad will be completed across the Sierra in two years from now, and will pass where the stages do at present, through this district, which is well named Excelsior, for I believe it will prove the richest yet discovered on the coast.</p><p>Pahranagat District</p><p>This district, which has been recently discovered, lies away in the extreme southern portion of this State, on the Colorado river. The ledges are said to be small, but rich in the precious metal. The State lines, on the east and south, have been recently extended, so that the extreme south embraces a small portion of the Colorado at a point which it is said to be the head of navigation. By reference to a map of that portion of the country you will see where the river Virgin empties into the Colorado, at which point the Colorado takes a sharp turn to the southward. This is the point of which I speak, which is considered quite an important one to this State, for being the head of navigation on the Colorado, it gives us direct water communication with the Pacific Ocean, by means of this river, and the Gulf of California, and freight to Salt Lake, Reese River or the southern part of this State can be landed there in Pahranagat, saving an immense amount of land transportation. Pahranagat is distant about 500 miles from this city, and between here and there, as you can see by the map, lies a large unexplored region of country; a tract embracing some 250 miles in extent of the southern part of the State. It is as far as known, about as barren and utterly sterile a scrap of country as lies out of doors anywhere, being pretty much destitute of water, wood or vegetables. It includes Death Valley, so called by reason of a party of men who perished there in trying to explore its desert fastnesses. Some two weeks ago, the Governor of this State ­ Gov. Blasdell - started with a party of some thirty persons, escorted by a company of cavalry, and well provided with everything necessary for their arduous journey, to explore this unknown region, and go through if possible to Pahranagat. They were last heard of four days ago, by means of a regular correspondent of the Enterprise who accompanies the expedition. They were then on the borders of the great unknown, and had sent scouting parties out ahead, who reported finding no water. The Governor also writes back, saying that there appears to be so many difficulties and dangers in the way, that he may have to take some other route. He goes to see for himself of what advantage to the country this important point on the Colorado really is or can be made. Pahranagat Valley is said to be small but fertile, as well as rich in mines, and a town is already started there. But we shall know more about it when the Governor gets back.</p><p>Montana, Ho!</p><p>With the first starting in of spring, large numbers of ambitious people started out for the far-off territory of Montana, which the map tells you is in the Rocky Mountains, near the source of the Missouri River. Rich reports, and a few lucky persons coming in from there with lots of gold, induced this exodus of the floating population; but the excitement is pretty much over, and the rush has subsided. Rich placer mines undoubtedly exist there, same as were in California, but the season for working is very short. The sun in winter lies to a great depth, and the frost is so very intense that the mercury not only freezes, but men are often found frozen to death there. This winter weather is said to last for about eight months in the year, and the most comfortable places to be found there, are in heavy log houses with big fireplaces and plenty of wood, or in dwellings excavated in hillsides. Decidedly an uncomfortable prospect for an unmarried man. Well, whatever may be the real truth of the matter, it is most undoubtedly rather of a hard old country to reside in, let the mines be ever so rich.</p><p>New Granada, Ho!</p><p>About the same time that the rush commenced for Montana this spring, exciting news also came from New Granada. The richest kind of placer gold mines were reported to have been discovered there, on the Barbacoes river. Straightway and forthwith, numerous of our most excitable fortune seekers shovel their clothes into their old carpet sacks, and the next steamer from San Francisco took them down to Panama, on their way to the land of promise. </p><p>The mines in question are situated about 300 miles south of Panama. An English steamer plying between Panama and Lima, twice a month, touches at Tumaco; fare - cabin $45 - deck $25. From Tumaco 150 miles up the river, you go in canoes, pro-<em>poled</em> by big naked buck niggers, to the town of Barbacoes, where the mines are. </p><p>This town contains two or three hundred houses, built of bamboo, leaves, mud, etc., and raised on poles, to get out of the way of the snakes, scorpions, mud, and such like commodities. It rains there every night, but the temperature only varying a few degrees from infernal hot at any time the year round, no sides to the houses are required - nothing but a floor and roof. They get into their houses by means of ladders; so when a man desires to lock up for the night, all he has to do is simply to pull up his ladder after him. </p><p>The whole country is described as being covered with an almost impenetrable tropical undergrowth, so that a person has to cut his way through, wherever he goes. The mines are on the western slope of the Andes, but as to how rich they are, is the great question at present. Two friends of mine, both reliable men of much practical experience, who went down there, have just written back. One of them says it is the richest country he ever saw, and considers his fortune made. He speaks in glowing terms of the stores of wealth within the grasp of any energetic American who will take hold of any portion of the mines and work them, and says the country is a very agreeable one to live in, healthy, temperate, etc., etc. My other friend says it is the cussedest country the Lord ever made, and not fit for a white man to go to, much less live in; deadly unhealthy, malarious, damp, but a few degrees cooler than Tophet, knee deep in snakes, centipedes, tarantulas, scorpions, jiggers, and other little atrocities, to say nothing of vampire bats with bellies that hold a quart, which light on a poor fellow who happens to be unsheltered, and suck him dry in a short time, as far as blood is concerned, leaving him like a lemon that has been subjected to the squeezer. The mines he denounces as a big “bilk,” and the whole excitement to have been erected by a few speculators. Now, hang me if I know which to believe. One of them certainly lies like &quot;Tom Pepper,&quot; but which is it? The story of the last one is corroborated by several others, so that I am inclined to believe him, bats and all; but then again, they all say there is one rich placer gold mine there being worked, which yields numerous pounds of gold, daily; and such being the case, there must by all rules of reason and common sense be other mines there just as good. Well, time will tell. But I must draw this long-winded letter to a close. I have perhaps strung out on it too long, but I was trying to make amends for past neglect.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Alf.</p>",public://rock/Rockns41.jpg
Rockns42,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XLII.<br />Virginia, Nev. May, 13, 1867.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:--</em> Time rolls on; and the days, months, and years, like so many chips, still go ever floating onward, ceaselessly borne on the bosom of the great broad tide which empties into the illimitable sea of eternity. The mighty Mississippi still pours its vast volume of many stenched waters into the blue Atlantic, Hobbs' Hole Brook and Eel River continue to contribute their aqueous torrents towards the general good and welfare of this mundane world, as they did in ages past, when ye gentle savage roamed undisturbedly in all his primeval innocence along their grassy banks, fishing for trout and herrings; and so, too, I in course of time resume the thread of my somewhat chronic correspondence. (How's that, now, for a starter?)</p><p>Political</p><p>I am pleased to be able to say that our juvenile state of the silver star - Nevada - still remain politically sound. There are, it is true, many copperheads and disloyal men dwelling among us, but they stand no more show of obtaining a controlling interest in the affairs of the country and the nation at large, than they did during the dark days of the rebellion. Political trickery and combination has occasionally smuggled a copperhead into office, but less now than formerly. At our county election three or four months ago, we elected good Union men to the various county offices, which for the last two years had been filled by copperheads elected through an unfortunate though temporary split in the Union ranks. A few days ago we held an election for city officers. The copocracy were out in full force, and we had a good square fight of it, but we shipped them handsomely, the entire Union ticket being elected by between two and three hundred majority, with the exception of the Mayor who was beaten by nearly that much of a majority. The secret and explanation of this strange result, is simply that the Union candidate for Mayor was a very unpopular man, injudiciously placed upon the ticket, while his antagonist was a very popular one, receiving, <em>consequently, strong support from the Union ranks</em>. The whole thing was so palpable that the Democrats did not claim it as a victory at all on their part. There was a time, only a few weeks ago, when they did claim a victory, and copperhead stock rose high in the figures everywhere on this coast. This was when the result of the election in Connecticut was flashed over the wires. The cops waxed jubilantly hilarious over the disgraceful news. In San Francisco, Sacramento, Stockton, yea even in Mud Springs, they fired ecstatic salvos of artillery or anvils in their affluent rejoicings. Confound them and their news! Don't you think Connecticut <em>ought</em> to be expelled? What do they think they are doing down there? If they don't do a little better next time, the loyal people of Washoe will see that Connecticut is scratched off from the map of the United States - rubbed out altogether.</p><p>Religious</p><p>There is a great revival in religion progressing here in this city at present, the greatest ever known or thought of in the land of sagebrush. It was inaugurated a week ago yesterday, since which time they have run it mighty strong in the way of daily and evening services, prayer meetings, and all that sort of thing, all the churches of the city uniting in common cause together. Rev. A.B. Earle, a great revivalist preacher from your section of uncle Samuel's big ranch, is the instigator of all this religious commotion. For several months past, he has been operating in California and Oregon, creating a big religious furore wherever he has set his stakes for the purpose. He proceeds systematically to work, with programme arranged according to allotted time, and the way he brought the “web-foots&quot; of Oregon, or the farmer folks in the California “cow counties'' down upon their marrow bones and elbows, was truly jolly to contemplate. He corralled the sinners by scores, by fifties and by hundreds, bringing them to a realizing sense of their iniquitous proclivities and consequently to repentance. Even in some of the mining towns he made numerous converts, and caused many a hardened case to gather himself into the fold of the faithful, and like Topsey, to exclaim, “Oh! golly, I’se so wicked.&quot; Here in Virginia, however, Mr. Earle has not met with near so good success thus far as he anticipated or that his success elsewhere, as heralded in all the newspapers far and near, seemed to warrant. He finds us an unusually worldly-minded squarely practical, common-sense dealing people, and expresses himself as considerably discouraged at the immediate result of his arduous labors in behalf of our spiritual welfare, although his meetings are constantly well attended, the church being filled to overflowing. Last Evening (Sunday) he preached to an audience of between six and seven hundred, and many left, unable to get into the church. I have attended and listened to all his sermons thus far, and was generally well pleased with the majority of what he said, but on this occasion I must confess to a great degree of disappointment, notwithstanding this was previously announced and anticipated as his best effort. His subject was &quot;The Unpardonable Sin.” This he represented to be the failure on the part of every one to come forward, sit in the &quot;anxious seats,&quot; and at his bidding kneel, pray, and otherwise signify their full and complete acceptance of Christ, resigning all the sinful pleasures of the world for the service of their Redeemer. This rejection of Christ he distinctly gave his hearers to understand was demonstrated by all who obstinately kept their seats and did not come forward when he called upon them to do so. This was the unpardonable sin which God neither would, nor could forgive, and all such sinners he stated would be infallibly and hopelessly consigned to hell. Now this proposition may be all well enough in its way, but its terrible, uncomfortable and unsatisfactory, unless one merely looks upon it as simply Mr. Earle’s opinion, and lets it go for what 'tis worth. Allowing he is right, the figures in the matter would sum up about thus: The population of this city is supposed to be about twelve-thousand, including numerous Jews, Chinese, and others who do not believe in Christ at all, therefore are a dead loss to start on. Of the Christians, Mr. Earle will probably succeed in converting - in his way - to Christ, nearly or quite two hundred - no more than that. According to his theory, these are to be the only ones saved, consequently all the rest of the twelve thousand are bound to roast. Allowing that Mr. Earle has succeeded in converting and saving ten thousand people on this coast, and ten times that number in the Atlantic States, in view of the many hundreds of millions of - to him - unconverted sinners there are in the world, Hell will be pretty well crowded, and Heaven a decidedly unpopular place. Indeed, accepting Earle's illiberal, narrow-minded theory as true and conclusive, the chances of getting into Heaven are insignificantly small as to be not worth contending for. Notwithstanding his eccentric and peculiar views on the subject, however, Mr. Earle is evidently an earnest, sincere, true-hearted worker in the Lord's vineyard, and he deserves the best of success in whatever he promulgates that is right. He continues his revival during the present week, at the expiration of which time he goes on his mission elsewhere. There are probably many sinners here who will yet come forward and &quot;experience religion&quot; under him, among whom even I, case-hardened as I am, may be included, notwithstanding my present view of the situation, &quot;for while the lamp holds out to burn,” etc.</p><p>Mineralogical</p><p>The great and far-famed Comstock ledge, passing and situated immediately beneath where I am now sitting as I write this letter, continues its enormous yield of the precious metals - principally silver - as in the past. It supplies some eighty mills with the requisite ore to work, the yield being about 1600 tons per day, from which the yield of bullion averages $25 per ton - $40,000 per day; $1,200,000 per month of thirty days; $14,600,000 per year - luscious and desirable figures for a poor man to ponder over, ain’t they? Nearly all this vast amount of bullion is from only a small extent - less than a mile - of this ledge. It is worked for a distance of three miles or more, but it only pays in favored localities. The past winter was a very severe one, the snow in this city being at one time from three to five feet deep in the streets, so you may be sure we had some of the gayest old sleighing imaginable for a while, but the closing week in April brought with it the finest of spring weather, which still abides with us, consequently prospectors and miners interested in the development of outside districts, who have remained housed up with us all winter are now starting out daily in some di­rection or other on their regular spring expeditions. Silver Bond, or Philadelphia District, situated in Nye county, two hundred miles east of this city, is attracting much attention at present. It was discovered and some of the ledges opened out last season. Considerable silver bullion is already being brought in from there. Wilson's and Washington districts, situated on the forks of Walker river, some ninety miles south-east from here, were discovered last fall and winter. In the first-named district, the ledges are very small and narrow, but rich in gold, with but a slight proportion of silver. Washington district contains several good-sized ledges of silver ore which is said to be very rich. Both these districts are also attracting quite an emigration thither, and are anticipated to yield well, as soon as properly developed, and with the requisite mills erected for the reduction of the ores. I feel sure that there are already mines of silver and gold discovered within the borders of this State enough to last for the next seven hundred and twenty five years, to say nothing of the new discoveries still constantly being made.</p><p>The Railroad</p><p>The Great Pacific railroad is progressing at a highly satisfactory rate, and within three years it will extend entirely across the continent, uniting the Atlantic and Pacific ocean with a band of iron which may never be broken. From Sacramento the road was completed last fall ninety-two miles to Cisco, a small town within fourteen miles of the summit of the Sierra Nevada, when the deep snows of winter stopped all further operations at that point, and a force of about 2000 laborers, principally Chinese were transferred to this side of the mountains below the snow line. The snow is rapidly disappearing now, and the work of grading, etc., is consequently much facilitated. In the course of two months, fifteen miles of the track will be laid, from the lower portion of the eastern slope, at the California State line, towards the summit, and by the time the winter snows fall again, the cars will be running entirely across the Sierra Nevada. Progress farther east will be comparatively easy, the country being of a level character, and the mountain ranges lower and easily passed. The main tunnel at the summit of the Sierra will be completed in September next, and will be 1,700 feet in length, there are three other tunnels of the respective lengths of 400, 350, and 200 feet, each tunnel being made wide enough for a double track. Thus it will be seen that the great question of the possibility of a railroad across the Sierra Nevada is already practically decided in the affirmative, yet from the experience of the past winter, I anticipate that it will be found a very difficult matter for the cars to cross the mountains with any degree of regularity during the prevalence of the deep snows in the most elevated regions. The snow falls there to the depth of from ten to twenty feet, therefore all familiar with the operations of a snow plow on a railroad, can easily realize the difficulty of keeping the track clear in a region where snow storms are a daily occurrence, and furious winds drift the snow already fallen, into all roads, tracks pass-ways and crevices, filling them up at short notice. Stage routes are all right in that respect, for the sleighs pass over the snow with the utmost facility, regardless of the depth, making fully as good travelling time as in midsummer. Thus, for weeks at a time last winter, our travelling communication with Sacramento was completely cut off, by reason of the deep snows preventing the cars from running on the most elevated section of the road; (5,000 feet above the level of the sea,) yet the balance of the route, from the terminus of the rails to this city, by sleighs and coaches was all right. The telegraph informs us that the eastern portion of the great railroad is progressing in this direction with great energy and rapidity, the rails being laid at the rate two and a half miles per day - not a particularly high rate of speed for a locomotive, but fast time in railroad construction. That portion of the road was also considerably obstructed by snows last winter.</p><p>Telegraphic</p><p>This telegraph is certainly the greatest and most wonderful contrivance known of in the world. Time and space are literally nowhere - annihilated - wiped out. We know here all about what they are doing in London just as soon as the cockneys themselves do; yes, even sooner we may say. For instance, owing to the difference of latitudinal time, should Smith &quot;butt Brown in the snoot,&quot; near the Queen's palace, we receive the full account with all the aggravating particulars, by telegraph, and have it published in the evening papers some hours before the thing has happened at all, or the pugilistic Smith has even begun to wax belligerent. In fact we are even better posted as to the New York and Boston news that you Plymoutheans are, for we read them every morning in the daily papers, and you don't. Speaking about news this is a glorious country to make up a newspaper in. We have plenty of exchanges, all prolific and constantly pregnant with matters of interest, and the local department is always very readable, containing items in profusion relative to new and exciting discoveries, sensational accidents, choice robberies, elopements, rich mineral yields, etc. Our readers however, in addition, require a goodly supply of blood-curdling news items every day, such as will induce their eyes to protrude with horror, and their hair to rise on end in a healthy manner; single murders, double suicide, whole families with throats cut, aggravating rapes, sensational seductions, wholesale burglaries, bank robberies, startling rascalities and all that sort of thing. For these we scissorize our eastern exchanges and never fail of a plentifully desirable supply to suit all. Why bless you, we are a much more moral, decent, peaceable, and upright people than you of the Atlantic side. When we do manage to dish up an original shooting or cutting scrape, a big dog fight, a stage robbery, or even a real murder among us, we feel that we have struck a rich lead, and publish glowing accounts thereof, well displayed, with sensational headings in big type, exclamation points, etc. Rev. Mr. Earle has a much better field for his peculiar operations the other side of the Rocky Mountains than he finds among us unsophisticated innocents. He'd better go back.</p><p>Accidental</p><p>Any person not conversant with the magnitude and extent of the mining and milling operations carried on in this County alone, would feel astonished and horrified at the frequency of painful, or fatal accidents occurring here to those engaged therein. They form a frightful source for items in the newspapers. Every day we read about some reckless engineer or mill hand losing more or less of his fingers by sticking them in among the cogs or other critical portions of the machinery. They are having quite a mania for that operation now-a-days, and it is perfectly refreshing to see how well they stand it and follow it up., In the mines, too, the boys manage to keep up the supply of jobs for the surgeon, or peg out in the endeavor. If they don't succeed in smashing up their arms, legs or heads among the hoisting machinery, or by caves in the mine, they contrive to drop down some shaft a few hundred feet or so, an average of about one dead miner a week being furnished gratuitously in this way. Familiarity with the dangers, makes them heedless of their presence. Old miners are the only ones who get badly hurt or killed; green hands never. A few days ago, little Joe, employed for a long time past as the pick and drill boy in the Savage mine, got hurt some. His business is - when on duty - to keep the miners throughout the mine supplied with sharp picks and drills, in the prosecution of which duty he is continually passing through some of the many shafts, drifts, and passages with a shoulder load of sharp tools from the blacksmith shop, or returning with dull ones. He knows where every dangerous hole is, but so well that he goes gaily hopping and whistling past them, as though they did not exist at all. On this occasion, though he unluckily happened to trip, and with his load of tools pitched head first down a gangway some fifteen feet into a chamber below, driving his little cranium with considerable force among a pile of thirty dollar ore. He describes the sensation as astonishing, and has been picking little chunks of quartz out of his scalp ever since. The picks and drills escaped uninjured.</p><p>Incidental</p><p>The small pox made its appearance here some six weeks ago, direct from San Francisco, and before effectual measures were taken to prevent it, it had spread to the extent of fifteen cases, only one, however, - that of a child - proving fatal. When Bro. Earle carne with his revival this loathsome disease immediately subsided and changed into the &quot;very Oh Lord.&quot; By the way, speaking of Bro. Earle, he makes the revival business pay. In Marysville, Cal., he made $6,000; in Sacramento, $6,500; Placerville, $2,500; and proportionate amounts in other towns and cities of that State and Oregon. He will probably clear $3,000 in this city. He opens at Gold Hill next, after which he will go through the sinners of Silver City, Dayton, Garson, and other places. He is doing well. Our markets are supplied now with plenty of vegetables, green peas, new potatoes, strawberries, last years' apples, oranges, bananas, pineapples and the various other tropical fruits now in season. All these good things come from across the Sierra, but are sold at reasonable prices. We have lively times here in the way of balls, dances, festivals and other amusements, and the spacious theatre is crowded each evening. An excellent dramatic company from San Francisco is performing there at present. There is one other Plymouthean, (E. H Morton) a fixture in this City besides myself, and let me assure you that the <em>Memorial and Rock</em> comes to us as a familiar and welcome old friend. We receive it with all reasonable regularity, and always read it through from beginning to end, advertisements and all. With its friendly pages to refresh our memories, we can never become in any degree oblivious of our childhood's happy home, or the loved friends and companions of our youthful days. In conclusion let me now bid you good-bye until you hear again from</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>A. D.</p>",public://rock/Rockns42.jpg
Rockns43,"<p>Nevada Correspondence.<br />No. XLIII.<br />Virignia, Nev., July 22, 1867.</p><p><em>Editor Memorial and Rock:</em></p><p>The Glorious Fourth</p><p>came and went at the usual time, and was generally observed throughout that portion of the Pacific coast included in Uncle Samuel's farm, after the good old style. Tons of gunpowder, ship loads of fire crackers, rockets, and all that sort of thing were destroyed, and noise, patriotism, &quot;marching through Georgia&quot; and general hilarity was the order of the day. In fact as far as this city was concerned, the way some fellows &quot;swung round the circle,&quot; and kept on &quot;marching through Georgia&quot; in every direction across and athwart it, that unfortunate state must have got pretty well cut up by crooked trails before midnight. We had a very lively and pleasing celebration of it. Our procession numbered from fifteen hundred to two thousand, and included five military companies, the fire department, the Miner's League - composed of some hundreds of the sturdy, honest fellows who delve away down in the bowels of the earth, hundreds of feet below and under the foundations of the houses, stores and streets of this city - the Fenian Brotherhood, various other civil associations, city officers, Governor Blasdell and staff, half a dozen bands of music, car of State, etc. Our fire department always forms the handsomest feature in the procession. We have six engines of the best pattern, (not steamers) one hook and ladder company and one hose company. Each company averaged over sixty men on this occasion, although their ranks were not full. Their machines were all very elegantly trimmed with flowers, wreaths, rosettes, flags, etc., and four of them were surmounted by splendid canopies, under each of which was a little &quot;Goddess of Liberty&quot; in full costume, and together with the boys themselves, dressed in their red shirts, black pants, handsome fire hats and belts, the whole presented a truly gorgeous spectacle. It is the best and most efficient volunteer fire department on the coast. The quantity of whiskey consumed on that day was considerable, but the quality must have been unusually bad, for things did not pass off quite as peaceably as they did the year previous. One man was killed in the evening by a policeman. There had been a row at a house of prostitution, in which a man got shot in the leg, and the policeman went there to see about it. Jack Dalton, acting as a sort of &quot;bully&quot; for the house, opposed the entrance of the officer, and stuck a Derringer pistol in his face. The policeman immediately shot him through the heart. He was honorably acquitted, on trial of the case. Two Mexicans cut each other with knives, satisfactory to both parties, a little Dutchman sportively shot himself through the foot, and an Irishman had about half the top of his head chipped off with a hatchet, by a rampart stable keeper. An inch and a half deeper would have cut off some of his brain, in which case, the wound would have been serious, perhaps.</p><p>Bad Whiskey</p><p>Speaking of whiskey, everybody conversant with the subject knows that the quality of this favorite beverage is extremely varied. Some of it is of fine quality, with high-toned taste and price, pleasing stimulative properties, and no bad after-notions; but there is one particular quality of whiskey which is most superlatively mean and rascally, and which really does exercise a very peculiar influence over all who partake of it. The first drink scratches your gullet, starts tears in your eyes and makes your finger and toe nails tingle; the second drink, you straighten up, feel resolute and defiant, have a great opinion of yourself, and are fully conscious there is more in you than people are aware of; the third drink you forget all the small debts you owe, grow oblivious of the big ones, and feel belligerent; the fourth drink, you are a horse, weigh a ton, curse the memory of your deceased grandmother, spit fiercely, double up your fists and look around for a muss; the fifth drink, it makes no difference if you are the kindest and most peaceable dispositioned man in the world, you've got to fight anyhow, and before you know it, almost, you'll be out in the middle of the floor, or street, with your shirt and hat off, waltzing about and just begging for some one to step out and fight you. (And you would'nt have to wait over seven minutes and a half here, either.) You'll get whipped nine time in ten minutes, and fetch up in the station house. Oh! this Donnybrook whiskey is gay; it's festive.</p><p>“Murder Will Out.”</p><p>I never knew or heard of a more perfect illustration of the truth of the above time honored saying, than the one I am about to relate. Jule Bulette, a well known prostitute, living in a little house alone by herself in the heart of this city, and within a hundred yards of the police station house, was found murdered in her bed, about noon on the 20th of last January. From the appearance of the body, she had been struck first on the head with a stick of stove wood, and afterwards strangled to death by means of a hand upon her throat (the marks of the fingers and thumb were printed there in plain blue characters) and a pillow over her face, which was found adhering fast to her mouth with dried clotted blood, which also issued from her ears. She had evidently been dead some hours. The last that was seen of her alive, was at 11½ o'clock the previous night, when she went to her house. She had a valuable lot of jewelry, furs, rich dresses, etc., all of which were stolen from her room, showing the evident object of the murderer to be plunder. This horrible affair created a great sensation at the time, and parties were arrested on suspicion of having committed the terrible crime; no real clue to the true murderer, however, was found, notwithstanding the utmost vigilance on the part of the police, and it soon passed to be among the mysteries which could not be solved. </p><p>Three months afterward, a man named John Millean, well known in this city, was arrested on charge of attempting to murder and rob Martha Camp, in a similar manner to that in which Jule Bulette was murdered and robbed, and while in jail, it was found that he had, previous to his arrest, sold a fine silk dress pattern to a lady in Gold Hill, for less than half its real value. This dress was of a very peculiar pattern, and was identified as belonging to Jule Bulette; she had purchased it only a few days before her death. One clue led to another, until at length all the rest of the stolen property was found in Milliean's trunk, at the house where he left it. Other circumstances went to prove who the murderer of that poor woman really was; besides which, Milliean confessed in the jail that he together with two others did the job. </p><p>The names of the men he gave as his accomplices, were doubtless fictitious, for the men were never found or heard of. His trial before the District court occupied but one day, and on the 5th inst he was condemned to be hung on the 23d of next month. He will be the first man ever hung in this county, unless something turns up to prevent. There have been plenty of men shot, cut, and otherwise slaughtered here, but there were always some extenuating circumstances in each case, so that sentence of death was never pronounced before now. </p><p>The evidence against Milliean was purely circumstantial, for no one saw him commit the horrid crime, except God, yet the chain of evidence aside from his own confession, was so perfect and overwhelmingly convincing that no other conclusion could possibly be arrived at. He made no defense whatever. He possessed the strongest nerve and most dogged command over his feelings, of any man I ever saw. I reported the trial, and therefore had a good opportunity of observing him. The spacious court room was crowded, and all eyes eagerly scanned the prisoner, especially on the day sentence was pronounced. He stood up firmly, and when the judge read the words condemning him to be hung by the neck till he was dead, every eye in the hall was upon him, yet he quailed not; he never changed a muscle of his countenance in the least, but soon afterward walked out with a firm step, when the sheriff escorted him back to his strong cell. He is evidently a hardened wretch, and is more than suspected of two or three other murders of a similar nature. It is said he will make a full written confession.</p><p>Powerful Burglars</p><p>I don't think we have any smarter burglars here than you have in the Atlantic cities, but we have fully as powerful ones as you can scare up, and who always make a capital good showing of extensive and heavy work done, whenever they start at it. They never steal anything they can't carry off, and never leave anything even in that case without trying it a hitch. Hot stoves, mill-stones, wagons, and even quartz mills they regard as legitimate subjects for plunder. They look upon it as mere pastime to back their wagon up to a house in the night, steal all the furniture, take up the carpets, and in fact, sack the premises and drive off without disturbing the inmates at all from their slumbers. A watch dog would be of no use; they'd steal him too. Heavy quartz mill machinery, of tons in weight is not at all safe to leave unwatched; even small houses are sometimes carried off without the consent of the proprietors. Speaking of that, however, it seems they have at least one mighty powerful man in San Francisco, for a few days ago, William Culler commenced suit in the Twelfth District court in that city, against Charles R. Butler, alleging that he hired a house of the defendant on Pine street, and while in the occupation thereof, the defendant &quot;wrongfully entered the said dwelling house of said plaintiff, and with great force and violence seized said house is which the plaintiff with his family resided, and in which his goods and chattels then were as aforesaid, and with great force and violence lifted said house from the ground on which it then and there stood, on Pine street aforesaid, and with great force and violence carried said house, together with the plaintiff's family, from said place as aforesaid to Austin street, in said city and county;&quot; for which plaintiff claims $5000 damages on account of the disturbance and annoyance.</p><p>Miscellaneous</p><p>Business is better in this city and county than ever before, and no one complains of hard times. All the quartz mills are steadily running, and the mines yielding better ore and more of it, than before known of since they were first discovered. The sidewalks are crowded from early morn to dewy eve with a bustling throng of people passing along each with their own peculiar motive in view, and vehicles of all kinds, from the huge twelve mule &quot;prairie schooner&quot; with its cargo of merchandise, or the heavy quartz wagons loaded with ore, passing from mine to mill, down to the gentle Washoe canary (jackass) with his back load of firewood, and driven by a Chinaman, pass along in continual stream through the streets. The merchants all say they are doing an excellent business, and that of itself is a fair indication of lively times in any town or city anywhere in creation, consists in the fact that all places of amusement and where surplus money can be spent, are well patronized. This is especially the case here, now. Two theatres and a circus are running full houses every night (Sunday and all,) the principal theatre - Piper's Opera House - holding frequently over a thousand people, besides which, the evening air is resonant with the strains of piano, harp, and violin issuing from the numerous lager beer saloons, where merry men congregate about little side tables, singing songs, or chatting familiarly with the pretty waiter girls, who with roseate cheeks and smiling lips welcome them and seductively induce them to spend their money free. Neither are the churches neglected, for they also run full houses, and we have more of them, and fully as large as you have in Plymouth. On the 19th of May last, we had a light fall of snow at daylight in the morning, which whitened the ground, since which time no drop of moisture has fallen from the heavens, upon Virginia. We don't need any rain however, fort this is a mining country almost exclusively, but little of it being adapted to agricultural purposes, within eight miles of here. There are good lands in the valleys, but irrigation is there employed and rain not taken into consideration.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>A. D.</p>",public://rock/Rockns43.jpg
